   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide health care providers, patients, and the general public with a responsible assessment of currently available data regarding celiac disease. PARTICIPANTS: A non-DHHS, non-advocate 13-member panel representing the fields of internal medicine, gastroenterology, medical genetics, pathology, endocrinology, nutrition, and a consumer representative. In addition, 19 experts in related fields presented data to the panel and to the conference audience. EVIDENCE: Presentations by experts; a systematic review of the medical literature provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; and an extensive bibliography of celiac disease research papers, prepared by the National Library of Medicine. Scientific evidence was given precedence over clinical anecdotal experience. CONFERENCE PROCESS: Answering pre-determined questions, the panel drafted its statement based on scientific evidence presented in open forum and on the published scientific literature. The draft statement was read in its entirety on the final day of the conference and circulated to the audience for comment. The panel then met in executive session to consider the comments received, and released a revised statement later that day at http://consensus.nih.gov. This statement is an independent report of the panel and is not a policy statement of the NIH or the Federal Government. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated intestinal disorder with protean manifestations. Celiac disease is common, affecting 0.5 to 1.0 percent of the general population of the United States, but is greatly underdiagnosed. There are now specific and sensitive serologic tests available to aid in diagnosis that need to be more widely applied. The treatment of celiac disease remains a lifelong gluten-free diet, which results in remission for most individuals. The classic presentation of diarrhea and malabsorption is less common, and atypical and silent presentations are increasing. Most individuals are being seen by primary care providers and a broad range of specialists. Therefore, heightened awareness of this disease is imperative. Education of physicians, registered dietitians, and other health providers is needed. The panel recommends the following: (1) Education of physicians, dietitians, nurses, and the public about celiac disease by a trans-National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiative, to be led by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), in association with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; (2) Standardization of serologic tests and pathologic criteria for the diagnosis of celiac disease; (3) Adoption of a standard definition of a gluten-free diet based on objective evidence such as that being developed by the American Dietetic Association; (4) Development of an adequate testing procedure for gluten in foods and definition of standards for gluten-free foods in the United States to lay the foundation for rational food labeling; (5) Formation of a federation of celiac disease societies, celiac disease interest groups, individuals with celiac disease and their families, physicians, dietitians, and other health care providers for the advancement of education, research, and advocacy for individuals with celiac disease.},

Although most symptomatic patients have symptoms related to the gastrointestinal tract, many extra-intestinal manifestations have been described. A wide spectrum of hepatobiliary diseases have been described, including asymptomatic elevations of liver enzyme levels, nonspecific hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and autoimmune and cholestatic liver disease. In addition, celiac disease may be the underlying cause of unexplained elevations of liver enzyme levels. Because most patients do not have overt gastrointestinal symptoms, a high index of suspicion is required. Moreover, in the majority of patients, liver enzyme levels will normalize on a gluten-free diet. We review the literature pertaining to hepatic abnormalities that may be seen in association with celiac disease. We also suggest an approach to the investigation and management of these patients.},

The damaging factor is gluten present in wheat, barley and rye. The diagnosis relies on the clinical picture of the patient, serological markers for coeliac disease, characteristic findings of small intestinal biopsy and, eventually, clinical improvement on a gluten-free diet. Our strategies for the diagnosis of coeliac disease have changed dramatically within the last 10 years. The advent of serological markers with high sensitivity and specificity is changing our understanding of the disease and its prevalence. Treatment includes a life-long gluten-free diet to prevent the recurrence of symptoms and other potential consequences. Most coeliac disease remains under-diagnosed; the utilization of more accurate serological tests and a greater awareness of its many presentations will aid its identification.},

Among 115 adults with biopsy-proven celiac disease who fulfilled strict criteria, including serologic testing at the time of diagnosis and response to a gluten-free diet, 71% had total villous atrophy and 29% partial villous atrophy. Endomysial antibody was positive in 77% of those with total villous atrophy, compared to 33% with partial villous atrophy (P < 0.001). There was no difference in sensitivity when the type of presentation (classical vs. silent) was compared. Endomysial antibody-positive and negative patients did not differ with respect to age at diagnosis, duration of symptoms, mode of presentation, or family history of celiac disease. All anti-tissue transglutaminase-positive patients had TVA on biopsy. Seronegative celiac disease occurs. Endomysial antibody positivity correlates with more severe villous atrophy and not mode of presentation of celiac disease. Serologic tests, in clinical practice, lack the sensitivity reported in the literature.},

   abstract = {In the last years our knowledge on epidemiology of celiac disease has increased: there is a wide spectrum of its clinical presentation (classical, atypical, silent and latent forms of celiac disease), and of its pathological mucosal intestinal features, which range from early and mild pictures to severe villous atrophy (Marsh stages). In addition, a strong genetic component, associated with the susceptibility to the disease (HLA and non HLA genes), has been found. This knowledge, together with the availability of new high sensitive and specific serological tests (antigliadin, antiendomysium and antitransglutaminase antibodies), has led us to the realization that celiac disease is the most common food intolerance in the world, involving genetically predisposed individuals consuming gluten-containing cereals in their diet. So, today it is well known that celiac disease is a common disorder not only in Europe but also in populations of European ancestry (North and South Americas, Australia), in North Africa, in the Middle East and in South Asia, where until a few years ago it was historically considered extremely rare. Therefore, celiac disease is spread worldwide as in a common "Global Village", and greater levels of awareness and attention on gluten intolerance are needed, both in the Old and in the New World.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression are common features of coeliac disease. Depression is cause of non-compliance to treatment in chronic illness. AIM: To evaluate the useful of psychological support counselling to improve affective disorders and gluten-free diet adherence in coeliac disease with anxiety and depression. METHODS: A total of 66 coeliac disease patients with state anxiety and current depression were enrolled. Patients were randomized in two groups: in group A psychological support was started at the beginning of gluten-free diet, while group B was free of psychological support. Both groups were followed every 2 weeks for 6 months. State and Trait Anxiety Inventory test Y-1 and the modified Zung self-rating depression scale were administered before (T0) and after 6 months of gluten-free diet (T1). RESULTS: At T1 no difference was found between groups in the percentage of state anxiety, while a significant lower percentage of depressed subjects was found in group A with respect to group B (15.1% vs. 78.8%; P=0.001). In the follow-up period, a significant lower compliance to gluten-free diet was found in group B with respect to group A (39.4% vs. 9.1%; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In coeliac disease patients with affective disorders psychological support seems to be able to reduce depression and to increase gluten-free diet compliance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neurological and psychiatric disorders occur in approximately 10% of patients with celiac disease. Although some of these alterations respond to a gluten-free diet, the etiology of these abnormalities is uncertain. Because of a case report that cerebral hypoperfusion in a celiac patient resolved after a gluten-free diet, we studied brain perfusion changes in untreated celiac patients, treated celiac patients, and healthy controls. METHODS: A total of 15 untreated celiac patients without conditions affecting brain perfusion were enrolled; none had neurological or psychiatric disorders other than anxiety or depression. We also studied 15 celiac patients who were on a gluten-free diet for almost 1 year, and 24 healthy volunteers of similar sex and age. All subjects underwent cerebral single photon emission computed tomography examination. RESULTS: Of the 15 untreated celiac patients, 11 (73%) had at least one hypoperfused brain region, compared with only 1 (7%) of the 15 celiac patients on a gluten-free diet and none of the controls (P = 0.01). Cerebral perfusion was significantly lower (P <0.05) in untreated celiac patients, compared with healthy controls, in 7 of 26 brain regions. No significant differences in cerebral perfusion were found between celiac patients on a gluten-free diet and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: There is evidence of regional cerebral blood flow alteration in untreated celiac patients.},

METHOD: Here we describe a case of psoriasis in a CD patient not responding to specific therapies for psoriasis. RESULT: The regression of skin lesions after gluten-free diet (GFD) was evident in a short time. CONCLUSION: The present case supports the association between CD and psoriasis and the concept that psoriasis in CD patients can be improved by GFD. Future studies are needed to clarify the possible mechanisms involved in this association.},

Six of the 10 subjects had jejunal biopsy, which showed total villus atrophy. Four subjects did not undergo jejunal biopsy. The gender ratio of the biopsy positive is 5 male:1 female. All subjects with IgA positive were put on gluten free diet and normalized in a few months. CONCLUSION: The maximum prevalence of celiac disease in our population was 8.1% based on immunological marker and the minimum was 4.9% based on antibodies and biopsy results.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two children (24 females) with JRA, aged between 5-15 years underwent study of serologic markers for CD (gliadin-IgA, gliadin-IgG, reticulin and endomysium-IgA antibodies). Endoscopic intestinal biopsy was performed in patients who had positive serologic markers for CD. The diagnosis of CD was based on the classic finding of villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (42.8%) had serologic markers for CD; ten of them with a systemic form, five with a polyarticular form and three with a pauciarticular form of JRA. Levels of AGA -IgG were high in 14 patients (77.8%), four patients (22.2%) had high levels of AGA-IgA and seven patients (38.9%) had anti-endomysium antibodies (AEA). One patient had anti-reticulin antibodies (ARA) 5.5%. Sixteen patients underwent intestinal biopsy; in only one patient with AEA antibodies (2.38%), biopsy revealed typical finding of CD. The patient with CD showed improvement in both growth parameter as well as articular symptoms after starting gluten-free diet CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the screening for silent CD among children with JRA may be useful. Those patients with AEA need further follow up since these antibodies are quite sensitive and specific for CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) may be associated with other immunologic disorders in adults and children. Previous studies linking CD and autoimmune thyroid disease in children have included very few patients with limited biochemical and immunologic screening tests. The aim of this multicenter study was to establish the prevalence of autoimmune thyroid involvement in a large series of pediatric patients with CD. METHODS: Five hundred seventy-three consecutive pediatric patients were enrolled from clinics in Torino, Bologna, Foggia, Rome (two clinics), Naples, and Bari. Three hundred forty-three patients with CD were studied, 230 girls and 113 boys (median age, 8.5 years). Two hundred fifty-six of the patients with CD (median age, 9 years) had been following a gluten-free diet for 3 months to 16 years; 87 patients were untreated (median age, 6.2 years). The diagnosis of CD was made using the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criteria. A control group of 230 subjects (median age, 8.3 years) was enrolled. Serum free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), antithyroperoxidase, antithyroglobulin, anti-TSH receptor antibodies, and thyroid echographic pattern were considered. RESULTS: Autoimmune thyroid disease was found in 90 of 343 (26.2%) patients with CD (62 on a gluten-free diet) and in 20 (10%) of the control subjects (P = 0.001). Fifty-four (15.7%) patients with CD and autoimmune markers had normal thyroid function (euthyroidism) as did 12 (6.0%) of the control subjects; hypothyroidism was observed in 28 (8.1%) patients with CD and in 7 (3.5%) of the control subjects. Hyperthyroidism was diagnosed in four patients with CD and in none of the control subjects with autoimmune markers. An abnormal echographic pattern was seen in 37 patients with CD (16.8%) and only in 1 (1.6%) of the control subjects (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of autoimmune thyroid disease found among patients with CD, even those on a gluten-free diet, may justify a thyroid status assessment at diagnosis and at follow-up evaluation of children with CD.},

The diagnosis of CD is confirmed by a combination of clinical, serological, and morphological findings associated with a response to a gluten-free diet. In small-bowel mucosal biopsy specimens, abnormalities range from minimal (increased villous intraepithelial lymphocytes only) to severe (complete villous blunting with crypt hyperplasia). Recognition of CD is important because appropriate therapy of this condition will obviate the risk of its severe complications.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus can frequently coexist, presumably due to a common genetic predisposition. The present study was designed to evaluate the frequency of coeliac disease among Hungarian diabetic children and to study the effect of gluten-free diet on glycaemic control. A total of 205 diabetic children (age range 2.0-17.0 years, median 11.6 years) were screened for coeliac disease by determination of IgA-endomysium (EMA) antibodies. In the positive cases, a jejunal biopsy was performed and, in addition to routine histology, the number of intraepithelial gamma/delta T-cells was also determined. Insulin requirement, glycosylated haemoglobin level and body mass index of diabetic children with coeliac disease were determined before and 3 months after the introduction of gluten-free diet. IgA-EMA was positive in 24 cases, 17 of them (8.3% of all diabetic children) had a subtotal villous atrophy and thus coeliac disease was diagnosed. In all but two of these children, the mean number of gamma/delta T-cells was elevated (above 7 cells/mm). Of the remaining seven patients with positive EMA but normal villous structure, five (2.4%) had elevated number of epithelial gamma/delta T-cells, indicating probable latent coeliac disease. The insulin requirement of the children had significantly increased 3 months after the introduction of gluten-free diet (median values 0.64 versus 0.48 U/kg per day, P<0.05). Median body mass indices also showed significant elevation after this period (16.8 versus 14.2 kg/m(2), P<0.05) CONCLUSION: the frequency of coeliac disease was high in the studied group. Introduction of a gluten-free diet improved the somatic development of these children. A latent form of coeliac disease is also frequent in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a small intestinal inflammatory disorder characterized by malabsorption, nutrient deficiency, and a range of clinical manifestations. It is caused by an inappropriate immune response to dietary gluten and is treated with a gluten-free diet. Recent feeding studies have indicated oats to be safe for celiac disease patients, and oats are now often included in the celiac disease diet. This study aimed to investigate whether oat intolerance exists in celiac disease and to characterize the cells and processes underlying this intolerance. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We selected for study nine adults with celiac disease who had a history of oats exposure. Four of the patients had clinical symptoms on an oats-containing diet, and three of these four patients had intestinal inflammation typical of celiac disease at the time of oats exposure. We established oats-avenin-specific and -reactive intestinal T-cell lines from these three patients, as well as from two other patients who appeared to tolerate oats. The avenin-reactive T-cell lines recognized avenin peptides in the context of HLA-DQ2. These peptides have sequences rich in proline and glutamine residues closely resembling wheat gluten epitopes. Deamidation (glutamine-->glutamic acid conversion) by tissue transglutaminase was involved in the avenin epitope formation. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that some celiac disease patients have avenin-reactive mucosal T-cells that can cause mucosal inflammation. Oat intolerance may be a reason for villous atrophy and inflammation in patients with celiac disease who are eating oats but otherwise are adhering to a strict gluten-free diet. Clinical follow-up of celiac disease patients eating oats is advisable.},

   abstract = {A lymphocytic enterocolitis has been reported in a cohort of children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. This study tested the hypothesis that dysregulated intestinal mucosal immunity with enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production is present in these ASD children. Comparison was made with developmentally normal children with, and without, mucosal inflammation. Duodenal and colonic biopsies were obtained from 21 ASD children, and 65 developmentally normal paediatric controls, of which 38 had signs of histological inflammation. Detection of CD3+ lymphocyte staining for spontaneous intracellular TNFalpha, IL-2, IL-4, IFNgamma, and IL-10, was performed by multicolor flow cytometry. Duodenal and colonic mucosal CD3+ lymphocyte counts were elevated in ASD children compared with noninflamed controls (p<0.03). In the duodenum, the proportion of lamina propria (LP) and epithelial CD3(+)TNFalpha+ cells in ASD children was significantly greater compared with noninflamed controls (p<0.002) but not coeliac disease controls. In addition, LP and epithelial CD3(+)IL-2+ and CD3(+)IFNgamma+, and epithelial CD3(+)IL-4+ cells were more numerous in ASD children than in noninflamed controls (p<0.04). In contrast, CD3(+)IL-10+ cells were fewer in ASD children than in noninflamed controls (p<0.05). In the colon, LP CD3(+)TNFalpha+ and CD3(+)IFNgamma+ were more frequent in ASD children than in noninflamed controls (p<0.01). In contrast with Crohn's disease and non-Crohn's colitis, LP and epithelial CD3(+)IL-10+ cells were fewer in ASD children than in nondisease controls (p<0.01). There was a significantly greater proportion of CD3(+)TNFalpha+ cells in colonic mucosa in those ASD children who had no dietary exclusion compared with those on a gluten and/or casein free diet (p<0.05). There is a consistent profile of CD3+ lymphocyte cytokines in the small and large intestinal mucosa of these ASD children, involving increased pro-inflammatory and decreased regulatory activities. The data provide further evidence of a diffuse mucosal immunopathology in some ASD children and the potential for benefit of dietary and immunomodulatory therapies.},

We have evaluated inflammation and the mucosal immune response to gliadin in the jejunum of patients with type 1 diabetes. Small intestinal biopsies from 17 children with type 1 diabetes without serological markers of celiac disease and from 50 age-matched control subjects were examined by immunohistochemistry. In addition, biopsies from 12 type 1 diabetic patients and 8 control subjects were cultured with gliadin or ovalbumin peptic-tryptic digest and examined for epithelial infiltration and lamina propria T-cell activation. The density of intraepithelial CD3(+) and gammadelta(+) cells and of lamina propria CD25(+) mononuclear cells was higher in jejunal biopsies from type 1 diabetic patients versus control subjects. In the patients' biopsies cultured with peptic-tryptic gliadin, there was epithelial infiltration by CD3(+) cells, a significant increase in lamina propria CD25(+) and CD80(+) cells and enhanced expression of lamina propria CD54 and crypt HLA-DR. No such phenomena were observed in control subjects, even those with celiac disease-associated HLA haplotypes. In conclusion, signs of mucosal inflammation were present in jejunal biopsies from type 1 diabetic patients, and organ culture studies indicate a deranged mucosal immune response to gliadin.},

It can manifest in any age group but it is becoming more commonly diagnosed in adulthood. Very rarely it manifests during pregnancy or after childbirth, possibly due to hormonal and immunological changes. In authors' case a young female developed severe diarrhoea resulting in malabsorption following both of her pregnancies. On the first presentation the gluten sensitive enteropathy was not diagnosed despite detailed gastroenterological and endocrine workup. Following her first pregnancy she remained free of symptoms for years on a normal diet. After the birth of her second child her symptoms flared up and she was admitted to authors' department. The diagnosis of coeliac disease was confirmed by the histological finding from a small bowel biopsy. The coeliac specific serologic markers were also positive (antibodies to gliadin, endomysium and tissue transglutaminase). Significant improvement was achieved with supportive therapy and gluten-free diet. Despite the fact that authors' patient's symptoms were transient, the diagnosis of latent coeliac disease seems to be evident. Lifelong gluten-free diet is mandatory to prevent the late complications.},

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects on long-term remission of dermatitis herpetiformis in patients who underwent a gluten challenge and subsequently reintroduced dietary gluten. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 38 patients (14 male and 24 female) with biopsy-confirmed dermatitis herpetiformis. They had followed a gluten-free diet for a mean of 8 years, achieving clinical remission and intestinal normalization. The patients were asked to reintroduce gluten in their diet and agreed to undergo skin and intestinal biopsies during the follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 38 patients abandoning a gluten-free diet, 31 reported the onset of rash within an average of 2 months. Seven subjects (three males, mean age 15 years at challenge) experienced no clinical or histological relapses (median follow-up 12 years), and lost IgA immunoglobulin from the skin. The two series of patients differed in terms of age at diagnosis (mean age: 26.6 vs. 6 years), the use of dapsone (one of 31 vs. four of seven) and adherence to the gluten-free diet (strict compliance in 26 of 31 vs. none of seven). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the ingestion of small doses of gluten in childhood and/or the use of an anti-inflammatory drug may modify the immunological response inducing immune tolerance. We report long-term clinical and histological remissions in seven patients with dermatitis herpetiformis after the reintroduction of dietary gluten.},

Coeliac disease, a curable disorder characterised by inflammatory mucosal damage, may show hepatic histological features similar to steatohepatitis. Conflicting data have been reported on the prevalence of coeliac disease in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. AIM: To search for coeliac disease in a series of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by screening with anti-tissue transglutaminase and anti-endomysium antibodies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine consecutive patients with hypertransaminasemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, 38 (64%) with steatohepatitis. Anti-endomysium antibodies were assayed by indirect immunofluorescence, IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase by ELISA. Patients who tested positive underwent HLA DQ typing and endoscopy. RESULTS: Tissue transglutaminase antibodies were positive in six (10%) patients and anti-endomysium in two (3.4%); only two (3.4%), positive for both anti-endomysium positive and anti-transglutaminase, resulted to have coeliac disease based on histological findings. After 6 months of gluten-free diet, liver enzymes normalised. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of silent coeliac disease is 3.4% in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver. The inclusion of anti-endomysium antibodies test in studying patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver and persistent biochemical abnormalities has to be taken into account, since positivity for tissue transglutaminase antibodies, in the absence of confirmatory anti-endomysium antibodies, is not sufficient to perform diagnostic endoscopy.},

The mechanisms underlying such changes are still poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: In a longitudinal study, we monitored changes in bone metabolism during consumption of a GFD. DESIGN: We studied 22 white patients with celiac disease (11 girls) aged 10.5 +/- 1.0 y at the time of diagnosis. We compared bone metabolism and bone mass values in these patients with those in 428 healthy white children aged 11.3 +/- 0.2 y. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (a bone formation index) and N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx; a bone resorption marker) were measured at the time of diagnosis and after 2, 6, and 12 mo of the GFD. Bone mineral content was measured at the lumbar spine and for the whole skeleton. RESULTS: The bone mineral content of patients was significantly lower than that of control subjects at the time of diagnosis but not after 1 y of the GFD. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase concentrations of patients were significantly lower than those of control subjects at the time of diagnosis (P = 0.0064) and increased gradually and significantly during the GFD (ANOVA F = 4.71; P = 0.024). Conversely, patients with untreated disease had significantly higher urinary concentrations of NTx than did healthy control subjects (P < 0.0001). Urinary concentrations of NTx were not significantly affected by treatment (P = 0.37). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of bone metabolism is altered in children with untreated celiac disease, and these alterations may be the cause of osteopathy. Remarkable changes occur after the initiation of a GFD, and they result in a more balanced equilibrium.},

HFE mutations, frequent in Caucasian populations, can cause increased intestinal iron absorption and thus could protect against the development of iron deficiency. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of HFE mutations and their effect on iron metabolism in Italian celiac patients at diagnosis and after a gluten-free diet. DESIGN AND METHODS: C282Y and H63D mutations were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme digestion in 203 patients with celiac disease and in 206 controls. HLA alleles were determined by sequence-specific primers and PCR. Duodenal histology was graded using Marsh's classification, and iron parameters measured by standard techniques. RESULTS: The frequency of the C282Y mutation was similar in celiac patients and controls (0.034 vs. 0.031); comparable frequencies were detected also for the H63D allele (0.170 vs. 0.136 in celiac patients and controls, respectively). Neither of the two HFE mutations affected iron indices in celiac patients at diagnosis, whereas a significant inverse correlation was detected between hemoglobin or ferritin and severity of histological damage (Marsh 3C or 3B vs. 3A, p<0.05 for both parameters). After a gluten-free diet, a slight increase in hemoglobin levels was observed in C282Y carriers as compared to controls, but only in female patients (p=0.044). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In Italian patients with untreated celiac disease, HFE mutations do not constitute a protective factor against the development of iron deficiency, which seems to be mainly determined by the severity of the intestinal lesions.},

The presence of antitransglutaminase and antiendomysium antibodies and the jejunal biopsy specimen findings showed an underlying celiac disease. On a strict gluten-free diet, the skin lesions resolved and the girl has since remained symptom free for 9 months. Thus celiac disease can be a triggering factor for erythema nodosum. In the chronic form of the skin lesions, serologic testing for this specific enteropathy may be justified.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In coeliac disease (CD) patients, the dominant DQ2-Alpha-I-gliadin peptide recognised by CD4 T cells is contained within peptide sequence 57-73 (p57-73) of Alpha-gliadin. This peptide sequence is also located within a 33-mer protease resistant gliadin fragment and therefore is likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of CD. AIMS: Our aim was to determine whether a B cell epitope was present within the immunodominant T cell epitope of Alpha-gliadin and, if so, to elucidate its sequence and determine the importance of deamidation and/or modification of the amino acid at position 65 for IgA binding. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of CD patients, disease controls, and healthy individuals were examined. Serum IgA antibodies to the native and modified p57-73 fragment of Alpha-gliadin were analysed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. Peptide scanning experiments were further used to elucidate the B cell epitope. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: IgA antibodies to p57-73 were found in 29/72 (40.2%) endomysial antibody positive patients, all of whom had CD. The peptide antibody appeared to be present when patients were on a diet containing gluten and declined on a gluten free diet. The p57-73 antibody was very specific for CD (98%) and had a sensitivity of 56%. The amino acid at position 65 was not important for IgA binding but was crucial for T cell recognition of p57-73. Pentapeptide PXPQP emerges as a potentially strong candidate for the IgA binding motif in this region of Alpha-gliadin. This study shows that a significant proportion of newly diagnosed CD patients have an antibody response to the immunodominant T cell epitope.},

METHODS: The level of IgA antibodies to tTG in serum was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test using recombinant human tTG as the antigen; IgA EMA, by indirect immunofluorescence; and IgA and IgG AGA, by ELISA. Sixty-eight serum samples from 59 patients with CD were studied-30 patients had untreated CD, 22 were on gluten-free diets, and 16 had been reintroduced to gluten-and compared with serum samples from 116 children examined for failure to thrive, short stature, various digestive diseases, or other non-CD conditions. RESULTS: Twenty-eight of 30 patients with CD had anti-tTG (the 2 patients whose results were negative were 1 patient with IgA deficiency and 1 infant); 27 of 30 patients had IgA EMA (1 child was IgA anti-tTG positive and IgA EMA negative); 18 of 30 had IgA AGA; and 28 of 30 had IgG AGA. On gluten-free diets, 4 of 22 patients had anti-tTG but none had IgA EMA or IgA AGA. On normal diets, 15 of 15 children who had relapsed had anti-tTG; 9, IgA EMA; 4, IgA AGA; and 8, IgG AGA (1 child did not relapse). In subjects without CD, 3 of 116 had anti-tTG; 12, IgG AGA; and 1, IgA AGA, but none had IgA EMA. In the 3 children who had anti-tTG, CD could be excluded. The positive predictive value of IgA anti-tTG was 90% and the negative predictive value, 98%. In comparison, results for IgA EMA were 100% and 97%, IgA AGA 94% and 90%, and IgG AGA 70% and 98%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The presence of human anti-tTG is a reliable indicator for the diagnosis and follow-up of CD.},

A 40-year-old woman with a 15-year history of immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin M hypergammaglobulinaemia, chronic diarrhoea, persistent mild aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation and anaemic syndrome was admitted to hospital because in the previous 3 months she had developed amenorrhoea, dizziness, alopecia, constipation, pallor and asthenia. Biochemical and immunological analyses showed macroamylasaemia. The patient presented clinical and intestinal histopathological features of coeliac disease. Immunological abnormalities included the presence of antigliadin, antiendomysium, antitransglutaminase, antinuclear, antismooth muscle and anti-SSA/Ro antibodies. Macroamylase resulted in a complex of amylase and immunoglobulin A. Later clinical follow-up of a gluten-free diet showed a transitory decrease in seric immunoglobulin A and macroamylase with persistent autoantibodies and AST elevation. An intestinal mucosal immune disorder could lead to coeliac disease and macroamylasaemia in a patient with Down syndrome presenting other immune alterations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently there has been increasing interest in the production of gluten-free (GF) foods and studies on minor cereals and pseudocereals without celiac activity in order to fulfill the specific needs of people affected by celiac disease. GF bread, pasta, biscuits are usually manufactured using different combinations of thickenings and particular food processing procedures that could affect starch digestibility. Carbohydrates, mainly starch from cereals, play an important part in a balanced diet, and dietary guidelines suggest a diet with low glycemic index foods, that is to say rich in slowly digested carbohydrates. AIM: The present study was aimed at evaluating: 1) the importance of some GF food characteristics in relation to their effects on in vitro starch accessibility to digestion, in comparison with traditional gluten products; 2) the in vivo metabolic responses to GF foods. METHODS: Firstly, starch digestibility of several products was evaluated in vitro. Then, an in vivo study was performed on a group of healthy volunteers. Postprandial glucose and insulin responses were evaluated after administration of three GF foods and traditional bread. Triglycerides and free fatty acids (FFA) were also evaluated. Attempts were also made to explore differences in metabolic responses to GF foods in healthy subjects with respect to celiac subjects. RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) of digested starch of GF bread was slightly higher than that of the traditional counterpart. No significant difference was observed in AUCs of digested starch between GF pasta and the traditional pasta. The AUCs of digested starch of quinoa and the two samples of pasta were not statistically different. Significant differences were observed between GF bread and bread-like products. Statistic differences in glucose responses to GF pasta were observed between healthy and celiac subjects. In healthy subjects, the AUCs of glucose response after GF bread were higher than those after bread with gluten. No significant differences were observed between the AUCs of insulin responses to all products tested. Glycemic index (GI) for GF pasta was similar to GI for GF bread while GI for quinoa was slightly lower than that of GF pasta and bread. Two-way ANOVA revealed that quinoa induced lower FFA levels with respect to GF pasta. In addition, triglyceride concentrations were significantly reduced for quinoa with respect to GF bread and bread. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the different formulations and the food processing procedures used in the manufacturing of GF products may affect the rate of starch digestion both in vitro and in vivo. It may be worthwhile improving the formulation of these products. Furthermore, quinoa seems to represent a potential alternative to traditional foods, even if further and larger studies are required to demonstrate its hypoglycemic effects.},

AIMS: To apply this straightforward method in duodenal biopsy specimens from patients affected by potential coeliac disease (PCD) to verify whether it can discriminate these patients from controls. METHODS: Paraffin wax embedded duodenal sections from 11 patients affected by PCD were stained with an antihuman CD3 antibody. Sections from 19 patients affected by treated coeliac disease (TCD) and 17 patients in whom coeliac disease was excluded were stained with the same antibody to serve as controls. The slides were examined blindly. IELs/20 enterocytes in five randomly chosen villous tips were counted. Patients affected by PCD were all on a gluten containing diet. They had an architecturally normal duodenal mucosa and were positive for endomysial antibody. Both TCD and non-coeliac controls were negative for endomysial antibody. RESULTS: The mean villous tip IEL scores were 4.6 (SD, 1.5; range, 1.4-7.8) in non-coeliac controls, 7.9 (SD, 4.0; range, 2.0-18.6) in TCD, and 9.2 (SD, 4.7; range, 5.8-21.8) in patients with PCD. The difference between PCD and non-coeliac controls was significant. CONCLUSIONS: This is a very simple and sufficiently reliable method to count IELs. In patients with an architecturally normal duodenal mucosa, the IEL count in villous tips helps to distinguish between patients with PCD and non-coeliac controls.},

Immunoglobulin G anti-ganglioside antibodies have been reported in coeliac disease patients with neuropathy, suggesting an immune response to peripheral nerve antigens. No data are so far available on anti-ganglioside antibodies in coeliac disease children or on antibody modifications after gluten-free diet. AIM: To evaluate the presence of antibodies to ganglioside antigens in children with coeliac disease, their modification after gluten-free diet, and possible correlations with neurological manifestations. METHODS: Sera from 42 coeliac disease children, before and after gluten-free diet, were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence of antibodies (immunoglobulin M, immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G) to gangliosides. Thirty-five sera of age-matched children with dyspepsia were used as control. RESULTS: High anti-ganglioside antibodies titres were present in two patients. In one patient, antibody titre reversed after gluten-free diet, whereas in the other one the titre increased after diet. Neither one complained of neurological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-ganglioside antibodies do not seem to correlate with gluten ingestion or with neurological manifestations in children with coeliac disease. Mechanisms different from gluten exposure may be implicated in the antibody production. An ongoing prospective study will help clarify the role, if any, of these antibodies in coeliac disease.},

However, it has only been in the past decade that the use of ingredients with a high resistant starch content has occurred in foods, initially in Australia but now throughout the world. Foods containing these resistant starch-rich ingredients include not only staple foods, such as bread and breakfast cereals, but also foods designed for those with special physiological or medical needs, such as celiac sensitivity and ulcerative colitis, or for individuals who are seeking to manage energy intake and control weight. Resistant starch has other benefits when compared with traditional sources of dietary fiber in that the preparation and design of foods with additional health benefits have the appearance, taste, and texture characteristics that encourage people to consume these "better for you" foods. As our knowledge of the range of physiological effects that occur through the consumption of resistant starch increases, more applications will be found for their inclusion in an expanding range of foods around the world.},

METHODS: Cross-sectional survey, with case note review of 130 adult patients with coeliac disease (90 white Caucasian and 40 South Asians). RESULTS: 87 (66.9%) of the 130 questionnaires were returned; whites: 73.3%, South Asians: 52.5% (P = 0.02). White Caucasians' assessment of their own strictness to the gluten-free diet correlated with small bowel histological recovery (OR 10.00, 95% CI 3.2-33.06) and negative endomysial antibodies (OR 34.94, CI 6.58-185.40). This was not seen in the South Asian patients. Amongst the white coeliacs, factors correlating with compliance with a gluten-free diet were: Coeliac Society membership, understanding food labelling, obtaining sufficient gluten-free products, explanation by a physician, and regular dietetic follow-up. These factors were not identified amongst the South Asians, who were less likely to attend dietetic clinics, join the Coeliac Society and be satisfied with information provided by doctors and dieticians. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the South Asians, factors were identified which related to compliance with a gluten-free diet amongst white Caucasian coeliac patients. This study has shown that the treatment approach to ethnic minorities with coeliac disease must be improved.},

Weight, height, bone mineral content, fat mass, fat-free mass (FFM) and bone mineral density were evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. All parameters were lower in group 1A than in group 2A subjects ( p<0.001). After 4 years, the body compartments of group 1B coeliac disease patients normalised, except for weight and FFM which remained lower than in group 2B subjects ( p<0.005). In conclusion, our study demonstrates that adolescence is a period where some parameters of body composition can still be recovered.},

METHODS: Thirty celiac disease patients (17 children, 13 adolescents), on a gluten-free diet, and 23 healthy subjects were studied. Tests of bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (DEXA, Lunar) were performed in all patients and controls. Laboratory analysis of calcium metabolism was performed in all patients. RESULTS: Mean weight and height of adolescents with celiac disease were lower than mean weight and height of controls (p<0.05). Bone mineral density in adolescents with celiac disease was significantly reduced if compared to controls (p=0.015), whereas no significant difference was found among children with celiac disease and controls. The number of adolescents who had started a gluten-free diet after the age of 2 years was higher than in children (p=0.003). Serum levels of ionized calcium, total calcium and parathormone were normal. CONCLUSION: The bone mineral density of adolescents with celiac disease was lower than controls; whereas, no difference was found between the bone mineral density of children with celiac disease and controls.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate both Type 1 and 2 plasma cytokine levels in CD and in CD-IgAD. IL-2, TNF-alpha, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-13 plasma levels were measured both at diagnosis and after a gluten-free diet (GFD) in 32 CD patients, in 27 CD-IgAD patients and in 30 healthy controls. IFN-gamma levels were significantly higher in CD and CD-IgAD than in controls, TNF-alpha displayed significantly higher levels in CD-IgAD when compared both with controls and with CD, and IL-2 was in CD-IgAD significantly increased respect to controls. Kinetics of the Type 1 cytokine plasma levels did not show a clear relationship with the GFD in both groups of CD patients, and particularly in those with IgAD. IL-4 and IL-13, both at diagnosis and after a GFD, were not significantly different in controls and in celiac patients (with and without IgAD). IL-10, whose production is stimulated by the TNF-alpha, had significantly higher plasma levels in CD-IgAD, but not in CD patients, with a significant decrease after a GFD. CD and especially CD-IgAD patients display persistently higher pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, suggesting a persistent state of activation of pro-phlogistic signals in CD, particularly when IgAD coexists. Serial measurement of serum IL-10 may be an adjunctive evaluating criterion in the follow-up of CD-IgAD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are no available data concerning the incidence and the clinical pattern of coeliac disease in immigrant children coming to Italy from developing countries. AIMS: To evaluate the epidemiological and clinical features of coeliac immigrant children coming to Italy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Hospital records of 1917 children diagnosed in 22 Italian Centres from 1999 to 2001 as having coeliac disease were retrospectively reviewed, comparing immigrant patients versus Italian ones. RESULTS: 36/1917 (1.9%) coeliac children were immigrant. This prevalence was similar to that of the immigrant children among the whole paediatric population living in Italy. Prevalence was influenced by geographical factors, being higher in Northern Italy (1.7%) and in Central Italy (2.5%) than in Southern-Insular Italy (1.5%), as consequence of a higher proportion of immigrants in these regions. The native areas of the immigrant children were East Europe (15/36), Northern Africa (14/36), Southern Asia (4/36), West Africa (1/36), East Africa (1/36) and the Middle East (1/36). The clinical spectrum and dietary habits in immigrant patients were similar to those of the Italian children. CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease among the immigrant children coming from developing countries is an emerging problem, and physicians need to be fully aware of it. An important risk factor for coeliac disease in immigrant children appears to be sharing of the same dietary habits with the Italian population. The finding of coeliac disease in children coming from many countries worldwide suggests that coeliac disease is a global public health problem.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Celiac disease is a syndrome characterized by damage of the small intestinal mucosa caused by the gluten fraction of wheat proteins and similar alcohol-soluble proteins (prolamines) of barley and rye in genetically susceptible subjects. The presence of gluten in these subjects leads to a self- perpetuating mucosal damage, and the elimination of gluten results in full mucosal recovery. The clinical manifestations of celiac disease are protean in nature and vary markedly with the age of the patient, the duration and extent of disease, and the presence of extraintestinal pathologic changes. In addition to the classic gastrointestinal form, a variety of other clinical manifestations of the disease have been described, including atypical and asymptomatic forms. Although the typical form of celiac disease, characterized by failure to thrive, is still the most frequent presentation in the pediatric age group, severe growth delay is less commonly seen in developed countries. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent epidemiologic studies suggest that celiac disease-associated growth retardation is becoming a tangible health problem in developing countries, where the problem has been historically overlooked. Given the protean nature of the clinical presentation of celiac disease, the diagnosis is extremely challenging and relies on a sensitive and specific algorithm that allows the identification of different manifestations of the disease. Serologic tests developed in the past decade provide a noninvasive tool for screening individuals at risk for the disease as well as the general population. SUMMARY: The current gold standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease remains histologic confirmation of the intestinal damage in serologically positive individuals. The keystone treatment of celiac disease patients is a lifelong elimination diet in which food products containing gluten are avoided.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory enteropathy resulting from sensitivity to ingested gluten. Neurologic complications are estimated to occur in 10% of affected patients, with ataxia and peripheral neuropathy being the most common problems. The incidence and clinical presentation of patients with CD-associated peripheral neuropathy have not previously been investigated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of CD in patients with neuropathy and to characterize the clinical presentation. METHODS: The records of 20 patients with neuropathy and biopsy-confirmed CD were reviewed. RESULTS: Six of the 20 patients had neuropathic symptoms alone without gastrointestinal involvement, and neuropathic symptoms preceded other CD symptoms in another 3 patients. All patients had burning, tingling, and numbness in their hands and feet, with distal sensory loss, and nine had diffuse paresthesias involving the face, trunk, or lumbosacral region. Only two had weakness. Results of electrophysiologic studies were normal or mildly abnormal in 18 (90%) of the patients. Sural nerve biopsies, obtained from three patients, revealed mild to severe axonopathy. Using the agglutination assay, 13 (65%) of the patients were positive for ganglioside antibodies. Excluding patients who were referred with the diagnosis of celiac neuropathy, CD was seen in approximately 2.5% of all neuropathy patients and in 8% of patients with neuropathy and normal electrophysiologic studies seen at our center. CONCLUSION: CD is commonly associated with sensory neuropathy and should be considered even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is considered to arise from an inappropriate T-cell-mediated immune response against ingested gluten in genetically predisposed people, whereas the T(H)2-type lymphocytes are mostly involved in IgE-mediated reactions. The matter of possible coexistence of T(H)1- and T(H)2-type diseases is still debated. OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to evaluate the allergy prevalence in a large series of adults with untreated celiac disease and their families at the moment of diagnosis. We also evaluated whether 1 year of gluten-free diet had any effect on allergy prevalence in our cohort. METHODS: At the moment of celiac disease diagnosis a standardized questionnaire was administered for detailed information on presence and type of any allergy symptoms in 1044 adult patients with celiac disease, 2752 relatives, and 318 spouses. Those reporting any allergy underwent tests with dosage of serum levels of total IgE and search for serum specific IgE with a standard makeup of 20 antigens and PRICK tests in selected individuals. At follow-up visit patients with celiac disease were administered the same allergy questionnaire. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three patients with celiac disease (16.6%), 523 relative (19%), and 43 spouses (13.5%) had at least 1 allergy (P=not significant). Atopic dermatitis was more frequent in patients with celiac disease (3.8%) and their relatives (2.3%) than in spouses (1.3%). The presence of allergy in general and atopic dermatitis was not affected by presence of overt malabsorption or duration of undiagnosed disease. Follow-up data showed no change in allergy prevalence in the cohort examined. CONCLUSION: Allergy prevalence in a large series of patients with celiac disease is not different from that of their relatives and spouses. However, atopic dermatitis was about 3 times more frequent in patients with celiac disease and 2 times more frequent in their relatives than in spouses. One year of gluten-free diet did not change allergy prevalence in the celiac group under investigation.},

New screening methods are increasingly identifying gluten intolerance in individuals previously free from health problems. The often-abrupt major change in diet may adversely affect the patient's quality of life. Our aim was to evaluate self-perceived quality of life in a large cohort of adult celiac patients after at least one year of a gluten-free diet. In all 581 members (410 females) of five regional celiac societies were on a gluten-free regimen for at least one year. In this cross-sectional study, a modified version of the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale was administered to the 581 patients from five Italian regions. Most patients correctly defined celiac disease, and compliance with the gluten-free diet was high, although reporting bias cannot be excluded. Most felt well (83.6% "very well" and "well"); consequently, anxiety and depression scores were low. Happiness also scored low. Most participants did not feel that a gluten-free life differentiated them from the general population. Women and patients diagnosed after 20 years of age had better dietary compliance, but more problems in their social life. Happiness scores were higher in patients diagnosed before 20 years of age. Anxiety and depression were infrequent in this group; however, anxiety was frequently related to feeling different from the general population, and depression to an unsatisfactory sexual life. In conclusion, celiac disease does not appear to be associated to a low level of self-perceived quality of life in members of the Italian Celiac Society.},

A total of 176 patients and 52 age-matched controls underwent a semistructural interview and a neurologic examination. The effect of gluten-free diet was evaluated by comparing the prevalence of signs and symptoms among patients adhering to a gluten-free diet and patients on an unrestricted diet. The occurrence of headache, dysthymia and signs of peripheral neuropathy was significantly higher in patients with celiac disease than in control subjects. Adherence to a strict gluten-free diet was associated with a significant reduction of headache, dysthymia, cramps and weakness, but did not modify the occurrence of paresthesia or hyporeflexia. Neurological signs and symptoms are associated with celiac disease and can be ameliorated by a gluten-free diet.},

The condition, which is exacerbated by wheat, rye, barley and possibly oats, can be treated with a gluten-free diet in which these cereals are omitted. Serological screening, particularly of high-risk groups, with both IgA and IgG based systems can be used to identify cases. Diagnosis depends on the use of a small intestinal biopsy, which reveals the classical changes of loss of the normal villous architecture. Evidence suggests that gluten-sensitive T cells are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Use of in vitro systems has suggested an immunodominant epitope within wheat gliadin, which has been shown to exacerbate the condition in vivo. This information can be used to devise strategies to develop immuno-modulatory peptides and cereals with the baking and nutritional qualities of wheat, rye and barley, but which do not exacerbate the condition.},

The history and epidemiology of this condition are discussed. Diagnosis is based on demonstrating that the characteristic histological abnormalities in the small intestine are dependent on gluten ingestion. Diagnostic pitfalls are discussed. The anti-endomysium and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies are specific and sensitive diagnostic tools. The wide variety of clinical symptoms and presentations are discussed including the associated condition of dermatitis herpetiformis. Failure to respond to a gluten-free diet can represent simple dietary problems, an alternative diagnosis or, occasionally, the development of a serious complication of coeliac disease such as ulcerative jejunitis or enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma. Progress towards the characterization of the toxic epitopes within gluten that exacerbate coeliac disease and our current understanding of the genetics of the disorder are presented.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Oesophagitis and gastro-oesophageal reflux have been implicated recently in the manifestations of coeliac disease. The aim was to investigate this association in a primary-care setting. METHODS: First, the prevalence of coeliac disease was calculated in 1198 adults with oesophagitis, in 2541 adults with reflux symptoms and in 200 adults suffering from dysphagia; 5459 patients with a history consistent with dyspepsia and 709 patients with a suspicion of coeliac disease served as controls. Second, the prevalence of oesophagitis was estimated in 382 untreated and 232 treated coeliac patients; controls here comprised 5404 patients with dyspeptic symptoms and 2525 patients with reflux symptoms. Third, oesophagitis and oesophageal reflux symptoms were investigated before and after a gluten-free diet was followed in 67 adults with coeliac disease. The diagnosis of coeliac disease was based on small-bowel histology; histological exclusion of the disease was unambiguous in all controls. Oesophagitis was identified by endoscopic inspection. RESULTS: Altogether, 0.9% of patients with oesophagitis and 0.6% of those with oesophageal reflux symptoms had coeliac disease. The corresponding percentages were 1.0% in patients with dyspepsia and 12% with suspicion of coeliac disease. The prevalence of oesophagitis was 5.2% in untreated coeliac disease, 5.6% in treated coeliac disease, 7.0% in patients with dyspepsia, and 27% in symptomatic reflux disease. In coeliac patients, the reflux symptoms were mild but nevertheless were alleviated on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the conception that patients with reflux oesophagitis should be screened vigorously for coeliac disease. The association between these two conditions is, at most, weak, but a gluten-free diet may still bring symptomatic relief for reflux symptoms in coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {In celiac disease, the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals, such as wheat, rye, and barley, results in small-bowel mucosal inflammation and villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia. The prevalence of the condition may be as high as 1% in the adult population. The disease can also embrace various extraintestinal manifestations, of which dermatitis herpetiformis is the best known. Earlier, dermatitis herpetiformis was considered a skin disease occurring often concomitantly with celiac disease. At present, a body of evidence shows that dermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease, and affects approximately 25% of patients with celiac disease. Both conditions can appear in the same family and are closely linked to HLA class II locus in chromosome 6; 90% of patients have HLA DQ2 and, almost all the remainder, HLA DQ8. All patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have at least some-degree of mucosal inflammation or lesion consistent with celiac disease. The etiology of celiac disease in not fully understood, but tissue transglutaminase seems to be the predominant autoantigen both in the intestine and the skin. Serum antibodies against tissue transglutaminase can be used in the serologic screening and follow-up of dietary compliance of patients with celiac disease. Gluten-free diet is essential in the treatment of both conditions, and oral dapsone is usually needed in newly detected dermatitis herpetiformis in order to alleviate symptoms. Oral mucosal lesions, alopecia areata, and vitiligo probably occur more frequently in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis than in the general population. By contrast, the reported association of celiac disease with psoriasis seems to be coincidental.},

AIM: The purpose was to estimate a reasonable limit for residual gluten, based on current literature and measurement of gluten in gluten-free products on the market. METHODS: The gluten content of 59 naturally gluten-free and 24 wheat starch-based gluten-free products were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The daily intake of flours was calculated in 76 adults on gluten-free diet, and the intake compared with mucosal histology. RESULTS: A number of both naturally gluten-free (13 of 59) and wheat starch-based gluten-free (11 of 24) products contained gluten from 20 to 200 ppm (=mg/kg). The median daily flour consumption was 80 g (range: 10-300). Within these limits, the long-term mucosal recovery was good. CONCLUSIONS: The threshold for gluten-contamination can safely be set at 100 ppm. Provided that the daily flour intake is even 300 g, a level of 100 ppm results in 30 mg of gluten intake. This has been shown to be safe, when correlated to histology, in clinical and challenge studies. The level can be achieved by the industry, and does not make the diet too cumbersome.},

In the present study, we show that peripheral CD4 T-cells were decreased in children with DS, while mean values of cytotoxic CD8 T-cells were comparable with those from healthy children. Circulating activated (CD3/HLA-DR positive) T-cells were increased and a large proportion of purified T-cells from DS were also positive for APO-I/FAS (CD95) antigen. To further explore the functional status of circulating activated T-cells, enriched CD3 lymphocytes were cultured for 3 h and were tested for positivity to annexin-V (ANX-V) and propidium iodide. T-cells with the early apoptotic phenotype were increased in cell cultures from DS children. Plasma levels of inteleukin-6 (IL-6) were higher in DS children than in healthy children. The incidence of coeliac disease was also increased in this group of children. Most DS children showed increased levels of circulating IgG or IgA specific for gliadin, and their plasma IL-6 levels correlated with those of antigliadin IgG. The number of CD4 circulating cells was very low in DS children with coeliac disease, was low in those with serum antigliadin antibodies and was normal in DS without antigliadin antibodies. An overload of dietary antigens and impaired nutrient absorption secondary to altered functioning of the gastrointestinal mucosa might interfere with normal immune responses by inducing programmed cell death in CD4 T-cells.},

   abstract = {Diabetes-prone BioBreeding (BBdp) rats often present an enteropathy that may precede the onset of autoimmune insulitis. The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of sex, the time course, the strain specificity, the distribution along the intestinal tract and the effect of diet for the changes in the activity of gut invertase, maltase and lactase found in BBdp rats, as compared with both Wistar-Furth (WF) and diabetes-resistant BioBreeding (BBc) rats. These hydrolases were measured, therefore, at day 10, 30, 45, 70, 95 and 120 in three intestinal segments of WF, BBc and BBdp rats fed, after weaning, either a protective hydrolysed casein diet, which decreases the incidence of diabetes in the BBdp rats, or one of two diabetogenic diets (National Toxicology Program; NTP or wheat-gluten-based; WG) [corrected]. Except for a somewhat lower lactase activity in the BBdp rats, no obvious difference in hydrolyase activity between the three strains of rats was observed at day 10. Between days 30 and 120, however, the activity of the hydrolases, especially that of invertase and lactase, was lower in the BBdp rats than in either the WF or BBc rats, at least when considering the animals fed either the NTP or WG diet. These findings support the view that BBdp rats exposed to a diabetogenic diet develop an enteropathy well before the onset of autoimmune insulitis, in a manner somehow comparable with the situation found in some type 1 diabetic patients, in whom coeliac disease may be diagnosed before diabetes onset.},

   abstract = {We have found that jejunal infusions of long-chain fatty acids, linoleic acid (LA) and oleic acid (OA), and gastric infusions of a fatty acid ethyl ester, ethyl oleate (EO), produce long-lasting suppression of total caloric intake. This effect is not seen in response to jejunal infusions of medium-chain fatty acids or medium- or long-chain triglycerides. Multiunit recordings have shown that intestinal infusions of LA or OA strongly activate celiac vagal afferents. Truncal vagotomy (TVX) and selective celiac-branch vagotomy (CVX) are equally effective in attenuating, but not eliminating, suppression of food intake by LA and EO. These outcomes suggest that intraintestinal fatty acids reduce intake by activation of vagal mechanisms, critically involving afferent fibers within the celiac branches, as well as unidentified nonvagal mechanisms. The role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in mediating the activation of celiac vagal afferents is suggested by studies showing that (1) inhibition of food intake by CCK-8 administration is attenuated after CVX but robust after celiac-spared vagotomy (CSV), (2) multiunit activity of celiac vagal afferents is increased by CCK-8 administration, and (3) activation of celiac fibers by intestinal LA infusion is severely attenuated by the CCK(A) antagonist lorglumide.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease may manifest with a variety of symptoms which can result in delays in diagnosis. Celiac disease is associated with a number of other medical conditions. The last national survey of members of the Canadian Celiac Association (CCA) was in 1989. Our objective was to determine the feasibility of surveying over 5,000 members of the CCA, in addition to obtaining more health related information about celiac disease. METHODS: The Professional Advisory Board of the CCA in collaboration with the University of Ottawa developed a comprehensive questionnaire on celiac disease. The questionnaire was pre-tested and then a pilot survey was conducted on members of the Ottawa Chapter of the CCA using a Modified Dillmans' Total Design method for mail surveys. RESULTS: We had a 76% response to the first mailout of the questionnaire. The mean age of participants was 55.5 years and the mean age at diagnosis was 45 years. The majority of respondents presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue or weight loss. Prior to diagnosis, 30% of respondents consulted four or more family doctors. Thirty seven percent of individuals were told they had either osteoporosis or osteopenia. Regarding the impact of the gluten-free diet (GFD), 45% of individuals reported that they found following a GFD was very or moderately difficult. The quality of life of individuals with celiac disease was comparable to the mean quality of life of Canadians. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our results, we concluded that a nationwide survey is feasible and this is in progress. Important concerns included delays in the diagnosis of celiac disease and the awareness of associated medical conditions. Other issues include awareness of celiac disease by health professionals and the impact of the GFD on quality of life. These issues will be addressed further in the national survey.},

Our objective was to evaluate citrulline as a marker of severity and extent of villous atrophy in patients without intestinal resection. METHODS: Forty-two patients with celiac disease and 10 patients with non-celiac villous atrophy disease were studied by plasma postabsorptive citrulline and biological dosages, biopsies of proximal (duodenojejunal) small bowel and distal ileum (n = 25), or measurement of vitamin B(12) absorption (n = 4). Nine patients were reevaluated after following a gluten-free diet for 1 year. Controls were 51 healthy subjects and 10 severely malnourished patients with anorexia nervosa with no intestinal mucosal abnormalities. RESULTS: Plasma citrulline concentration was lower (P < 0.001) in patients with villous atrophy (24 +/- 13 micromol/L) than in healthy subjects (40 +/- 10 micromol/L) and patients with anorexia nervosa (39 +/- 9 micromol/L). Three thresholds were individualized: <10 micromol/L for patients with diffuse total villous atrophy (n = 10), 10-20 micromol/L for patients with proximal-only total villous atrophy (n = 12), and 20-30 micromol/L for patients with partial villous atrophy (n = 10). Plasma citrulline concentration was correlated to the severity and extent of villous atrophy (r = 0.81; P < 0.001) and to albuminemia (r = 0.47; P < 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that plasma citrulline concentration was the best biological variable to predict villous atrophy. Following a 1-year gluten-free diet, plasma citrulline concentration increased in histologically responsive (n = 6) but not in unresponsive (n = 3) patients. CONCLUSIONS: In patient villous atrophy diseases, plasma citrulline concentration may prove to be a simple and reliable marker of reduced enterocyte mass.},

In poorly responsive patients diagnosis of refractory sprue can be established after exclusion of a limited number of conditions. Refractory sprue may occur after an initial response to the diet or without evidence of preexisting celiac disease. The detection of aberrant, clonally expanded, intraepithelial lymphocytes has led to better definition and classification of patients with refractory sprue. Only a few series of patients with well-characterized refractory sprue have been reported in the literature. The prognosis is poor, though some patients respond to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. The presence of an aberrant clonal intraepithelial T-cell population has led to the designation of refractory sprue as a cryptic intestinal T-cell lymphoma.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease patients show a number of gastrointestinal motor abnormalities, including a decrease in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure. The prevalence of endoscopic oesophagitis in these subjects however is unknown. AIM: To evaluate whether untreated adult coeliac patients had an increased prevalence of reflux oesophagitis and, if so, to assess whether a gluten free diet exerted any beneficial effect on gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 205 coeliac patients (females/males 153/52, median age 32 years) who underwent endoscopy for duodenal biopsy and 400 non-coeliac subjects (females/males 244/156, median age 37 years) referred for endoscopy for upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Each patient was given a questionnaire for evaluation of GORD symptoms prior to and 4-12 months after endoscopy. Coeliac patients were given a gluten free diet. Oesophagitis patients of both groups, following an eight week course of omeprazole, were re-evaluated for GORD symptoms at four month intervals up to one year. Significance of differences was assessed by Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Oesophagitis was present in 39/205 (19%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 13.8-25.0%) coeliac patients and in 32/400 (8%, 95% CI 5.5-11.1%) dyspeptic subjects. At the one year follow up, GORD symptoms relapsed in 10/39 (25.6%, 95% CI 13-42.1%) coeliacs with oesophagitis and in 23/32 (71.8%, 95% CI 53.2-86.2%) non-coeliac subjects with oesophagitis. CONCLUSION: Coeliac patients have a high prevalence of reflux oesophagitis. That a gluten free diet significantly decreased the relapse rate of GORD symptoms suggests that coeliac disease may represent a risk factor for development of reflux oesophagitis.},

   abstract = {Superoxide anion (O2*-) production is elevated in the vasculature of hypertensive animals but it is not known if O2*- production is also elevated in the sympathetic nervous system. We measured O2*- levels in prevertebral sympathetic ganglia of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats using the dihydroethidine (DHE) fluorescence method. O2*- was elevated in ganglia from DOCA-salt rats compared with normotensive sham rats. Treatment of ganglia with endothelin (ET)-1 (3x10(-8) mol/L) resulted in a 200% increase in fluorescence intensity in neurons, which was attenuated by the ET(B) receptor antagonist BQ788 (10(-7) mol/L). ET-1 also increased the O2*- induced fluorescence in dissociated sympathetic neurons and PC-12 cells via activation of ET(B) receptors, but not ET(A) receptors. To evaluate whether elevated ET-1 levels in the ganglia might contribute to the elevated O2*- found in ganglia we measured the amount of ET-1 using an ELISA assay. ET-1 levels in sham rat celiac ganglia were 695.6+/-40.9 picogram per gram; they were not different than ET-1 levels in ganglia from DOCA-salt rats. We then compared ET(B) receptor levels in ganglia from sham and DOCA-salt animals. ET(B) receptor mRNA levels were 32% higher and ET(B) receptor protein levels were 20% higher in celiac ganglia from DOCA-salt rats than from sham rats separately. In conclusion, O2*- is elevated in prevertebral sympathetic ganglia in DOCA-salt hypertension, and ET-1 is a potent stimulus for the elevation of O2*- levels in sympathetic ganglia, an effect that may be mediated by the upregulation of ET(B) receptors.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gut functional diseases, affecting 10-20% of people worldwide. Although most patients do not seek medical help, the disease accounts for huge costs for both patients and health-care systems and worsens significantly patients' quality of life. Diagnosis is based on the identification of symptoms according to Manning, Rome I and Rome II criteria and exclusion of alarm indicators. IBS symptoms overlap with those of coeliac disease, lactose intolerance, food allergies and bile salt malabsorption. The treatment of IBS is centred on an excellent doctor-patient relationship along with drugs targeting the predominant symptom, especially during exacerbations. Current pharmacological remedies are unsatisfactory due to the high number of patients complaining of lack of response and/or symptom recurrence. Although useful in some IBS patients, the validity of psychotherapy deserves further investigation. A wide array of potentially useful drugs are currently under consideration in pre-clinical trials. A better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying IBS may help to develop more effective drugs for this disease.},

Twenty-nine adult patients with celiac disease and 47 matched healthy comparison subjects participated in the study. More than 70% of the celiac disease group scored in the pathological range on at least one scale of the Illness Behavior Questionnaire. Patients who received the diagnosis in adulthood had a lower score for nonconformism, a greater tendency to pretend to be sociable, and higher levels of psychophysiological reactiveness, relative to the comparison subjects. The results suggest that celiac disease may be associated with changes in personality that may interfere with patients' adaptation to living with a chronic disease.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is usually revealed by intestinal symptoms, but less frequently by deficiency symptoms. Early screening is very important to avoid with appropriate diet an intestinal lymphoma or epidermoid cancer. We report here the case of a 68-year old woman where coeliac disease was pointed out by very long Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT). Clinical examination was strictly normal except for leanness, a small height, and several diarrhoea episodes 3 or 4 times a year. Other blood tests showed a macrocytic anemia, a fibrinogen level slightly above the upper limit, a decreased proteinaemia and albuminaemia, and a sideraemia at the lower normal limit. Liver tests pointed to a cytolysis. Vitamin K-dependent factors were decreased. A perfusion of vitamin-K allowed getting a normal PT. Duodenofiberscopy with biopsy allowed the diagnosis of coeliac disease. Neither lymphoma nor epidermoid cancer were detected. A gluten-free diet allowed the disappearing of digestive symptoms, weight rising and return to a normal PT. Searching for a coeliac disease is therefore relevant in aged patients even when very faint clinical or biological symptoms of malabsorption appear, particularly when PT is longer than the control with decreased vitamin-K dependant factors.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review current understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of celiac disease. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Few recent randomized controlled trials (level I evidence) have studied treatments for celiac disease. There are recent comparative studies (level II evidence) and there is well established consensus (level III evidence) on diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease. MAIN MESSAGE: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated small bowel enteropathy caused by exposure to wheat gluten protein. The disease can be insidious and often presents with only subtle extraintestinal manifestations in a variety of organ systems. Recent epidemiologic surveys suggest celiac disease is much more common in North America than previously thought. Advances in immunology and screening have made diagnosis more reliable than in the past. Removing gluten from the diet is effective in most cases. CONCLUSION: Celiac disease manifests subtly and is an easy diagnosis to miss. Good laboratory screening tests and effective treatment are available. Family practitioners should consider celiac disease in patients who present with confounding symptoms.},

In this study we sought to determine whether the unknown source of the fermented substrates is endogenous glycoproteins shed or exuded through the damaged mucosa. To test the role of nonabsorbable exogenous substrates, we subjected 39 untreated and 23 treated CD patients and 37 healthy volunteers to the H(2) breath test after administration of lactulose after both an unrestricted and a restricted pretest meal. To test the relevance of endogenous substrates, we measured breath H(2) excretion during a 9-hour fast and after the administration of lactulose solution. To determine whether the luminal content of CD patients contains an increased amount of fermentable substrates, we incubated samples of jejunal juice from 7 untreated CD patients, 6 healthy volunteers, and 6 dyspeptic patients in vitro with a fecal homogenate obtained from a healthy H(2)-producer volunteer and measured the cumulative H(2) production. Untreated CD patients showed higher FBH levels than did treated patients and healthy volunteers. Only in untreated CD did FBH levels show no difference if a restricted or an unrestricted dinner was eaten the evening before the test. Nine-hour FBH levels were significantly higher in untreated CD than in healthy volunteers, whereas no difference was found after administration of lactulose. In vitro H(2) production was significantly higher in untreated CD patients than in controls. Increased FBH levels in CD do not depend on fermentation of malabsorbed exogenous substrates; endogenous substrates are increased in the lumens of CD patients and may be responsible for increased FBH levels.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a complex autoimmune disease which is characterized by a strong genetic association (HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8), gluten as nutritional etiological factor, and the enzyme tissue transglutaminase as endomysial autoantigen. Patients develop highly predictive IgA autoantibodies to tTG. Certain gluten peptides are presented by the disease-associated HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules leading to stimulation of gluten-specific T cells. This immune response which is driven in the lamina propria causes the mucosal transformation characteristic for celiac disease. Increased intestinal expression of tTG in patients with CD appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of CD. Thus, modification of gluten peptides by tTG, especially deamidation of certain glutamine residues, can enhance their binding to HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 and potentiate T cell stimulation. Furthermore, tTG-catalyzed cross-linking and consequent haptenization of gluten with extracellular matrix proteins allows for storage and extended availability of gluten in the mucosa. New therapeutic approaches aim at proteolytic destruction of immunodominant gliadin peptides that are resistant to intestinal enzymes by bacterial prolyl endopeptidases, the inhibition of tTG activity with highly specific enzyme inhibitors or at HLA-DQ2/DQ8 blocking peptide analogues.},

This study was performed to determine the effect of purified autoantibodies on the enzymatic activity of tTG. METHODS: Total IgA and IgG class antibodies and purified anti-tTG autoantibodies were isolated from sera of untreated patients with CD and controls. The inhibitory capacity of the antibodies on tTG activity was checked by a fluorometric assay based on the incorporation of monodansyl cadaverine into casein and by tTG-catalysed cross linking of biotinylated cadaverine to gliadin. RESULTS: The enriched IgA and IgG fractions of five patients with CD and three controls resulted in no significantly different inhibition of enzymatic activity. In contrast, the use of affinity purified anti-tTG autoantibodies of 12 patients with CD led to a dose dependent reduction of tTG activity, compared to control immunoglobulins (n=6). However, the remaining activity was sufficient for cross linking of cadaverine into gliadin, and enzymatic tTG activity was only blocked completely by high concentrations of a monoclonal antibody, which is directed to the active centre of tTG. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a partial inhibitory effect of isolated anti-tTG autoantibodies from patients with CD, residual enzymatic activity remains sufficiently high to cast doubt on their in vivo relevance.},

The neurology of coeliac disease includes disorders of the central nervous system encompassing cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, myoclonus, dementia and multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Peripheral neuropathies, of axonal and demyelinating types, and myopathies have also been reported. The pathomechanisms are more related to immunological-inflammatory processes than to a malresorptive vitamin deficiencies. While CNS symptoms of coeliac disease show a poor response to gluten restriction, peripheral symptoms may respond to elimination of gluten from the diet. There are few reports of a successful corticosteroid treatment in patients showing inflammatory findings in the CSF or bioptic material. Whipple's disease is caused by the gram-positive bacillus Tropheryma whipplei. Patients with a central nervous system manifestation of Whipple's disease may develop a variety of symptoms including dementia, supranuclear gaze palsy, movement disorders, hypothalamic dysfunction and myorhythmia. The CNS-infection is diagnosed by PCR of the CSF. Long-term antibiotic treatment is required, and relapses may occur after withdrawal of antimicrobial therapy. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are complicated by various forms of polyneuropathies, and arterial and venous cerebrovascular diseases. In most cases with neurological complications of inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases an immune mediated inflammatory process is suspected to be the underlying pathomechanism.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The causative molecular pathways underlying the pathogenesis of coeliac disease are poorly understood. To unravel novel aspects of disease pathogenesis, we used microarrays to determine changes in gene expression of duodenal biopsies. METHODS: cDNA microarrays representing 19 200 genes were used to compare gene expression profiles of duodenal biopsies from 15 coeliac disease patients with villous atrophy (Marsh III) and seven control individuals with normal biopsies (Marsh 0). In addition, the specific effect of gluten was studied by comparing the expression profiles of Marsh III lesions of seven patients exposed to gluten with four patients on a gluten free diet. RESULTS: Comparing Marsh III with Marsh 0 lesions identified 109 genes that differed significantly (p<0.001) in expression levels between patients and controls. A large number of these genes have functions in proliferation and differentiation pathways and might be important for correct development of crypt-villous units. Alterations in these pathways may lead to the characteristic hyperplasia and villous atrophy seen in coeliac disease. The analyses also revealed 120 differentially expressed genes (p<0.005) when comparing patients on a gluten free diet with those exposed to gluten. These genes further strengthen our observation of increased cell proliferation in the presence of gluten. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new candidate genes in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease. Based on our results, we hypothesise that villous atrophy in coeliac disease patients is due to failure in cell differentiation. These genes are involved in pathways not previously implicated in coeliac disease pathogenesis and they may provide new targets for therapy.},

If serological screening is positive or if a patient displays suggestive symptoms, an endoscopic biopsy of the distal duodenum is required to confirm the diagnosis. Symptoms of celiac disease are often mild or absent. Overt malabsorption occurs in only 2% to 10% of children. Individuals with a higher risk of developing celiac disease, including first-degree relatives of affected patients and children with type I diabetes, Turner syndrome, Williams syndrome or Down syndrome, should be offered screening for celiac disease along with a discussion of the implications. If serological testing is negative, a high index of suspicion should remain if malabsorption, iron deficiency or osteopenia is present. Also, immunoglobulin A deficiency should be excluded. At-risk individuals should undergo serial serological screening. Lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet is the only treatment. If left untreated, symptomatic children with celiac disease carry an increased risk of developing osteoporosis and have a greater lifetime risk of cancer. The long-term outcome of undiagnosed or untreated asymptomatic individuals is less clear.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the role of autoantibody tests for autoimmune diseases in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Citation lists of included studies were scanned and relevant professional and patient websites reviewed. Laboratories and manufacturers were contacted to identify ongoing or unpublished research. REVIEW METHODS: Following scoping searches on thyroid and coeliac autoantibodies, a systematic review of autoantibody tests for diagnosis of coeliac disease was carried out. Studies were included where cohorts of untreated patients with unknown disease status were included, all patients had undergone the reference test (biopsy) and antibody tests, and sensitivity and specificity were reported or calculable. Selected studies were then evaluated against a quality checklist. Summary statistics of diagnostic accuracy, i.e. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratios, were calculated for all studies. A decision analytic model was developed to evaluate the cost utility of screening for coeliac disease at diagnosis of diabetes. RESULTS: All antibody tests for diagnosis of coeliac disease showed reasonably good diagnostic test accuracy. Studies reported variable measures of test accuracy, which may be due to aspects of study quality, differences in the tests and their execution in the laboratories, different populations and reference standards. The decision analytic model indicated screening for coeliac disease at diagnosis of diabetes was cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses exploring variations in the cost and disutility of gluten-free diet, the utilities attached to treated and untreated coeliac disease and the decrease in life expectancy associated with treated and untreated coeliac disease did substantially affect the cost-effectiveness of the screening strategies considered. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of test accuracy in testing for coeliac disease, immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-endomysium is the most accurate test. If an enzyme-linked immunoassay test was required, which may be more suitable for screening purposes as it can be semi-automated, testing for IgA tissue transglutaminase is likely to be most accurate. The decision analytic model shows that the most accurate tests combined with confirmatory biopsy are the most cost-effective, whilst combinations of tests add little or no further value. There is limited information regarding test accuracy in screening populations with diabetes, and there is some uncertainty over whether the test characteristics would remain the same. Further research is required regarding the role of screening in silent coeliac disease and regarding long-term outcomes and complications of untreated coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lymphocytic gastritis (LG) is defined by the recognition of >25 intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) per 100 surface epithelial cells. Approximately 50% of children with celiac disease (CD) present LG, which mainly involves the gastric antrum and disappears after a gluten-free diet. This intraepithelial population of lymphocytes has not been immunophenotypically characterized for this age group. MATERIAL/METHODS: We immunohistochemically analyzed 5 formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded biopsies of LG in children with untreated celiac disease using a panel of antibodies. All patients were diagnosed on the bases of clinical, laboratory and histopathological data. RESULTS: All showed similar results. IEL proved to be CD45RO, CD3, CD7, CD8, and Tia-1 positive, while CD4, CD20, CD79a, CD56, CD57, granzyme B, perforin, TCR gamma-delta, TCR beta (V-19), CD95 (FAS), CD95-L (FAS-L) and HLA II were negative. Many IEL were in apoptosis. CD45RO, CD3 and CD7 presented as membranous staining, while Tia-1 resulted in intracytoplasmic granular brown dots. In 3 cases there were rare lymphocytes with granzyme B-positive granules localized to the lamina propria. None presented Helicobacter pylori -like organisms at the luminal surface. CONCLUSIONS: LG associated with CD in children contains a peculiar CD8+ intraepithelial T-lymphocyte population which immunohistochemically lacks perforin and granzyme B, undergoes apoptosis, and is not associated with substantial damage to the epithelial cells. Our results fit with those reported in adults except for the negative results for granzyme B. The findings appear disparate from the ones described in the duodeno-jejunal mucosa in untreated celiac disease.},

The majority of people with CD are symptom-free adults; the remainder are prone to a bewildering variety of signs and symptoms, ranging from infertility to type 1 diabetes. Many patients with undiagnosed CD spend years seeking help for complaints such as chronic tiredness or mild abdominal symptoms. In primary care, an appropriate target group to test for CD is people with anaemia (especially women), chronic tiredness, non-specific abdominal symptoms (including so-called "irritable bowel syndrome"), or a family history of CD. The response to an appropriate gluten-free diet is often life-transforming for symptomatic patients. Positive serological tests for CD require confirmation by duodenal biopsy and, if confirmed, referral to a dietitian and a coeliac society, followed by a life-long gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {The management of oestrogen deficiency bone loss needs to include general measures to protect against osteoporosis, the identification and treatment of other reversible causes of bone loss, and the use of proven agents for the treatment of osteoporosis. The general measures include improved physical activity, adequate diet (paying particular attention to calcium and vitamin D), and avoidance of behaviours that promote bone loss, such as smoking and alcohol abuse. The diseases that should be identified, other than estrogen-deficiency, include primary hyperparathyroidism, thyrotoxicosis and celiac disease. The treatments that are proven to prevent fractures in women with estrogen deficiency, include hormone replacement therapy, raloxifene, nasal calcitonin, bisphosphonates, (alendronate and risedronate) and parathyroid hormone. The most appropriate therapy in the younger woman is HRT, although the trial-based evidence that HRT prevents fractures is not strong. There is a wide choice of preparations and the use of continuous combined preparations avoids regular menstrual periods, one of the limitations to the use of HRT. Raloxifene has less effect on bone mineral density than HRT, but a similar effect on vertebral fractures and does not result in menstrual bleeding or increased risk of breast cancer. There is recent evidence suggesting that the beneficial effects on lipids translate into reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Bisphosphonates are the standard treatment for the older woman with osteoporosis. Alendronate has been found to reduce the risk of spine, hip, and wrist fractures and has approval for a once weekly regimen, an approach that appears to prevent GI side effects. Risedronate reduces the risk of spine and non-vertebral fractures within the first year of treatment and has been shown to reduce the risk of hip fracture. It has not been associated with an excess of GI side effects. Parathyroid hormone therapy results in increases in BMD that are even greater than estrogen and the bisphosphonates and to an even greater reduction in the risk of fractures, particularly non-vertebral fractures. It works by stimulation of bone formation rather than by inhibition of bone resorption. However, it has to be given by daily injection. Thus, we have a wide choice of therapies for the woman with osteoporosis due to ovarian failure.},

Its pathogenesis is still not completely clear, but it certainly involves immune-mediated mechanisms. Although a number of studies have been published concerning the role of T cells in inducing intestinal damage, little is known about the early stages in which gliadin (the toxic component of gluten) starts the whole process. In vitro two- and three-dimensional (multicellular spheroid) cell cultures are a simple and useful means of studying the direct cellular effects of gliadin and other "toxic" cereal peptides. Furthermore, in addition to improving our understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms, cell cultures can also be used to test modified peptides that could replace the toxic components present in the foods that celiac patients must avoid.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Apley, working in Bristol, UK, defined recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in 1958. After extensive investigations, he found that 8% of children presenting to his clinic with RAP had an organic pathology. The aims of this study were to identify (1) causes of RAP using modern methodology, (2) factors associated with organic RAP and (3) children with non-organic RAP who fulfill the diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Children, aged over 3 years, presenting with RAP were prospectively recruited to this study. They had a detailed questionnaire completed, a full examination with screening tests (blood for coeliac screen, Helicobacter pylori antibody titre, inflammatory markers, serum amylase, liver function tests, and full blood count, urine and stool analyses and abdominal ultrasonography). Endoscopy and oesophageal pH monitoring were performed if clinically indicated. IBS was diagnosed if the child had no organic pathology and fulfilled the Rome II criteria. Out of 103 children (median age of 10 years, mean 10.04, SD +/-3.44), 31 children (30%) had organic pathologies. Factors associated with organic pain were nocturnal symptoms (P<0.01) and abdominal tenderness (P<0.005) and with non-organic pain were periumbilical locality (P<0.002), pain alleviation on defaecation (P<0.04) and low fibre diet (P<0.005). Of children with non-organic pain, 37/52 (51%) fulfilled the criteria for IBS (36% of the total). CONCLUSION: Of children presenting with recurrent abdominal pain in a hospital setting, 30% have a diagnosable organic aetiology compared to 8% in Apley's time. Irritable bowel syndrome, however, may be the commonest cause of recurrent abdominal pain and should be considered.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) have steatorrhea, in part because of bile acid malabsorption that causes decreased bile acid secretion into the duodenum and consequent fat maldigestion. In SBS patients with colon in continuity, luminal calcium forms calcium fatty acid soaps rather than precipitating as insoluble calcium oxalate. Soluble oxalate is hyperabsorbed by the colon leading to hyperoxaluria and an increased risk for renal calcium oxalate stones and deposits. The authors hypothesized that oral ingestion of conjugated bile acids would increase fat absorption and thereby decrease calcium fatty acid soap formation and oxalate hyperabsorption. METHODS: The effect of conjugated bile acid replacement therapy (9 g/d) on fecal fat excretion and urine oxalate excretion was measured in an appropriate patient, utilizing the metabolic balance technique. The effects of chronic bile acid replacement therapy on oxalate excretion and nutritional status also were measured in a 3-month outpatient study. RESULTS: Natural conjugated bile acid replacement therapy reduced fecal fat excretion from 119 to 79 g/d (Delta40 g/d), and urinary oxalate excretion from 87 to 64 mg/d (966 to 710 micromol/d; Delta23 mg/d). Cholylsarcosine, a synthetic conjugated bile acid, had similar but less powerful effects. During a 3-month outpatient trial of natural conjugated bile acids (9 g/d), urine oxalate decreased to normal levels (27 mg/d) in association with weight gain, decreased hunger, and decreased hyperphagia. CONCLUSION: Conjugated bile acid replacement therapy reduced fecal fat excretion, reduced urinary oxalate excretion, and improved nutritional status in a patient with SBS with colon in continuity, hyperoxaluria, and oxalate nephrolithiasis.},

It has been suggested that accurate information is most likely found on transparent sites and kitemarks are awarded on this basis. This paper examines whether the Internet is a useful resource for people with coeliac disease and whether transparency criteria can be used in identifying accurate sites. METHOD: An evaluation tool was developed using selected transparency criteria and clinical guidelines for accuracy. A total of 63 websites were evaluated. RESULTS: In the study, 66% of the websites scored less than 50% for accuracy. This was primarily because of incomplete information but 15.9% of sites contained inaccuracies. Over 50% of sites scored less than 50% for transparency. No correlation was found between sites that scored highly for accuracy and those that scored highly for transparency. CONCLUSION: There are useful information available for people with coeliac disease but transparency criteria alone cannot be used to identify accurate sites.},

Diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) is one of the most frequent components of APS and is often its first symptom. The frequency of autoimmune pathologies in patients affected by T1DM is proportional to the persistance of ICA. Even in first relatives of these patients, an increase in incidence of latent or manifest autoimmune pathology is noticed. The association of T1DM with autoimmune thyroiditis and celiac disease in a girl from a family affected by high incidence of autoimmune pathology is described. The role of gluten in the pathogenesis of T1DM and some other autoimmune conditions in genetically predisposed subjects. Infact studies are still inadequate for demostrating how a gluten-free diet could delay or mitigate the course of T1DM and of other autoimmune pathologies in genetically predisposed subjects. Nevertheless, it is suggested that gluten could represent a starting or a maintenance factor of autoimmune processes and the risk of autoimmune pathologies is proportional to the duration of the exposure to gluten. A screening for a quick singling out of autoimmune pathologies is suggested for T1DM patients, their first relatives and for subjects affected by other autoimmune diseases or celiac disease.},

AIMS: To estimate the incidence of psychiatric disorders in coeliac disease patients on gluten withdrawal and to evaluate: (1) the psychological weight of a chronic disease that involves a restrictive diet and a limited life style; (2) the acceptance of the disease; (3) the effects of both disease and diet on behaviour and quality of life.

This interview, together with specific psychiatric questionnaires, ruled out axis I or II psychopathological disturbances. RESULTS: The modified Self-rating Depression Scale and State and Trait Anxiety Inventory Y2 scores were significantly higher in both coeliac and diabetic patients than in healthy controls. The duration of gluten restriction was related to significantly higher modified Self-rating Depression Scale scores in patients with a more recent diagnosis. Quality of life was poorer in both coeliac and diabetic patients than in healthy controls and significantly correlated with anxiety. The Illness Behaviour Questionnaire showed a high psychological and somatic perception of illness in both coeliac and diabetic patients. Its subscale scores correlated significantly with anxiety and depression symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In coeliac disease, affective disorders should be ascribed to difficulties in adjusting to the chronic nature of the disease rather than directly to the disease itself, thus giving an indication for preventive liaison psychiatric interventions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to gain insight into the pathogenesis of bone mass loss and weakening affecting patients with celiac disease, according to the new concepts of bone structure/strength and muscle/bone interrelationships. METHODS: We studied serum variables and tomographic indicators of bone structure and strength and regional muscle masses in a series of patients at diagnosis and after 1 yr on a gluten-free diet and in gender- and age-matched controls. RESULTS: At diagnosis, serum levels of calcium and vitamin D were low, and indicators of parathyroid hormone activity and bone formation and resorption were increased. All these parameters were normalized by treatment. Peripheral quantitative CT scans of the distal radius revealed that cortical bone was generally more affected than trabecular bone. The cross-sectional area (CSA) and the volumetric mineral content and density of cortical bone (indicators of cortical tissue mass and mechanical quality), and moments of inertia (CSMI, indicator of the bone architectural design) were in the lower end of normal range in men, and below that in 50% of women. In men, the CSMI/CSA ratio (indicator of the architectural efficiency of distribution of the available cortical tissue) was lower than expected and remained unchanged after treatment. In women, the baseline ratio was normal, but both the ratio and the CSMI were low at diagnosis and normalized after treatment. Both baseline values and the treatment-induced changes of cortical and trabecular bone in the radius and the axis (L3) correlated inversely with serum parathyroid hormone levels. Baseline values or changes in the mineral content of the vertebral bone correlated with the CSA of psoas and spine-extensor muscles. Multiple regression analyses showed that metabolic and mechanical parameters were independent determinants of different aspects of the vertebral bone weakening. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that bone weakening in celiac disease might result from both 1) a metabolic disturbances of bone remodeling affecting trabecular and cortical bone masses and the mechanical quality of the bone material, and 2) a reduction of muscle strength impairing the modeling-dependent optimization of bone architectural design and mass of cortical bone. Dietary treatment seems to correct almost exclusively the metabolically induced disturbances, which were predominant in women.},

The presence of gluten in these patients leads to a self-perpetuating mucosal damage, while the elimination of gluten results in a full mucosal recovery. The prevalence of CD in the general population is between 0.3% and 1%. The clinical manifestation of CD is variable; in addition to the classical gastrointestinal form a variety of other clinical manifestation of the disease have been described, including atypical and asymptomatic form. The diagnosis of CD is still based on the small intestinal biopsy findings, but can be suspected using serological testing, e.g. the antigliadin antibody (AGA), the antiendomysial antibody (EMA) and the anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG). The keystone treatment of CD patients is a life-long gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {We reviewed data on gallbladder motility in obesity, diabetes and coeliac disease. In obesity, a condition characterised by increased risk of gallstone(s), decreased gallbladder motility has heterogeneously been reported as a consequence of the different type of meals used to induce gallbladder contraction, characteristics of the population studied, technique used, and proportion of patients with hyperinsulinaemia. Moreover, recent studies have evaluated the effect of dietary restriction on gallbladder motility in obese patients. A two- to three-fold increase in the risk of cholesterol gallstone(s) has been reported in diabetic patients, mainly in relation to obesity and hypertriglyceridaemia. Furthermore, decreased gallbladder motility has been described and attributed to other factors, including underlying autonomic neuropathy, reduced gallbladder sensitivity to cholecystokinin and/or reduced number of cholecystokinin receptors on the gallbladder wall. Impaired gallbladder motility has been reported also in patients with coeliac disease in relation to reduced secretion of enteric hormones and/or decreased gallbladder sensitivity to them. In particular, untreated coeliacs, when compared to controls, showed low postprandial cholecystokinin and increased fasting somatostatin levels. Interestingly, the correlation between fasting somatostatin levels and gallbladder size has clearly been confirmed in patients affected by somatostatinoma or treated with somatostatin or its analogues. Gallbladder motility can be affected by various clinical conditions, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Peptides from alpha-gliadins have been used to characterise the immunodominant coeliac toxic epitope. A peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 57-73 of A-gliadin causes peripheral blood mononuclear cells from coeliac patients to secrete interferon gamma (IFN-gamma); gluten specific small intestinal T cell clones proliferate in response to peptides corresponding to residues 57-68 and 62-75 of alpha-gliadins. We wished to investigate whether a peptide corresponding to residues 56-75 of alpha-gliadins exacerbates coeliac disease in vivo. METHODS: Four adults with coeliac disease, all of whom were on a gluten free diet, underwent three challenges. Peptic-tryptic gliadin (PTG 1 g) served as a positive control. The test peptide and a negative control peptide were studied on separate occasions. The peptides were instilled into the duodenum and biopsies were taken before the infusion, and two, four, and six hours after commencing the infusions, using a Quinton hydraulic multiple biopsy capsule. Biopsy specimens were assessed blindly for villus height to crypt depth ratio (VH:CD), enterocyte cell height (ECH), and intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) count. We used the Mann-Whitney U test, with 95% confidence intervals, for statistical analysis. RESULTS: VH:CD and ECH fell, and IEL increased significantly 4-6 hours after commencing infusions with both PTG and the test peptide in all subjects. The negative control peptide caused no significant changes to villus morphology, enterocyte height, or IEL count in any patient. CONCLUSION: We have confirmed that the putative immunodominant epitope, a peptide corresponding to residues 56-75 of alpha-gliadins, exacerbates coeliac disease in vivo.},

Although intestinal ulceration, especially in jejunum or ileum is rare, spontaneous free perforation of the intestine developed in 6 patients with established or suspected celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis due to a malignant lymphoma. In 3 cases, perforation developed after celiac disease was diagnosed and compliance with a gluten-free diet was strictly maintained and repeatedly evaluated. In 1 of these cases, refractory celiac disease was defined. In another, free perforation was the presenting manifestation of the lymphoma and this led to a later diagnosis of subsequent biopsy-defined latent celiac disease. In 2 others, celiac disease was suspected but the rapidly deteriorating clinical course prohibited institution of a gluten-free diet. In all patients, the lymphoma involved the jejunum, but in 1 of these, perforation was defined in the colon indicating that any intestinal site may suffer free perforation from lymphoma in celiac disease. This report documents a high mortality for this serious complication in celiac disease, its lack of predictability and the potential for development even with strict compliance to a gluten-free diet.},

Pathologic changes may include severe (flat) or variably severe (mild or moderate) abnormalities. For some disorders, small bowel biopsy findings may be very distinctive and lead to a specific diagnosis. For others, like adult celiac disease, biopsy changes are less specific. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly appreciated that several conditions can produce similar histopathologic changes. Serological assays, including endomysial antibodies and tissue transglutaminase antibodies, may be very useful tools for screening and case finding in clinical practice. However, demonstration of characteristic changes in the small intestinal biopsy is critical, along with a gluten-free diet response.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior case reports have linked celiac disease with collagenous colitis, but serological and retrospective pathologic survey studies of small intestinal biopsies have produced conflicting results. METHODS: In this report, consecutive patients with chronic diarrhea and the initial finding of collagenous colitis were evaluated to determine if occult celiac disease was also present. All 36 patients with no exclusions were offered upper endoscopy and biopsies. If the changes of untreated celiac disease were detected in the small intestinal biopsies, then a gluten-free diet was instituted. Diet response was based on resolution of diarrhea and normalization of repeated small intestinal biopsies. RESULTS: Eight patients, or over 20%, had severely abnormal small bowel biopsy changes characteristic of untreated celiac disease. In some, lymphocytic or collagenous gastritis were also detected with or without celiac disease. All 8 patients were treated with a gluten-free diet alone and, in all, diarrhea improved and small intestinal biopsies normalized. In 5, however, repeated colonic biopsies showed persistent collagen deposits. Autoimmune thyroid disease or neoplastic diseases, like lymphoma known to be associated with celiac disease were also noted in this cohort with collagenous colitis, often in the absence of celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that collagenous colitis may be the presenting clinical and pathologic feature of celiac disease. Diagnosis of collagenous colitis should lead the clinician to consider exclusion of underlying occult celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a small bowel disorder characterized by flattened villi and crypt hyperplasia, often with malabsorption. Improvement occurs with a gluten-free diet. Sensitive and specific assays (eg, immunoglobulin A antibodies to tissue transglutaminase [tTG]) that can be quantified appear to be valuable tools for population screening studies. In addition, their use is expanding widely in the clinical practice arena, being employed as a method of case finding. In this evaluation, clinical use of a commercially available test kit was explored. Of 1330 samples submitted to our hospital laboratory by physicians in British Columbia, Alberta and the Yukon Territory (from 1999 to 2003, inclusive), 96 patients (7%) had increased values (normal range greater than 20 units) and markedly increased levels greater than 100 units were detected in 36 patients (3%). Of these, 14 patients (almost 40%) were referred to gastroenterologists in our hospital and all 14 had small intestinal biopsies. Of these, three patients (more than 20%) did not have celiac disease. Two had normal small bowel biopsies and one had unclassified sprue or 'sprue-like' intestinal disease that failed to respond to a gluten-free diet. The other 11 had biopsy-defined celiac disease. While the tTG assay may be a useful predictor of celiac disease, small intestinal biopsy is still required to confirm the diagnosis. In clinical practice, even strongly positive tTG results are not specific in individual patients, do not necessarily correlate with the degree of severity of biopsy change and, as a result, are also unlikely to be useful for monitoring diet compliance.},

This prompted small bowel biopsies that showed pathological changes of collagenous sprue. An apparent treatment response to a gluten-free diet and prednisone resulted in reduced diarrhea, weight gain and normalization of serum albumin. Later repeated biopsies from multiple small and large bowel sites over a period of over three years, however, showed reversion to normal small intestinal mucosa but persistent collagenous colitis. These results indicate that collagenous inflammatory disease may be a far more extensive process in the gastrointestinal tract than is currently appreciated. Moreover, collagenous colitis may be a clinical signal that occult small intestinal disease is present. Finally, collagenous sprue may, in some instances, be a completely reversible small intestinal disorder.},

   abstract = {The development of autoimmunity to tissue transglutaminase (TGase 2) is a striking feature of coeliac disease, an enteropathy that develops in genetically susceptible individuals upon exposure to dietary gluten. IgA anti-TGase 2 autoantibodies are present in at least 98% of coeliac patients on a gluten-containing diet and provide a valuable tool for the diagnosis of the disorder. During disease development, the formation of TGase 2-gliadin complexes through TGase 2 activity appears to be central for B-cell epitope spreading from gliadin to TGase 2. However, the potential role of an immune response against TGase 2 in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease and for the development of the intestinal lesion remains unclear. Recently, an inhibitory effect of anti-TGase 2 autoantibodies from coeliac patients on TGase 2 activity in vitro has been described. Here, we report that a cellular and humoral response against TGase 2 can be induced in TGase 2 (-/-) and wildtype mice on a C57BL/6 background by s.c. immunization with human recombinant or guinea pig TGase 2 in complete Freund's adjuvant. Immunized wildtype, but not TGase 2 (-/-) mice develop periductal lymphocytic infiltrates in lacrimal glands. Although no intestinal lesions were found, this observation lends support to the concept that the development of autoimmunity against TGase 2 is a pathological event that might ultimately lead to organ damage.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is characterized by increased immunological responsiveness to ingested gliadin in genetically predisposed individuals. This genetic predisposition is not completely defined. A dysregulation of immunoglobulins (Ig) is present in CD: since antiendomysium antibodies (anti-EMA) are of the IgA class. One polymorphic enhancer within the locus control region (LCR) of the immunoglobulin heavy chain cluster at the 3' of the C alpha-1 gene was investigated. The correlation of the penetrance of the four different alleles of the HS1,2-A enhancer of the LCR-1 3' to C alpha-1 in CD patients compared to a control population was analysed. METHODS: A total of 115 consecutive CD outpatients, on a gluten-free diet, and 248 healthy donors, age- and sex-matched, from the same geographical area were enrolled in the study. HS1,2-A allele frequencies were investigated by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The frequency of allele 2 of the enhancer HS1,2-A gene was increased by 30.8% as compared to the control frequency. The frequency of homozygosity for allele 2 was significantly increased in CD patients. Crude odds ratio (OR) showed that those with 2/2 and 2/4 (OR 2.63, P < 0.001 and OR 2.01, P = 0.03) have a significantly higher risk of developing the disease. In contrast, allele 1/2 may represent a protective genetic factor against CD (OR 0.52, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further evidence of a genetic predisposition in CD. Because of the Ig dysregulation in CD, the enhancer HS1,2-A may be involved in the pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {Celiac sprue may be defined as a model autoimmune disease with known trigger (gluten), a tight genetic linkage (with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8) and a specific humoral autoimmune response (autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase, tTG). Gliadin peptides are repeatedly presented to HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 positive cells and induce an immune response in small-intestinal mucosa. tTG is a specific endomysial autoantigen released during cellular stress and by deamidation of gliadin peptides as well as by binding with them facilitates their interaction with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 cells. CS is the consequence of an inappropriate by T-cells mediated immune reaction to gluten. The diagnosis is based on criteria of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition revised in 1990. The availability of sensitive and specific detection methods of serum antibodies to endomysium (AEA) and tTG (AtTGA) was followed by recognition of a broad spectrum of both the clinical presentation and histologic changes of intestinal mucosa in CS. The majority of patients have atypical clinical symptoms. The present prevalence of CS amounts to approximately 1:250. The following forms of CS are distinguished: classic (typical), latent, potential, subclinical, and silent. CS is frequently associated with other diseases and many of them are also of autoimmune origin. Serologic testing is indicated in subjects with atypical symptoms and autoimmune diseases. In cases with distinct suspicion biopsy should be always performed irrespective of the serologic tests. In refractory sprue the cryptic form of enteritis associated T-cell lymphoma should be excluded. Gluten-free diet is the cornerstone of CS therapy. The Alimentary Codex in individual countries admits different amounts of residual gluten in gluten-free products. In future years new basic knowledge as well as practical diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations may be expected.},

   abstract = {Removal of dietary gluten is associated with a lower frequency of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in patients with celiac disease. Therefore, we performed a pilot study in which seven islet-antibody-positive first degree relatives of patients with T1D were placed on a gluten-free diet for 12 months, followed by gluten re-exposure for 12 months, to investigate whether this could reduce levels of circulating autoantibodies. We found that islet autoantibody levels at the end of the gluten-free period were not different to those before the commencement of the diet nor to antibody levels at the end of the gluten re-exposure period. In the present study, we have followed the 7 children formerly placed on a gluten-free diet for the manifestation of T1D for up to 5 years (mean follow-up time after fulfilling inclusion criteria: 4.8 years, SE 0.82 years) and compared them to 30 siblings and offspring of patients with T1D with similar characteristics to the intervention group (mean follow-up time: 5 years, SE 0.62 years). The cumulative 5-year risk of T1D in the intervention group did not differ from that in the prediabetic control group (42.9%, 95 CI (6.3-79.5%) vs. 49.7%, 95 CI (30.9-68.5%), p=0.87, log-rank test). These findings suggest that removing gluten from the diet over a period of one year is effective neither in the short nor in the long term in high-risk prediabetic individuals with a fully activated immune response to different islet antigens close to manifestation of T1D. These and recent data showing that exposure to dietary gluten in offspring of mothers and fathers with T1D very early in life is associated with an increased risk of developing islet antibodies also suggest that removal of dietary gluten should be tested as early as possible in children with an increased risk of islet autoimmunity, i.e. before an immune response to islet antigens is established.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Subclinical celiac disease (CD) has been associated with various neurological disorders, the most common being neuropathy and cerebellar ataxia. The aims of the present study were to assess the following: 1) the prevalence of CD in patients affected by migraine; 2) whether there are regional cerebral blood flow abnormalities in migraine patients with CD compared to migraine patients without CD; and 3) the effects of a gluten free diet in migraine patients with CD. METHODS: A total of 90 patients affected by idiopathic migraine were enrolled, and 236 blood donors were used as controls. Serum IgG antitransglutaminase (TgA) and IgA antiendomysial (EmA) were measured. In positive cases, diagnosis was confirmed endoscopically. A gluten free diet was started in the patients diagnosed with CD, who were followed for 6 months. A single photon emission CT brain study was performed before and after a gluten free diet. RESULTS: Four of 90 (4.4%; 95% CI = 1.2-11.0) migraine patients were found to have CD compared with 0.4% (95% CI = 0.01-2.3) blood donor controls (p < 0.05). During the 6 months of gluten free diet, one of the four patients had no migraine attacks, and the remaining three patients experienced an improvement in frequency, duration, and intensity of migraine. Single photon emission CT studies showed a regional baseline reduction in brain tracer uptake in all four patients. Such reduction in uptake completely resolved at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a significant proportion of patients with migraine may have CD, and that a gluten free diet may lead to a improvement in the migraine in these patients.},

Though it was considered uncommon in India in past, it is being described frequently recently. Some patients with celiac disease do not improve despite gluten free diet (GFD). A study described 15 cases of celiac disease unresponsive to GFD in whom small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) or lactose intolerance was the cause for unresponsiveness. CASE PRESENTATION: During a three-year period, 12 adult patients with celiac disease were seen in the Luminal Gastroenterology Clinic in a tertiary referral center in northern India. Two of these 12 patients (16.6%), who did not fully respond to GFD initially, are presented here. Unresponsiveness resulted from SIBO in one and lactose intolerance in the other. The former patient responded to antibiotics and the latter to lactose withdrawal in addition to standard GFD. CONCLUSION: In patients with celiac disease partially responsive or unresponsive to GFD, SIBO and lactose intolerance should be suspected; appropriate investigations and treatment for these may result in complete recovery.},

In this study, we report recognition of the gliadin-derived peptide (A-gliadin 123-132) by CD8(+) T lymphocytes from celiac patients. A-gliadin 123-132-specific IFN-gamma production and cytotoxic activity were detected in PBMCs derived from patients on gluten-free diet, but not from either celiac patients on gluten-containing diet or healthy controls. In contrast, A-gliadin 123-132-specific cells were isolated from small intestine biopsies of patients on either gluten-free or gluten-containing diets. Short-term T cell lines derived from the small intestinal mucosa and specific for the 123-132 epitope recognized human APC pulsed with either whole recombinant alpha-gliadin or a partial pepsin-trypsin gliadin digest. Finally, we speculate on a possible mechanism leading to processing and presentation of class I-restricted gliadin-derived epitopes in celiac disease patients.},

   abstract = {AIM: Some recent studies showed that alteration of upper-gut motility in coeliac disease may be related to dysfunction of autonomic nervous system. The aim of our study was to investigate whether autonomic nervous system was altered in untreated and unselected coeliac disease patients. METHODS: We studied 8 untreated and consecutive coeliac disease patients (2 males and 6 females, age range 37+/-14.5 years). Histological evaluation of duodenal mucosa, anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA), antiendomysial antibodies (EMA) and anti-tTG antibodies and sorbitol H2 breath test were performed in all patients. Extrinsic autonomic neuropathy was assessed by the standardized measurement of cardiovascular reflexes (lying-to-standing, Valsalva manoeuvre, deep breathing, sustained handgrip). The results obtained were compared with a healthy, asymptomatic control group (6 males and 7 females, age range 42.3+/-13.5 years). RESULTS: Coeliac patients exhibited a lower increase of PAS as a response to isometric effort, a reduction of spectral power LF as a response to clinostatic position, but without statistical significance. Also they showed a lower tolerance to orthostatic position, associated with a latent disequilibrium of sympathetic-vagal balance, a relative prevalence of parasympathetic component of the autonomic function. However, these results were not statistically significant when compared with control group (P = n.s.). And they were unchanged after 6 and 12 mo of gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: This study failed to confirm a significant correlation between autonomic dysfunction and coeliac disease, yet we could not exclude a role of autonomic dysfunction in the genesis of systemic symptoms in some coeliacs.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) is a rare syndrome with a poor prognosis, defined by malabsorption due to gluten-related enteropathy after initial or subsequent failure of a strict gluten-free diet and after exclusion of any disorder mimicking coeliac disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients were included and treated. Based on intraepithelial T-lymphocyte(IEL) phenotyping, patients were recorded as having RCD type I with normal IELs, or RCD type II with phenotypically immature IELs defined by a lack of characteristic T-cell markers. Treatment consisted of azathioprine combined with prednisone for 1 year, which was tapered and, if possible, stopped. RESULTS: Clinical improvement was seen in nearly all patients in both groups. Eight of 10 RCD type I patients responded histologically, and complete normalization of villi was seen in four patients. In RCD type II, 6/8 patients developed enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) and 7/8 patients died. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time we report a promising therapeutic treatment option for RCD type I. In RCD type II, azathioprine and prednisone therapy (APT) is not effective, therefore we suggest that other (chemo)therapeutic agents are considered. Not all RCD type II patients presented with a monoclonal TCRgamma-gene rearrangement and immunohistological changes as is currently reported in the literature. Therefore, immunophenotyping seems mandatory in the work-up of RCD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: 1) The aim of the study was to identify the atypical celiac disease (CD) in a cohort of symptomatic osteoporotic patients, younger than 55 years of age and 2) To study associated clinical and laboratory features and outcome with gluten-free diet. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 33 patients (F:M = 28:5), mean age 29 years (range 15-52 years) with osteoporosis (WHO diagnostic criteria, T-score less than -2.5 on DEXA scan) from January 2000 - June 2002. Serological screening for CD was done by detecting circulating IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase by ELISA. Patients with presence of antibodies to transglutaminase were subjected to biopsy from the 2nd part of the duodenum by upper GI endoscopy. The biopsies were reported independently by two pathologists who were blinded for the serology report. Measurement of mucosal thickness, crypts and villi were done with an ocular micrometer. Other parameters like complete hemogram, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), calcium profile, 25-OH-D, parathyroid hormone (PTH) were evaluated. Assessment of clinical and laboratory parameters was performed within 4-12 weeks of starting gluten-free diet (GFD). RESULTS: Thirteen patients had circulating IgA antibodies to transglutaminase. Intestinal biopsies were performed on 11 patients and were consistent with the diagnosis of CD (total villous atrophy--two, subtotal villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia--nine). Patients with CD had significant anaemia when compared with non-CD osteoporotic patients. Other important observations in these 11 patients were low serum calcium and phosphorus, low 25-OH-D, high PTH. Significant improvement in clinical and laboratory parameters was noted in all patients within 6-12 weeks of starting GFD. CONCLUSION: Symptomatic osteoporotic patients (younger than 55 years of age) especially with associated anaemia should be investigated for CD. Simple measures like omission of wheat from diet (GFD) lead to significant improvement in symptoms within weeks.},

   abstract = {Seven patients (mean age, 37.6 years; 5 women) had several weeks of gluten sensitivity (GS)-like symptoms; 2 had flu-like symptom prodromes. The 7 cases had morphologically similar biopsy specimens; all tissue fragments had uniform injury--increased lymphoplasmacytic lamina propria inflammation, moderate to complete villous flattening, numerous crypt mitoses, and markedly increased villous intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). All patients were diagnosed with GS and prescribed a gluten-free diet; all returned 9 to 38 weeks later questioning their diagnosis because symptoms had resolved substantially or completely. Clinical improvement was unrelated to gluten abstinence or ingestion. Repeated endoscopy and colonoscopy performed 4.1 to 16 months later showed normal mucosa in all 7 patients. Diseases other than GS can cause marked villous flattening and increased villous IELs in adults. The cause of small bowel mucosal injury is unknown. A similar non-GS-associated clinicopathologic complex, assumed to be due to a protracted viral enteritis or slow regression of a virus-induced immune reaction, occurs in children. The temporal aspects of symptom improvement and mucosal restitution in these 7 patients are similar to "acute self-limited colitis." An overly exuberant immune response to an infectious agent is possible.},

   abstract = {Small-bowel biopsies are routinely obtained from adult patients as a screening tool to evaluate the possibility of gluten sensitivity (GS). Previous morphological criteria of GS including completely flattened villi are usually absent. In the context of screening for GS, an altered distribution density pattern of villous intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) is probably the most sensitive morphological feature to suggest the possibility of GS and prompt the initiation of further medical evaluation. Altered villous IEL density distribution is a more sensitive screening feature than villous IEL counts. With increased small-bowel GS screening biopsies, occasional adults without GS with complete villous flattening and numerous villous IELs are encountered. These patients are usually incorrectly diagnosed with GS. However, they do not respond to a gluten-free diet and slowly improve over months.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endomysium antibodies (EMA) do not detect minor dietary transgressions in patients with celiac disease. AIM: To compare the sensitivity and specificity of tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) and endomysium antibodies (EMA) in biopsy proven celiac patients at the time of diagnosis and during gluten free diet (GFD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty three subjects were studied: a) 30 healthy controls; b) 9 cases with cow's milk allergy; c) 24 celiac patients at time of diagnosis; d) 25 celiac patients adhering to the GFD; e) 65 celiac patients with poor/no adhesion to GFD. EMA and tTGA IgA were measured by immunofluorescence and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 97.4% for tTGA, respectively. All patients with cow's milk allergy were EMA (-) and 8 of 9 (88.9%) were tTGA (-). In celiac patients not adhering to the GFD, EMA and tTGA positivity were similar (80% and 81.5%, respectively); 95.4% of the subjects tested positive for at least one of them. All patients adhering to GFD were EMA (-) but tTGA were (+) in 28% of them. CONCLUSIONS: EMA and tTGA have similar sensitivity and specificity at the time of diagnosis of celiac disease. Positive tTGA in 28% of patients that adhered strictly to the GFD and whose EMA were negative suggest that tTGA may be helpful in detecting minor dietary transgressions and should be further evaluated.},

Our aim was to define the prevalence and clinical significance of anti-actin IgA in coeliacs before and after gluten withdrawal. One hundred and two biopsy-proven coeliacs, 95 disease controls and 50 blood donors were studied. Anti-actin IgA were evaluated by different methods: (a) antimicrofilament positivity on HEp-2 cells and on cultured fibroblasts by immunofluorescence; (b) anti-actin positivity by enzyme-linked immuosorbent assay (ELISA); and (c) presence of the tubular/glomerular pattern of anti-smooth muscle antibodies on rat kidney sections by immunofluorescence. Antimicrofilament IgA were present in 27% of coeliacs and in none of the controls. Antimicrofilament antibodies were found in 25 of 54 (46%) coeliacs with severe villous atrophy and in three of 48 (6%) with mild damage (P < 0.0001). In the 20 patients tested, antimicrofilaments IgA disappeared after gluten withdrawal in accordance with histological recovery. Our study shows a significant correlation between antimicrofilament IgA and the severity of intestinal damage in untreated coeliacs. The disappearance of antimicrofilament IgA after gluten withdrawal predicts the normalization of intestinal mucosa and could be considered a useful tool in the follow-up of severe coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Studies from Europe have demonstrated an increased risk of malignancy, especially non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, in patients with celiac disease. However, there are no data on the risk for similar patients in the United States. Our aim was to estimate the risk of malignancy in a cohort of patients with celiac disease compared with the general U.S. population and to determine if a gluten-free diet is protective. METHODS: Patients with celiac disease seen between July 1981 and January 2000 at a referral center were included. Standardized morbidity ratios (SMRs) (ratio of observed to expected) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, using data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. RESULTS: Forty-three (11%) of 381 celiac disease patients had a diagnosis of cancer; 9 were after the diagnosis of celiac disease, 7 were simultaneous (during same month or admission), and 27 were before the diagnosis. The standardized morbidity ratio for all cancers combined was 1.5 (95% CI: 0.3 to 7.5), with significantly increased values for small bowel cancer (SMR = 34; 95% CI: 24 to 42), esophageal cancer (SMR = 12; 95% CI: 6.5 to 21), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SMR = 9.1; 95% CI: 4.7 to 13), and melanoma (SMR = 5.0; 95% CI: 2.1 to 12). Following the diagnosis of celiac disease, patients were at increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma only (SMR = 6.2; 95% CI: 2.9 to 14), despite adherence to a gluten-free diet. The non-Hodgkin's lymphoma included both T-cell and B-cell types and occurred in both gastrointestinal (n = 5) and extraintestinal sites (n = 4). CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with celiac disease, we observed increased risks of small intestinal adenocarcinoma, esophageal cancer, melanoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma persisted despite a gluten-free diet.},

The role of routine small bowel biopsies obtained during endoscopy in the evaluation of IDA is unclear. This study assessed the usefulness of routine small bowel biopsies in patients presenting with IDA. STUDY: Evaluation of 103 consecutive patients with IDA undergoing panendoscopy with routine small bowel biopsies was performed. All patients had a diagnosis of IDA with either a ferritin less than 15 microg/L or iron saturation less than 8%. Celiac disease was defined as total or partial villous atrophy with intraepithelial lymphocytosis, histologically, and a clinical response to gluten free diet. Gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded. RESULTS: Nine patients (8.7%) were diagnosed with celiac disease. Of these patients, endoscopic lesions potentially responsible for IDA were found in 33%. We found no statistically significant difference when comparing reports of diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, aspirin or NSAID use, or menopausal status with celiac disease status. CONCLUSIONS: Routine small bowel biopsies to evaluate for celiac disease are indicated in the evaluation of patients with IDA. The finding of endoscopic lesions that may otherwise explain IDA should not preclude small bowel biopsy.},

MATERIALS & METHODS: 59 patients (40 girls, 19 boys) aged 10-20 years with celiac disease, diagnosed according to ESPGAN criteria were included in the study. Patients were divided in 3 groups: 1--strict gluten free diet, II--not entirely compliant i.e. faults in gluten free diet 1-2 times per week, III--gluten free diet not followed or frequent faults. Daily calcium (Ca) intake and physical activity was assessed. BMD of the lumbar spine L2-L4 was measured by dual-energy-X-ray absorptiometry with LUNAR DPX-IQ. Physical development was assessed by anthropometric measurements: growth and weight. RESULTS: Gluten free diet was strictly followed by 16 (27%) patients (group I), group II consisted of 23 (39%) patients. Diet was not followed by 20 (34%) patients. Thirty five (59%) patients had low Ca intake and they made up the majority of the patients in every group. High physical activity declared 35 (59%) patients. No statistically significant differences in BMD were found between group I and II. BMD was lower in group III in comparison to group I (p = 0.01) and group II (p = 0.003). BMD was higher in patients with high Ca intake (p = 0.002). Physical activity had no significant influence on BMD. There was no statistically significant difference in physical development between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of the patients with celiac disease did not strictly follow gluten free diet. Poor compliance to the diet had no significant influence on physical development. BMD was lower in patients who were not compliant to the gluten free diet, occasional faults in the diet had no influence on the BMD.},

   abstract = {The present study tested the hypothesis that, in normal male rats, chronic changes in salt intake alter the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and the norepinephrine transporter in sympathetic ganglia. Increasing dietary salt (from 0.02% to 1%, 4% or 8% NaCl in rat chow) decreased (p<0.05) the mRNA levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and the norepinephrine transporter in the adrenal gland, superior cervical ganglia and celiac ganglia. In addition, tyrosine hydroxylase and norepinephrine transporter protein levels were decreased (p<0.05) in the adrenal gland. To test the hypothesis that NaCl acts directly on postganglionic neurons to suppress the expression of these proteins, it was determined if increases in NaCl concentrations, of a magnitude achieved during increases in dietary salt in vivo, suppress expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and the norepinephrine transporter in cultured sympathetic neurons in vitro. Increased dietary salt increased plasma NaCl concentrations each by up to 4-6 mEq l(-1) (p<0.05), with the greatest increases occurring at night when the rats consume most of their food. In addition, NaCl added to cultured neurons decreased tyrosine hydroxylase and norepinephrine transporter protein and mRNA levels, and norepinephrine uptake; however, the NaCl concentration increases required were 15-30 mEq l(-1). These data suggest that increased dietary salt can influence the activity of the sympathetic nervous system by suppressing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and the norepinephrine transporter. While increased NaCl levels can act directly on neurons to suppress these proteins, this action may occur in vivo only in severe pathophysiological states, but not during increases in dietary salt without the synergistic effect of other factors.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In western and northern but not southern Europe, the prevalence of coeliac disease among patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is higher than in the general population. We analysed the prevalence of coeliac disease among patients with PBC in Poland, a central European country. METHODS: In 115 patients with PBC, immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against guinea-pig tissue transglutaminase (tTGA), monkey endomysium (EMA) and gliadin (AGA) were determined. In patients positive for tTGA and/or EMA, the DNA typing of HLA-DQB gene and small-bowel biopsy were performed. RESULTS: IgA EMA was found in one patient with PBC (0.9%, 95% CI 0-2.5%). tTGA was detected in seven patients (6%, 95% CI 1.8-10.3%). Small-bowel biopsy showed flat mucosa in one subject, who was EMA positive/tTGA negative/AGA negative, and normal histology in four tTGA-positive/EMA-negative patients. In the latter four patients, the positive tTGA result was caused by IgA reactivity to proteins other than transglutaminase. Prevalence of coeliac disease in our 115 patients with PBC was 0.9% (95% CI 0-1.9%). In one patient with silent coeliac disease presenting with the HLA-DQ2 allele, introduction of a gluten-free diet was followed by improvement in liver function tests, improvement in histology of the distal duodenum, and disappearance of EMA. CONCLUSIONS: Our results from Poland do not confirm a high prevalence of coeliac disease in PBC patients. Guinea-pig liver transglutaminase immunolinked assay cannot be used as a screening test for coeliac disease in PBC patients. A gluten-free diet may be helpful in restoration of liver function in patients with such an association.},

CONCLUSIONS: The immunological profile of IgA deficiency and/or raised double stranded DNA in the absence of antinuclear factor together with raised inflammatory markers and symptoms suggestive of an immune diathesis should alert the physician to the possibility of gluten sensitivity. The presence of an enteropathy is no longer a prerequisite for the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity, which can solely present with extraintestinal symptoms and signs. Knowledge of the diverse manifestations of gluten sensitivity is essential in avoiding such misdiagnosis.},

   abstract = {Women with long-standing coeliac disease express poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than men do for unclear reasons. This led us to explore differences in their understanding of HRQoL using a phenomenographic approach. We interviewed 10 coeliac subjects (mean age 57 years, range 35-73) who had been on a gluten-free diet for 10 years and had scored either high or low in the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) General Health and Vitality scales. Three dimensions were revealed that pertained to their perception of HRQoL: bodily sensations, social consequences and coping strategies. Within these, the women experienced more bowel symptoms than men did, despite keeping to a strict diet. This item was the only one predicting the SF-36 scores. The women also described more distress caused by the restrictions in daily life, closely related to their controlling of food contents. The coeliac men took advantage of using a problem-oriented coping approach while the women seeking an emotionally oriented strategy showed less satisfaction with the outcome. We conclude that the intriguing difference in HRQoL between coeliac men and women may have some of its origin in the way living with the disorder is conceptualized and coped with. The results imply that in the management of coeliac patients, gender-related aspects need to be taken into account to improve treatment outcome.},

ANSWER: A woman with celiac disease must supplement her diet with multivitamins, including folic acid. Most prenatal vitamins contain 0.8 to 0.9 mg of folic acid, double the amount recommended by Health Canada for prevention of neural tube defects. Without supplementation (eg, undiagnosed pregnancy), women with celiac disease might not take in enough folate to maintain protective levels.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Osteoporosis is the most common manifestation of untreated celiac disease (CD). Bone quantitative ultrasound (QUS) has recently emerged as a new modality for bone status assessment. We evaluated bone status in children with CD using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and quantitative ultrasound. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 41 children (13 girls, 28 boys) aged 11.2 +/- 3.6 years with CD. All children had been diagnosed with CD for at least 1 year (mean, 5.7 +/- 4.3 years). The results of lumbar spine bone mineral density assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and the measurements of the velocity of ultrasound wave (at distal radius and midshaft tibia sites), expressed as speed of sound in m/s, were compared between children adherent to gluten-free diet (GFD) and non-compliant children. RESULTS: Speed of sound z-scores at tibia were below -2 SD in 20 of 41 children (49%), whereas lumbar spine bone mineral density z-scores were below -2 SD in 4 of 41 (10%) children with CD (P = 0.0002). Only 19 of 41 children were strictly compliant to GFD. The prevalence of tibia speed of sound z-scores <-2 SD was significantly higher in non-compliant children (15 of 22, 68%) compared with children on GFD (5 of 19, 26%), (P = 0.01). Children non-compliant with GFD had significantly worse tibia speed of sound z-scores (-2.3 +/- 1.8, mean +/- SD) compared with children on GFD (-1.2 +/- 1.5, mean +/- SD) (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Children with CD on a gluten-containing diet had higher prevalence of abnormal tibia bone SOS and lower z-scores compared with children on a GFD. These differences were not detected by spinal dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry or radius speed of sound. The value of quantitative ultrasound for screening and follow-up of children with CD should be further evaluated.},

In biochemical and cell-based assays, the best of these inhibitors, Ac-PQP-(DON)-LPF-NH(2), was considerably more potent and selective than other TG2 inhibitors reported to date.

For control of gliadin in gluten-free food sensitive assay techniques are necessary. We developed an immunopolymerase chain reaction (iPCR) assay for gliadin. In this technique immunological detection of gliadin by a monoclonal antibody R5 conjugated with an oligonucleotide is amplified by PCR. For quantification, iPCR was performed as real-time PCR (real-time iPCR) in one step. By means of real-time iPCR, the sensitivity of gliadin analysis was increased more than 30-fold above the level reached by enzyme immunoassay. Real time-iPCR using R5 directly conjugated with oligonucleotide was clearly more sensitive than real time-iPCR applying sequentially biotinylated R5, streptavidin, and biotinylated oligonucleotide. With directly conjugated R5 gliadin was detected at a concentration as low as 0.16 ng/mL corresponding to 16 microg gliadin/100 g food or 0.16 ppm (corresponding to 0.25 g of food extracted in 10 mL of solvent and 25-fold dilution of the extract prior to analysis). This is the first report applying the highly sensitive technique of iPCR for gliadin analysis. Furthermore, this is the first approach to perform real-time iPCR in one step without changing the reaction vessels after enzyme immunoassay for subsequent PCR analysis thus minimizing risks of contamination and loss of sensitivity.},

OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of T1D in patients with DH and their first-degree relatives, and to study how DH patients with associated T1D respond to a gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment. METHODS: A series of 1104 consecutive patients with DH was recorded and a specific questionnaire sent to 341 of these for familial disease surveillance. Sex- and age-matched patients with isolated DH served as controls in the diet treatment analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-five (2.3%) patients with DH were affected by T1D and three (3.0%) of their first-degree relatives also were affected by T1D, the frequencies being significantly higher than in the general population. Most DH patients with T1D and with isolated DH could adhere strictly to the GFD. The response was good or moderate in 84% of the DH patients with T1D and in 94% of the patients with isolated DH. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of T1D is increased in patients with DH and their first-degree relatives. The rash in DH patients with T1D responds to a GFD in a way similar to that seen in patients with isolated DH.},

An inadequate diet increases the risk for long-term complications. Coeliac patients often have great difficulty in maintaining a strictly GFD. We aimed to study whether young adults with CD diagnosed before the age of 4 years have a better dietary compliance than patients diagnosed later in life. METHOD: Twenty-nine adults with CD diagnosed in childhood were studied. They had had CD for 17-24 (mean 20) years. Their compliance to GFD was assessed using a questionnaire and serological markers (IgA and IgG anti-endomysium antibodies and IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies). RESULTS: At least 80% of the coeliac patients who had been diagnosed before the age of 4 years complied with the GFD compared to 36% of the CD patients older than 4 years at diagnosis (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to show that patients with CD diagnosed before 4 years of age keep to a GFD significantly better than patients diagnosed after 4 years. It is thus important to diagnose childhood CD as early as possible in order to minimize the risk for reduced well-being and other potentially serious complications in coeliac individuals on an inadequate diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of coeliac disease (CD) requires lifelong adherence to a strict gluten free diet (GFD) which hitherto has consisted of a diet free of wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Recent studies, mainly in adults, have shown that oats are non-toxic to CD patients. In children, only open studies comprising a small number of patients have been performed. AIM: To determine if children with CD tolerate oats in their GFD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this double blind multicentre study involving eight paediatric clinics, 116 children with newly diagnosed CD were randomised to one of two groups: one group was given a standard GFD (GFD-std) and one group was given a GFD with additional wheat free oat products (GFD-oats). The study period was one year. Small bowel biopsy was performed at the beginning and end of the study. Serum IgA antigliadin, antiendomysium, and antitissue transglutaminase antibodies were monitored at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: Ninety three patients completed the study. Median (range) daily oat intake in the GFD-oats group (n = 42) was 15 (5-40) g at the six month control and 15 (0-43) g at the end of the study. All patients were in clinical remission after the study period. The GFD-oats and GFD-std groups did not differ significantly at the end of the study regarding coeliac serology markers or small bowel mucosal architecture, including numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes. Significantly more children in the youngest age group withdrew. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomised double blind study showing that the addition of moderate amounts of oats to a GFD does not prevent clinical or small bowel mucosal healing, or humoral immunological downregulation in coeliac children. This is in accordance with the findings of studies in adult coeliacs and indicates that oats, added to the otherwise GFD, can be accepted and tolerated by the majority of children with CD.},

In this study we measured the content of antibodies to oat prolamines (avenin) in sera from coeliac children and reference children. METHODS: Crude avenin was prepared by extraction with ethanol and salt-solution and used as antigen in a three-step ELISA. Sera from 81 children, including 34 children with verified coeliac disease, were analysed for both IgA and IgG antibodies to avenin and gliadin. Sera were also incubated with gliadin before exposure to avenin, and vice versa, to assess a possible cross-reaction between the species. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was used as a negative control. RESULTS: Children with coeliac disease on a normal diet had significantly higher levels of antibodies to avenin, both IgG and IgA, than reference children (P < 0.001) and the levels correlated positively with gliadin antibodies, especially of IgA-type (r = 0.798). Both anti-avenin and anti-gliadin antibodies were only absorbed by the corresponding protein. CONCLUSIONS: Children with coeliac disease have antibodies to oat proteins at significantly higher levels than reference children. The absorption test did not indicate a cross-reactivity between the prolamines of wheat and oats. The method will be employed for repeated sampling of anti-avenin antibodies during a prospective interventional study with a gluten-free diet supplemented with oats.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is characterized by life-long gluten intolerance. There are a wide variety of clinical presentations, which range from severe diarrhoea and weight loss to asymptomatic forms. The primary treatment for coeliac disease is the removal of gluten from the diet to prevent both immediate and long-term complications. The case of 16-year-old girl with coeliac disease was presented. At the age of 2 years the patient with impaired growth and abnormal stools was suspected to have coeliac disease. She experienced symptomatic improvement on gluten-free diet, but after 3 years the treatment was discontinued. The patient denied gastrointestinal or skin problems. At the age of 14 years Raynaud's phenomenon was observed for the first time. Two years later episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon involved all fingers and toes. Body mass index (BMI) was 23.8 kg/m2. Levels of free-carnitine, tocopherol, vitamin B12 were below normal limits and homocysteine level was increased. Antiendomysial IgA, antireticulin IgA, antigliadin IgA and IgG antibodies were positive. The duodenal mucosa showed total villous atrophy. Gluten free-diet and multivitamin supplementation provided some benefit in reducing Raynaud's phenomenon. The patient's well being has improved markedly. Atypical coeliac disease is usually seen in adolescents and adults in whom features of overt malabsorption are often absent. In cases of health problems occurring in persons with history of malabsorption syndrome in childhood suspicion of coeliac disease should be heightened and appropriate evaluation undertaken.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is a genetically linked immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing grains food. Deficiencies of trace elements and vitamins may be found in patients with untreated CD. No systematic studies have been carried out on vitamin E status in coeliacs. Tocopherol deficiency is implicated in the biological processes leading to malignant cell transformations, neurological complications, brown bowel syndrome and reproductive disorders. Untreated patients with CD have higher incidences of these disorders than in general population. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate vitamin E status in patients with coeliac disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined retinol plasma level and tocopherol levels both in plasma and in erythrocytes in 18 patients (age: 2-53 years) with active CD and 12 coeliacs (age: 3-36 years) on gluten-free diet without antiendomysium antibodies for at least 2 years. Vitamins were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography according to the procedure of Driskell. RESULTS: In untreated patients levels of plasma tocopherol (13.7 +/-3.8 micromol/L vs. 20 +/-7.1 micromol/L; p<0.02), erythrocytes tocopherol (1.7 +/-0.45 micromol/L vs.2.89 +/-0.52 micromol/L; p<0.001) and ratio of plasma tocopherol to serum total cholesterol (3.36 +/-0.9 micromol/L vs. 4.24 +/-0.85 micromol/L; p<0.02) were significantly lower compared to those on gluten-free diet. In the all patients with active CD, concentrations of tocopherol in erythrocytes were below the norm (N>2.5 micromol/L). In untreated patients vitamin A levels did not achieve a significant difference in comparison with the coeliacs on gluten-free diet (1.75 +/-0.57 micromol/L vs. 1.97 +/-0.72 micromol/L; p>0.05). The lowest levels of tocopherol (in plasma: 5.7 micromol/L, in erythrocytes: 0.74 micromol/L) and retinol (0.8 micromol/L; N>0.7 micromol/L) were detected in the same patient refusing dietetic treatment for more than 10 years. CONCLUSION: The conventional treatment of CD is gluten-free diet, but monitoring of tocopherol concentrations, especially in erythrocytes, and correction of its deficiency may offer some benefit for patients who fail to adhere strictly to a gluten free-diet or newly diagnosed coeliacs.},

Laboratory results showed hypoproteinemia, elevation of liver enzymes, and prolonged prothrombin time. Ultrasound examination proved hepatomegalia with diffusely hyperechogenic liver without central lesion. Computer tomography confirmed hepatomegalia with diffusely hyperechogenic liver and a suspicion of liver steatosis was expressed. Liver biopsy confirmed serious diffuse large droplet steatosis of unclear genesis. Carried out examinations excluded infectious and autoimmune liver diseases, metabolic diseases, and congenital liver diseases (Wilson's disease, porphyria, haemochromatosis etc.). Laboratory results showed gliadin, endomysin, and reticulin antibodies. An enteroscopy picture showed villi decrease. Histology examination of a biopsy specimen confirmed total villi atrophy with non-differentiated enterocytes and round-cell cellulisation of epithelium and proprium. Histology and histochemical findings were distinct proves of coeliac disease. A patient was prescribed a gluten free diet. Her metabolic parameters (normalisation of albumine levels, prothrombine time, and trace elements) and anino transferase levels gradually improved. This case documents development of a serious liver disorder as a result of malnutrition which developed in a young woman as a result of unrecognised coeliac disease.},

To reach maximum adherence to the diet is in some of coeliac patients, especially adults, difficult because it requires distinct changes in eating habits. To diagnose coeliac disease tests of antigliadin and anti-endomysial antibodies in serum are used. Authors monitored levels of antibodies in 32 adults 3, 6, and 12 month after histology validation of coeliac disease and after recommendation of a gluten free diet. The results were compared with data from nutritional history. Maximum adherence to the diet indicated 24 patients (75%), occasional consummation of gluten indicated 6 patients (19%) and more frequent breaking a diet indicated 2 patients (6%). In a group which adhered to the diet the most rapid was a decline in levels of anti-endomysial antibodies, less rapid was a decline in levels of IgA-class antigliadin antibodies, and the least rapid was a decline in levels of IgG-class antigliadin antibodies. In the group with occasional intake of gluten was the decline slower and in the group with frequent dietary mistakes levels of antibodies have not declined at all. Adherence to the diet positively correlated with level of accomplished education of patients. Monitoring of titter kinetics proved to be a good indicator of discipline and cooperation of patients during treatment with gluten free diet.},

   abstract = {A 62-yr-old woman with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism was admitted to our hospital for severe anemia (Hb 5.6 gr/dl) and hypoalbuminemia (3.2 gr/dl). Hypoparathyroidism was diagnosed when she was 33 yr old, because of repeated hypocalcemic tetanic crises, low calcium and high phosphate levels. Since then she has been treated with oral calcium gluconate and calcitriol, with satisfactory clinical balance and normalization of calcium serum levels. After menopause, despite this therapy, the patient still had frequent hypocalcemic tetanic crises, resolving with iv administration, in high doses, of calcium gluconate. The anemia, for which the patient came to our attention, was hypochromic microcytic and in the past she had been treated with iron and transfusion therapy. The patient's recent history also revealed recurrent long lasting episodes of diarrhea, hyporexia and weight loss. The clinical presentation seemed related to a malabsorption syndrome: a celiac disease (CD) diagnosis was confirmed, based upon the finding, at duodenal biopsy, of a severe villous atrophy. A bone mineral density (BMD) evaluation showed a limited reduction of femoral values classified as osteopenia according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Thereafter, the patient was instructed to follow a gluten-free diet which rapidly led to an improvement of the nutritional parameters and to a reduction of calcium and vitamin D requirements. Difficult clinical and metabolic control in hypoparathyroidism patients may suggest the possible co-existence of both endocrine and extra-endocrine autoimmune diseases, such as CD. Moreover, bone density, normally reduced in celiac patients, seems to be preserved (maintained) by the lack of parathyroid secretion.},

It is well known that patients with CD are at great risk of malignant complications, but in patients with CD many other disorders have been recognized. Autoimmunity diseases, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, thyroid diseases, and autoimmune polyglandular syndromes are known to be associated with CD, and they seem to be related to gluten exposure. Growth, bone metabolism, and fertility can be affected in patients with CD, especially if they are not on a gluten-free diet. We review the literature on endocrine aspects of CD, because patients with CD are at great risk of developing endocrine disorders.},

   abstract = {In the mid 1980s the incidence of coeliac disease in Swedish children below 2 years of age increased threefold within a few years, and after a 10-year high incidence period returned equally rapidly to the previous level. Analysing the epidemic with respect to any change in female to male ratio over time, or shift in age at diagnosis, may increase the understanding of coeliac disease aetiology. In a population-based incidence study of childhood coeliac disease, 2151 cases (811 boys/1340 girls) were diagnosed from 1973 to 1997. Incidence rates and relative risks (RRs) were calculated by gender, age at diagnosis and calendar time. Cumulative incidences by age and gender were calculated for different birth cohorts. A twofold higher risk (RR: 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-2.1) for coeliac disease in girls as compared to boys prevailed throughout the epidemic. Further, during the post-epidemic period there was an upward shift in age at diagnosis. So far, however, a majority of the cases diagnosed at older ages belong to birth cohorts of the epidemic period, i.e. cohorts that already had a high coeliac disease risk before 2 years of age. Our results suggest that girls as compared to boys may be genetically more vulnerable to environmental exposures influencing the immunological processes towards coeliac disease. Further, an increased risk for coeliac disease during the first years of life due to, for example, unfavourable infant dietary habits, may result in an increased total childhood risk for coeliac disease. A longer follow-up, even into adulthood, is needed to determine whether or not the lifetime risk has changed.},

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at investigating the possible change in spontaneous GH secretion during a standardised gluten challenge. PATIENTS: Twelve children with previous enteropathy suggesting coeliac disease and a normal pre-challenge biopsy on a gluten-free diet were included; eight of them completed all parts of the study, including repeated 24-h GH sampling. METHODS: At the start and the end of a 5-6 weeks standardised gluten challenge, blood was drawn at a constant rate for 24 h and collected for GH analysis at 20-min intervals. The graph of plotted GH values was analysed by means of a computer program (PULSAR). RESULTS: No significant changes were seen in the measures of maximum GH peak, baseline GH values, area under the curve over the baseline (AUCb), the number of GH peaks or mean GH concentration. GH secretion rate (GHt) increased slightly. None of the characteristics of the 24-h profile was significantly correlated to the change of IGF-I. CONCLUSION: No impaired GH secretion was found. Thus, we speculate that decreased growth rate in celiac disease may not be primarily caused by changes in GH secretion. Instead it may be caused by changed peripheral sensitivity to GH.},

METHODS: The study involved 928 consecutive adult patients undergoing endoscopy undertaken on suspicion of CD or to ascertain the dietary compliance; the control group consisted of 59 adults who underwent endoscopy because of indigestion. Small bowel mucosal morphology, CD3+, alphabeta+, and gammadelta+ IELs were determined. RESULTS: CD was detected in 138 and excluded in 545 adults. CD3+ and gammadelta+ IELs both showed a sensitivity of 93% for CD; specificity was 73% and 88%, respectively. For alphabeta+ cells, the sensitivity was 83% and specificity, 66%. The mucosal morphology recovered on a gluten-free diet and the densities of different IELs, even gammadelta+ cells, decreased. Only the density of gammadelta+ cells remained elevated compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Counting of IELs is recommended in borderline cases where the histology is difficult to interpret. An increase especially in gammadelta+ cells strengthens the probability of CD. However, IELs are not invariably increased in CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It is widely recognized that 'asymptomatic' patients with coeliac disease often feel better after commencing a gluten-free diet. The aim of this study was to determine a measure of the quality of life in patients diagnosed as having coeliac disease detected both by screening and those with typical clinical symptoms. METHODS: Quality of life (QoL) was measured using the SF36 questionnaire. This was completed prospectively by all subjects who agreed to undergo duodenal biopsy as a follow-up to a serological screening programme. Seventeen typical coeliac patients who presented clinically also completed the QoL assessment at diagnosis. Both coeliac groups were compared to healthy controls. SF36 questionnaires and coeliac serology were repeated in coeliac patients after 1 year on a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the eight SF36 parameters when the screen-detected coeliac patients were compared to controls, and at 1 year follow-up compared to their baseline data. Two QoL parameters (general health, vitality) improved significantly in the typical coeliac patients at 1 year follow-up compared to their baseline data. General health with reference to 1 year previously significantly improved in typical coeliac patients (3.8 vs 2.2; P = 0.0004) but not screen-detected coeliac patients (2.9 vs 2.4; P = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life in screen-detected coeliac patients did not differ significantly compared to controls. Two of eight QoL parameters improved significantly in typical coeliac patients compared to baseline data. Dietary gluten exclusion in typical coeliac patients led to a significant improvement in health at 1 year follow-up, in contrast to screen-detected coeliac patients.},

   abstract = {In coeliac disease in the jejunum of a genetically susceptible person wheat gliadin and related prolamins from rye and barley trigger an immunological reaction, which induces small-bowel mucosal transformations, villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. Though CD4+ specific T cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, infiltrating plasma cells and autoantibodies are known to have an effect on the coeliac disease, the pathogenic mechanisms leading to the tissue injury remain to be elucidated. Our aim was to find novel gene transcripts, which might have a role in coeliac disease pathogenesis. The gene expression in duodenal biopsy samples from untreated coeliac patients (n=4), patients on gluten-free diet (n=4) and healthy controls (n=4) was studied by cDNA microarray analysis. The method allows monitoring of the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. Compared to healthy controls, the expression of 156 and 60 genes was changed in untreated and treated coeliac disease, respectively. Between treated and untreated coeliac disease, 98 genes had altered expression. Of the 5184 genes or expressed sequence tags, altogether 263 were affected. Many of these genes are directly or indirectly connected to T-cell activation, B-cell maturation or epithelial cell differentiation. By the microarray method, numerous genes were found to evince altered mRNA expression in coeliac disease. The method holds promise in exploring the pathogenetic mechanisms in the small bowel and may reveal new target genes for the therapy of coeliac disease.},

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and small intestinal biopsy were normal. We discuss the diagnosis with reference to the relevant literature. CONCLUSION: although rare, familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia should be considered among the causes of manifest steatorrhoea in childhood even without evidence of failure to thrive. Dietary restriction of fat and high dose vitamin E supplementation improves quality of life by reducing stool frequency and may prevent or delay neurological complications.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the specificity of increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) with normal villous architecture in small bowel biopsy samples for diagnosis of gluten sensitivity (GS) and its significance in the absence of GS. METHODS: Small bowel biopsy samples from 43 patients with increased IELs and no other pathology were reviewed. Patients with prior diagnosis of GS were excluded. A group of 46 patients with normal duodenal biopsy during the same period served as controls. The clinical records of patients and controls were examined for presenting symptoms, laboratory tests, and final clinicopathological diagnosis. Immunohistochemical characterization of IELs was performed in 13 cases. RESULTS: Four (9.3%) patients had GS based on positive IgA antiendomysial antibodies (n = 3) and favorable response to gluten-free diet (n = 4). One patient (2.2%) had partially treated tropical sprue; six patients (14%) had disorders of immune regulation including Hashimoto's thyroiditis (n = 2) and one case each of Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis; and six patients (14%) were on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In contrast, none of the control subjects had GS (p = 0.05), tropical sprue, or immunoregulatory disorders (p = 0.011), and one (2.2%) was on NSAIDs (p = 0.04). Increased IELs were also observed in Crohn's disease, lymphocytic/collagenous colitis, and bacterial overgrowth, but the association did not reach statistical significance. Histological features (number and distribution of IELs, crypt mitoses) and immunophenotypic analysis of IELs did not reliably distinguish GS-related from non-GS-related causes of increased IELs. CONCLUSIONS: Intraepithelial lymphocytosis in an otherwise normal small bowel biopsy is somewhat nonspecific, but in nearly 10% of cases can be the initial presentation of GS. Therefore all patients with this finding should be investigated for GS. Increased IELs may also be associated with autoimmune disorders and NSAIDs.},

   abstract = {Leucopenia and diarrhoea are the main side effects observed after the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in renal-transplant patients. The mechanism of diarrhoea remains unknown. We report on four cases presenting with severe diarrhoea, which appeared, respectively, at 4, 10, 24, and 66 months after MMF therapy had been started. All patients presented with weight loss and biological signs of malabsorption syndrome. Oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy revealed duodenal villous atrophy, which was confirmed by pathology examination. Anti-endomysium antibodies were negative. In all patients, diarrhoea disappeared within 1 month of MMF withdrawal without a gluten-free diet. A control oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy was performed in one patient 6 months later and was considered normal. None of the patients showed evidence of cytomegalovirus in enterocytes or cytomegalovirus-positive viraemia. In conclusion, villous atrophy induced by MMF might be one of the mechanisms of diarrhoea. It is mandatory to differentiate coeliac disease from MMF-induced villous atrophy because, in the latter case, a gluten-free diet is not required.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of iron supplementation, in addition to gluten free diet (GFD), on hematological profile of children with Celiac Disease (CD). METHODS: Children diagnosed as CD as per modified ESPGAN criteria were prospectively evaluated for their hematological profile at the time of their enrolment and after consuming GFD for at least one year. The results were compared with age and sex matched controls. Evaluation of hematological profile included hemoglobin estimation, complete blood counts, peripheral blood smear examination, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and serum ferritin estimation. All the enrolled cases were given iron supplementation in addition to exclusion of gluten from their diet. Repeat intestinal biopsy was performed in all the cases after completing 1 year on GFD. RESULTS: Twenty one children (mean age 6.67 years, range 4-11 years) diagnosed as CD who completed at least one year of regular follow up on GFD (mean 1.5 years, range 1-2 years) were analysed for their hematological profile at the time of enrolment and after consuming GFD and iron supplementation. At the time of enrolment all the children had hemoglobin level <11 gm%, 78% had microcytic hypochromic anemia and 22% had dimorphic anemia, with lower mean MCV, MCH and serum ferritin levels, and a significantly higher mean TIBC as compared to controls (p<0.001). In the follow up evaluation of these cases on GFD, mean hemoglobin levels were comparable with controls but the cases continued to have lower mean MCV, MCH serum ferritin levels (p<0.05) and higher mean TIBC (p<0.05). Seven children had mild anemia. Serum ferritin levels showed a negative correlation with the grade of villous atrophy and lamina propria infiltrate. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is commonly associated with CD and iron deficiency state continues for a longer time even after excluding gluten from the diet and iron supplementation. Apart from offering them GFD rich in iron, early detection and treatment of IDA and prophylactic iron folic acid supplementation will go a long way to optimize their mental and psychomotor functions.},

Forty-one children with CD, with 20 cases in group 1 (mean age 5.67 +/- 2.14, range 2.5-10.5 years) and 21 cases in group 2 (mean duration of follow-up 2 years, range 1-4 years), and 41 age- and sex-matched controls were studied. Hyperprolactinemia was defined as serum prolactin > 18 ng/ml in males and > 24 ng/ml in females. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopic biopsy was performed in both study groups for initial and follow-up evaluation. Hyperprolactinemia was detected in all the patients of group 1 and one patient of group 2 who had severe villous atrophy. The SPL in group 1 (mean 48.3 +/- 17.4; range 20-90 ng/ml) and group 2 (mean 18.3 +/- 6.9, range 10-39 ng/ml) was significantly higher compared with the controls (mean 9.3 +/- 4.5; range 2.4-20 ng/ml; p < 0.001). Among the patients with CD, mean SPL in group 1 was significantly higher than in group 2 (p < 0.001). In group 1, there was a positive correlation between SPL and duration of symptoms (p = 0.006, r = 0.768) and age of diagnosis (p < 0.001, r = 0.842). A positive correlation also existed in group 2 between SPL and degree of villous atrophy (p < 0.001, r = 0.71) and lamina propria infiltrate (p < 0.001, r = 0.568). Our results suggest that SPL has a significant correlation with activity of CD. Therefore serum prolactin estimation may provide an additional marker of disease activity in CD and may be a more viable option economically.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Osteopenia is a common complication in adults with celiac disease. The effect of a gluten-free diet on bone mineral density is a matter of controversy. The aim of this study was to investigate bone mineral density in children with celiac disease at diagnosis and in patients treated for 1 year. METHODS: Bone mineral density and bone mineral content were measured in 34 children with untreated celiac disease at diagnosis and in 28 patients on a gluten-free diet for 1 year. The results were compared with those of 64 gender- and age-matched healthy control subjects. Serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, 25 -hydroxy vitamin D, and intact parathormone levels were determined in treated and untreated patients. RESULTS: The mean values of bone mineral density and bone mineral content of untreated patients with celiac were significantly lower than the control group (P = 0.006 and P = 0.005, respectively) and treated patients (P = 0.015 and P = 0.011 respectively). Treated patients had mean bone mineral density and bone mineral content values not significantly different from those of healthy control subjects. Minor hypocalcemia was detected in 17.6% of the patients with new diagnoses and 3.6% of the treated patients. Of the untreated patients, 29.4% had high intact parathormone concentrations; in untreated patients, the total was 14.3%. Untreated patients had significantly lower serum calcium and significantly higher intact parathormone levels than did treated patients. The other bone metabolism parameters were similar in the two celiac groups. CONCLUSION: Children with celiac disease are at risk for reduced bone mineral density. A strict gluten-free diet improves bone mineralization, even in 1 year. Early diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease during childhood will protect the patient from osteoporosis.},

Resistive index (RI), pulsatility index (PI) and the percentage differences between measurements were calculated. In fasted dogs, the CA showed significantly (p<0.05) lower resistance than the CMA. With all diets, post-prandial RI and PI values decreased significantly in both vessels (CA: RI=-12-13%; PI=-25-29%; CMA: RI=-13-15%; PI=-27-29% [p<0.05]), and in all cases significantly earlier in the CA than in the CMA (p<0.05). With all diets except high fat the maximum decrease in RI and PI was reached in the CA at 40 min and in the CMA at 60 min. High fat diets were unique in that the maximum decrease in RI and PI in the CMA occurred earlier (at 20 min) and values were slower to return to normal (p<0.05).

Resistive index (RI), pulsatility index (PI), and the percentage differences between these measurements were calculated and compared statistically. The maximal decrease in RI and PI after feeding the regular diet was reached at 40 minutes after ingestion in both vessels (CA: RI = -6%, PI = -23%; CMA: RI = -9%, PI = -30%). After this trough, the resistance in both vessels rose nearly to baseline after 90 minutes (CA: RI = -1%, PI = -13%; CMA: RI = -3%, PI = -14%). When fed an allergen-containing meal the percentage changes at the trough were significantly greater (CA: RI = -10%, PI = -32%; CMA: RI = - 14%, PI = -40 %; p < 0.05) compared to those seen after feeding the maintenance diet. Also, RI and PI values were significantly (P < .05) lower at 90 minutes on days 2 and 4 of the challenge period. During the challenge period, dogs did not show overt signs of gastrointestinal disease. Significant postprandial hemodynamic alterations in response to food allergens in dogs with food hypersensitivities can be shown noninvasively with Doppler ultrasound.},

   abstract = {AIM: Recently, we reported typical endoscopic findings and an increment in gammadelta+ T cells in the foregut among children with food-sensitive enteropathy other than coeliac disease. To find out the extend to which the upregulation of the local immune response might explain gastrointestinal (GI) complaints of the foregut, we sought to examine by the increment in gammadelta+ T cells a I-y consecutive series of children referred for recurrent GI complaints to a tertiary-level hospital. METHODS: A 1-y cohort of 102 children scheduled for gastroduodenoscopy were examined for mucosal histology and the densities of CD3+, alphabeta+ and alphabeta+ T-cell subsets from mid-duodenal specimens. The final diagnostic categories were used in analysing the data. RESULTS: Fifteen subjects showed villous atrophy and a high gammadelta+ T-cell density; the finding being compatible with coeliac disease (CD). At the other extreme, 20 subjects in whom diagnostic GI diseases were ruled out showed low densities and served as controls. The subjects reporting GI symptoms after an open food challenge with milk and/or cereals (n = 18) as well as children remitting with a milk- or cereal-eliminating diet but not responding to a challenge (n = 23) also expressed significantly higher densities of gammadelta+ T cells than the controls. In all, 45 of 102 children could be considered to have an elevated gamma6+ T-cell density as an indication of locally activated immune response. Lack of villous architecture and lymphonodular hyperplasia of the duodenal bulb as an endoscopic finding and atopic dermatitis but not the presence of DQ2 alleles showed a close association with these increased densities. CONCLUSION: Considering that an elevated incidence of gammadelta+ T cells is an indication of mucosal response against luminal antigens, up to half the children with prolonged GI symptoms have immune mediated disorder; CD and food allergy being the most obvious clinical entities.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Children with coeliac disease (CD) have an increased number of chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Whether genetically determined or a secondary phenomenon in CD, chromosome abnormalities may be involved in the predisposition to cancer in CD patients. The aim of the study was to follow a group of children with CD in whom the initial frequency of chromosome aberrations at diagnosis was known and to measure the same variable after a minimum of 2 years on a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes were determined in 17 patients with CD, before and after at least 24 months of a gluten free diet (mean, 33 months), and in 15 healthy children. The differences in the frequency of aberrations were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test. RESULTS: Twelve patients adhered to the diet and had a significantly lower frequency of chromosome aberrations than did 5 patients not following the diet (0.16% v 1.2%; P = 0.03), whereas at presentation there had been no difference (1.54% v 1.2%; P = 0.09). The frequency of aberrations at follow-up in patients who were diet adherent was significantly lower than at presentation (1.54% v 0.16%; P = 0.02) and remained unchanged in patients who were not diet adherent (1.2% v 1.2%; P = 1). After at least 24 months of a gluten-free diet, children with CD did not differ from healthy control subjects (0.16% v 0.27%; P = 0.54), whereas children not following the diet had an increased frequency of aberrations (1.2% v 0.27%; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with CD decreased significantly on a gluten-free diet. We conclude that genomic instability is a secondary phenomenon, possibly caused by chronic intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: IgA serum autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG) have an established diagnostic value in coeliac disease, and high efficacy tests are widely available for their detection. However, serological evaluation of IgA deficient subjects is still difficult. AIMS: To evaluate the diagnostic potential of IgG class anti-tTG autoantibodies measured quantitatively using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) compared with immunofluorescent detection of coeliac autoantibodies. PATIENTS: We tested serum samples from 325 IgA deficient subjects, including 78 patients with coeliac disease, 73 disease controls, and 174 blood donors. METHODS: IgG antibodies against human recombinant tTG were measured with an ELISA. IgG antiendomysium antibodies (EMA) were assayed by indirect immunofluorescence on human jejunum and appendix sections. RESULTS: The IgG anti-tTG ELISA had a sensitivity of 98.7% and a specificity of 98.6%, and the correlation with IgG EMA titres was high (r(s)=0.91). One coeliac patient, initially negative in all autoantibody tests, displayed both IgG anti-tTG antibodies and IgG EMA during later gluten exposure. IgG anti-tTG antibodies and EMA titres showed significant decreases (p<0.001) in treated patients. The frequency of IgG anti-tTG autoantibody positivity was 9.8% among IgA deficient blood donors and 11 of the 12 positive subjects with known HLA-DQ haplotypes carried DQ2 or DQ8 alleles. CONCLUSIONS: IgG anti-tTG and IgG EMA autoantibody tests are highly efficient in detecting coeliac disease in IgA deficient patients. The high prevalence of coeliac antibodies among symptom free IgA deficient blood donors who also carry coeliac-type HLA-DQ genes indicates that all IgA deficient persons should be evaluated for coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease is a gluten-induced small bowel enteropathy. Inflammation is known to be associated with enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production. An increase in urinary nitrate and nitrite (NOx) reflects increased NO production. The urinary NOx:creatinine ratio can be used as an indicator of the endogenous NO production. The aim of the study was to determine whether the urinary NOx:creatinine ratio of celiac disease patients increases during gluten challenge. METHODS: The authors studied 20 patients with unconfirmed celiac disease who had been following a gluten-free diet for at least 1 year. These patients underwent an 80-day gluten challenge. Urinary samples were obtained before and 10, 20, 40, and 80 days after starting the gluten challenge. The Griess reagent method was used for measuring urinary NOx. RESULTS: Gluten challenge confirmed the diagnosis of celiac disease in 15 of 20 patients. The NOx:creatinine ratios (mmol:mmol) of the biopsy-confirmed celiac disease patients were significantly higher than those of the unconfirmed celiac disease patients (0.67 vs. 0.17 on day 10; 0.78 vs. 0.15 on day 20; 0.85 vs. 0.25 on day 40; and 0.85 vs. 0.17 on day 80). CONCLUSIONS: Gluten challenge resulted in an increased urinary NOx:creatinine ratio in patients with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease. The NOx:creatinine ratio could be useful for the serial evaluation of disease activity.},

Seventy-six adult celiac patients were analyzed according to nutritional status and 18 children/adolescents to gluten-free diet adherence. As controls, 84 adults and 22 adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome were used The significant findings were observed as follow: adult celiac patients, irrespective of the nutritional status, were younger than controls, presented delayed menarche, secondary amenorrhea, a higher percentage of spontaneous abortions, anemia and hypoalbuminemia. No differences were observed regarding the number of pregnancies, age at menopause and duration of the reproductive period. After treatment, patients presented with normal pregnancies and one patient presented spontaneous abortion. The adolescents who were not adherent to gluten-free diet presented delayed menarche and secondary amenorrhea. In conclusion, gluten per se could explain the disturbances and malnutrition would worsen the disease in a consequent vicious cycle. Therefore, celiac disease should be included in the screening of reproductive disorders.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were studied and the data were analysed by the Pearson correlation. Seven patients (15%) with normal mucosa were negative for both assays. Forty untreated patients showed 89% agreement between the two serological methods, with all samples (40/40) positive to EmA and 80% (32/40) positive to anti-tTG. Eight positive samples to EmA, that were negative to anti-tTG, presented an increased number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes in the duodenal biopsy and clinical improvement with a gluten-free diet. Partial or total villous atrophy was detected with EmA titres equal to or higher than 1/10. The correlation coefficient between the two serological methods was R=0.797. CONCLUSIONS: Both serological tests correlated very well with histological findings in negative patients and in those with high levels of antibodies. For patients with clinical evidence of CD but with low levels of antibodies, the combination of serological tests and intestinal biopsy is recommended.},

Furthermore, patients diagnosed at open access endoscopy may be mismanaged with incomplete dietary information. The aim of this paper was to evaluate prevalence and incidence in 1996 and 1997 for celiac disease in the Italian Province of Brescia and to obtain information on the extent of underdiagnosis and mismanagement. METHODS: The authors assessed the under diagnosis of celiac disease by relating the number of patients on gluten-free diet at 31 December 1997 (prevalent cases) to the expected number of patients in a population of 1,055,499 assuming 1/200 disease prevalence. Post-diagnosis management was assessed by questionnaire for all incident cases in the hospital practice and in the primary care setting. RESULTS: Five hundred and ninety-four prevalent cases were identified compared with an estimated disease prevalence of 5,000 cases, a figure corresponding to 8/9 under diagnosis. One hundred and thirty-five incident cases during 1996-1997 have been identified. Overall 80% of incident cases were symptomatic, but 40% only with the classical symptoms of malabsorption. Forty-three of the 135 incident cases did not receive appropriate dietary education following diagnosis, a figure corresponding to 1:3 mismanagement, and all of them were diagnosed in the primary care setting at open access endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that under diagnosis of celiac disease in the primary care setting is compounded by disease mismanagement, a finding suggesting the need for increasing awareness not only on the heterogenicity of clinical manifestation but also on the appropriate dietary management of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy where pro-inflammatory cytokines and excess nitric oxide (NO) production can contribute to mucosal damage. NO urinary products are elevated in coeliac children on a gluten diet, but it is not known how rapidly this increase develops after gluten exposure. METHODS: Oral gluten challenge was performed in 25 children whose families kept a daily record of gluten intake and symptoms. Blood was analysed monthly for antigliadin (AGA) and endomysium antibodies (EMA). Urine was analysed every second week for NO products, i.e. the sum of nitrite and nitrate was measured with a colorimetric method. We performed a third biopsy when clinical symptoms indicated a relapse. Median age at the post-challenge biopsy was 3.8 (2.7-8.8) years. RESULTS: Signs of morphological or serological relapse were seen in all children. Mean daily gluten intake was 0.10 (range 0.02-0.26) g/kg bodyweight. Median NO level was doubled and significantly higher after 4 weeks of challenge but not after 2 weeks. EMA, but not AGA levels, correlated positively with NO. Intraepithelial lymphocyte count was significantly higher in the post-challenge biopsy, but did not correlate with the NO levels. CONCLUSIONS: NO products in urine increased during gluten challenge. EMA levels reflected severity of mucosal damage, and NO products reflected the inflammatory response, which was doubled after 4 weeks of challenge. The NO analysis is simple and non-traumatic for the child. It can be performed repeatedly during investigation of children with suspected coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of coeliac disease (CD) in Swedish children has attracted considerable interest over the past few decades, and especially the influence of feeding habits on the increased incidence. A national study has reported a trend towards a decrease in incidence after a change in infant feeding recommendations was introduced in 1996. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in a geographically defined area, the change in incidence with time and the influence of the introduction of antibody analysis. METHODS: Cases of suspected paediatric CD between 1980 and 2003 were studied for prevalence, biopsy findings and antibody analyses. RESULTS: A total of 2029 children were investigated by small intestinal biopsy, yielding 554 CD cases. The area initially showed the same trend as the national study, but the annual incidence rate is now increasing again. Median age at diagnosis has increased significantly since 1997 from less than 2 years of age to above 5 years. Cumulative incidence at 2 years of age is much higher for the birth cohorts 1983-96 than 1980-82 or 1997-2001. Diagnostic accuracy was significantly higher after the introduction of antigliadin (AGA) analysis, and especially after antiendomysium (EMA) analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rate of CD in small children in our region has varied widely over the 24-year period observed. Feeding practice and methods of investigation have changed during this period. The annual incidence rate for the total child population in 2003 was almost equal to the peak value observed in 1994. There were no conclusive results on whether antibody analysis had an influence on diagnostic activity, but this seems to have increased diagnostic accuracy.},

   abstract = {The celiac disease was first described over one hundred years ago. English doctor S. Gee selected a syndrome characterized by growth inhibition, diarrheas and malabsorption disorders among the group of enteropathies in children in 1888. He assumed that the large intestine was affected in such cases. That is the reason why this disease was called celiac affection. C. Herter described a similar disease in 1908 and called it intestinal infantilism. Only as early as in 1950 Dutch pediatrician W. Dicke described the inability to uptake gluten (a component found in some herbs) as an important reason for chronic intestinal disease in children for the first time. Gluten enteropathy, intestinal infantilism, gluten intolerance, idiopathic steatorrhea, non-tropical sprue and Gee-Heubner-Herter disease are synonyms for celiac affection.},

Most responses used three- or five-point Likert scales. They were mailed to members of the Westchester Celiac Sprue Support Group. Of the 274 responses, 253 were usable and were the basis of the compiled results. Seventy-four percent of the respondents were female; 42% were between the ages of 36 and 55 years of age, and 46% were more than 55 years of age. Frequencies and cross-tabulations indicated several areas of negative impact in maintaining a gluten-free diet. They included the difficulties of dining out (86%), travel (82%), and impact on family (67%) and less of a negative impact on career or work (41%). The gluten-free diet impacted various lifestyle aspects of the quality of life for individuals with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of celiac disease requires characteristic histopathologic changes in an intestinal biopsy with clinical improvement in response to a gluten-free diet. Endoscopy with procurement of biopsy specimens is often performed to document response to the diet, but there are little data on the appearance of treated celiac disease. This study examined the endoscopic and histopathologic appearance of the duodenum of patients with celiac disease whose diet was gluten-free. METHODS: A cohort of 39 adult patients (mean age 52 years, range 20-74 years) with biopsy-proven celiac disease was retrospectively reviewed. All had responded clinically to a gluten-free diet that they had maintained for a mean of 8.5 years (range 1-45 years). The endoscopic and histopathologic appearances of the duodenal mucosa were reviewed. Blinded review of the diagnostic (initial) and post-treatment biopsy specimens was also performed to assess response of individual patients to the diet. RESULTS: The endoscopic appearance was normal in 23%, reduced duodenal folds were present in 46%, scalloping of folds in 33%, mucosal fissures in 44%, and nodularity in 33%. There was more than 1 abnormality present in 46%. Histology was normal in only 21%. The remainder had villous atrophy (69% partial, 10% total). Paired (diagnostic and follow-up) biopsy specimens were reviewed blindly for 12 patients. The mean (SD) intraepithelial lymphocyte count fell from 61 (22) to 38 (17) (normal <30 per 100 epithelial cells) and the crypt-to-villous ratio improved although it did not normalize. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a good clinical response, abnormal endoscopic and histopathologic appearances persist in the majority of patients with celiac disease treated with a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Timely diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease is important not only to improve the immediate quality of life of the patient but also to decrease the long-term risks of untreated celiac disease. A large Finnish study showed that the 5-year survival among patients who strictly adhered to a gluten-free diet was similar to that of the general population. Growth and development in infants and children proceed normally with continued gluten avoidance, and in adults many of the disease complications including osteopenia are avoided. However, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, and severe osteopenia, particularly in the setting of secondary hyperparathyroidism, usually persist. Enteropathyassociated T-cell lymphoma is widely recognized as a complication of celiac disease, and gluten restriction has been shown to significantly decrease the risk of this malignancy to the level of the general population. Whether gluten restriction is beneficial or should be recommended for patients with asymptomatic disease remains controversial. However, the available evidence suggests that this treatment is always indicated in patients showing celiac enteropathy, at least to prevent the possible long-term complications of this condition. Despite a dearth of evidence presently to support population-wide screening for celiac disease, patients at high-risk for celiac disease should be screened based on symptoms, family history, and associated conditions, as morbidity from subclinical disease in young patients has been demonstrated.},

Ten-day ad libitum food intake and body weight regain after previous body weight loss (13% of initial body weight) due to restrictive feeding were measured in rats with sham deafferentation (SHAM; n = 6), subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (SDA; n = 7), and SDA plus celiac-superior mesenteric ganglionectomy (SDA/CGX; n = 9). HCA suppressed the 10-day cumulative food intake in all surgical groups and body weight regain in SDA and SDA/CGX groups. Independent of HCA, SDA and SDA/CGX rats consumed less food and gained less weight compared to SHAM rats. These results demonstrate that all vagal afferents from below the diaphragm and vagal efferents of the dorsal trunk as well as splanchnic nerves (afferents and efferents) are not necessary for the feeding-suppressive effect of HCA in this animal model. Vagal afferents, however, appear to play a role in the control of intake when a high-glucose diet is consumed after a period of restrictive feeding.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease also known as gluten-sensitive enteropathy is a complex disorder where genetically susceptible individuals develop in typical cases signs of malabsorption after ingestion of cereals. Malabsorption is due to total or subtotal atrophy of the small intestinal mucosa regressing after adherence to a gluten-free diet. The only effective therapy is life-long strict abstinence from wheat, rye and barley. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: During the last two decades spectrum of clinical features of adult celiac disease has been modified. About 60% of cases are now revealed by extraintestinal manifestations. Moreover, recent studies that used serological methods revealed existence of both latent and silent celiac sprue. The finding of the high frequency of atypical celiac sprue contributed to underestimation of the true prevalence of celiac disease until now, and explained that celiac disease could be unknown for a long time, with increased risk of nutritional deficiencies and malignancy. Concurrently, the finding that celiac disease is primarily associated to a few HLA class II molecules, and recent advent of tissue transglutaminase as the main auto-antigen eliciting anti-endomysial antibodies allowed to propose new pathogenesis hypothesis and efficient screening tests for celiac disease diagnosis. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: New epidemiological data concerning adult celiac disease must incite to a more systematic screening in patients with atypical but evocative features, or in at-risk subjects. Introduction of enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the detection for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies allows to make use of a new available and efficient diagnosis parameter, which could constitute the main screening test in the near future.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is precipitated upon exposure to the dietary wheat gluten. Definitive diagnosis relies on intestinal biopsy and regression of clinical and histological disorders with adherence to a gluten-free diet. Coeliac disease is usually associated with a malabsorption syndrome. However, both atypical and silent clinical forms have been recently described and prevalence of the disease may be under-estimated. Serological tests have been developed in order to select candidates for intestinal biopsy, but these biological parameters are not suitable for screening in the general population. Indeed, antigliadin IgG antibodies have a poor specificity. antigliadin IgA antibodies a poor sensitivity. The detection of antiendomysial IgA antibodies (EmA) by immunofluorescence, although considered as the "gold standard" of serological coeliac disease markers, could not be automated, depends on a subjective fluorescence display, and may be limited by the degree of training of the observer. In year 1997, tissue transglutaminase (tTg) has been identified as the main autoantigen recognized by EmA. On this basis, solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Elisa) have been developed in order to potentially replace the EmA assay. Several commercial kits are now available but their diagnostic performances have not yet been compared. We selected 75 sera, including sera from 26 patients with coeliac disease in order to evaluate five commercial anti-tTG Elisa kits. For all patients, treated or not, detection of anti-tTG antibodies with four of the five tested kits correlates with EmA test. Kits using human tTG have the highest specificity, equivalent to the value of EMA test, and widely better than antigliadin antibodies. Anti-tTG Elisa kits using human tTG may be used as an alternative way to the EmA assay in the next future, and may supplant IgA anti-gliadin antibodies for coeliac disease screening.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Coeliac disease (CD) is known as a lifelong condition of gluten intolerance. In case of some patients, the time after which gluten exposition leads to damage of the small intestinal mucosa may be very long. In addition to the florid form of CD, there are also silent (atypical mono- and oligosymptomatic with typical damage of the small intestinal mucosa) and latent forms (often asymptomatic without clear mucosal changes, antibody titres often normal). Occasionally the development of gluten tolerance is postulated (transient CD). We investigated 47 subjects diagnosed in childhood definitely as CD patients. In the age of 16.3 +/- 4.8 years, the patients started a gluten containing diet. After 6 to 9 months of gluten containing diet a small intestinal biopsy was performed in all patients. Surprisingly we found 11 patients with normal small intestinal mucosa (group 1). The other 36 patients showed a flattened mucosa as expected (group 2). The further development of group 1 was followed. In 9 patients a further biopsy was performed after more than 2 (at maximum after 8.1) years of gluten containing diet. In all patients the morphology of the mucosa was normal. In 7 of 11 cases normal numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes were counted. Only in two patients raised titres of gliadin and endomysium antibodies were found after 4.5 and 15 years of gluten containing diet. In the other 9 patients no increase in antibody titers was found up to 10.3 years. However, in group 1, mucosal lactase activity was decreased as was also the case for group 2. CONCLUSION: A high number of adolescent coeliac patients does not respond or responds only minimally to reintroduction of gluten into the diet over a period longer than two years. These patients should regularly be further controlled serologically.},

   abstract = {Enterostatin, a pentapeptide released from the exocrine pancreas and gastrointestinal tract, selectively inhibits fat intake through activation of an afferent vagal signaling pathway. This study investigated if the effects of enterostatin were mediated through a CCK-dependent pathway. The series of in vivo and in vitro experiments included studies of 1) the feeding effect of peripheral enterostatin on Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats lacking CCK-A receptors, 2) the effect of CCK-8S on the intake of a two-choice high-fat (HF)/low-fat (LF) diet, 3) the effects of peripheral or central injection of the CCK-A receptor antagonist lorglumide on the feeding inhibition induced by either central or peripheral enterostatin, and 4) the ability of enterostatin to displace CCK binding in a 3T3 cell line expressing CCK-A receptor gene and in rat brain sections. The results showed that OLTEF rats did not respond to enterostatin (300 microg/kg ip) in contrast to the 23% reduction in intake of HF diet in Long Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) control rats. CCK (1 microg/kg ip) decreased the intake of the HF diet in a two-choice diet regime with a compensatory increase in intake of the LF diet. Peripheral injection of lorglumide (300 microg/kg) blocked the feeding inhibition induced by either near-celiac arterial or intracerebroventricular enterostatin, whereas intracerebroventricular lorglumide (5 nmol icv) only blocked the response to intracerebroventricular enterostatin but not to arterial enterostatin. Enterostatin did not bind on CCK-A receptors because neither enterostatin nor its analogs VPDPR and beta-casomorphin displaced [3H]L-364,718 from CCK-A receptors expressed in 3T3 cells or the binding of 125I-CCK-8S from rat brain sections. The data suggest that both the peripheral and central responses to enterostatin are mediated through or dependent on peripheral and central CCK-A receptors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Asymptomatic children at risk for celiac disease (CD) and seropositive for immunoglobulin A anti-TG autoantibodies (TGAA) may lack small intestinal mucosal changes characteristic of CD. We have followed a group of children with serial testing for TGAA. METHODS: Subjects were a group of at-risk children comprised of infants expressing HLA-DR3 on newborn screening, those with type 1A diabetes, or a first-degree relative of someone with type 1 diabetes. All children participating in the prospective study for development of CD underwent serial testing for TGAA. Data from clinical evaluation and small intestinal biopsy were compared to the TGAA levels followed over time. RESULTS: In 42 children, serial TGAA determinations while on a gluten-containing diet showed levels fluctuating 10-100-fold over 3-12 months. A TGAA index more than 0.5 had a positive predictive value (PPV) for histologic confirmation of CD of 96% (22/23). A TGAA index above the usual cutoff for positivity (0.05) had a PPV of only 76% (28/37). CONCLUSIONS: In children with TGAA seropositivity, the TGAA level varied over time and a higher titer predicted an abnormal biopsy characteristic of CD. A threshold for biopsy for diagnosis of CD could be set higher for screening-identified cases than for clinically identified cases to decrease the frequency of performing "normal" biopsies.},

SUBJECTS AND METHOD: A questionnaire was administered and a complete biologic study was performed in 184 relatives. When serum CD-related antibodies were detected, relatives were asked to undergo a jejunal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. RESULTS: Thirteen relatives had autoantibodies yet only 4 were diagnosed with CD. The biopsy was suggestive of CD in 3 relatives who underwent it. A further relative was diagnosed with CD by the clinical and serological response to a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence found in our study is high enough so that we recommend the screening of autoantibodies, especially anti-gliadin and anti-transglutaminase antibodies, in this risk-population of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the incidence rate of diagnosed coeliac disease among the paediatric population in the province of Caceres and the changes over the years. METHODS: The incidence rate of diagnosed coeliac disease between the years 1981 and 1999, age at diagnosis and clinical presentation form were investigated. The study was carried out over two periods: A (1981 to 1990) and B (1991 to 1999). RESULTS: The incidence rate for period A was 6.87/100,000 (CI 95%: 5.26-8.83) and for period B 16.04/100,000 (CI 95%: 12.99-19.59) (p < 0.0001). The relative risk of receiving a diagnosis of coeliac disease during the first four years of life was 2.31% (CI 95%:1.61-3.31) greater in period B than in period A. The mean age at diagnosis was 37.4 +/- 47.4 mo and 43.9 +/- 43.7 mo in A and B, respectively (p = 0.0058). The typical clinical pattern was the most frequent (83.6% in A and 58.3% in B). The mean age of introduction of gluten to the diet was 4.6 +/- 2.0 mo and 6.9 +/- 1.7 mo, for period A and B, respectively (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of coeliac disease has increased during the two periods studied. In recent years, the relative risk of receiving a diagnosis of coeliac disease during the first four years of life has increased. The atypical clinical presentation has also increased, although the typical clinical form is still the most frequent in younger children.},

Diet therapy allows the intestinal mucosa to recover, improves nutrient malabsorption, osteoporosis and a weakened general condition. A gluten-free diet is without wheat, rye and barley and related products. Oats tested free of contamination by other cereals has recently been allowed for adult coeliac patients, but concern still remains regarding its general safety. Gluten-free flour mixes contain more starch and less proteins, vitamins, minerals and fibre compared to regular flour. Recently some questions have been raised as to the nutritional quality of the gluten-free diet. Successful therapy with gluten-free diet requires motivation and dietary counselling, including knowledge of the nutritional value of foods, labelling of prepackaged foods and practical training in cooking. The local chapters of the Norwegian Coeliac Society are active partners, as are the clinical nutritionists that work in most major hospitals. The physician making the diagnosis has a duty to see to it that all coeliac patients get adequate dietary counselling and management.},

We sought further data from the clinical setting with regards to oats consumption by coeliac patients. Several oat products were tested for wheat contamination using a commercial enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) kit, and six samples were examined by an ELISA using a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies, mass spectrometry, and western blot analysis. Nineteen adult CD patients on a gluten free diet were challenged with 50 g of oats per day for 12 weeks. Serological testing and gastroduodenoscopy was performed before and after the challenge. Biopsies were scored histologically and levels of mRNA specific for interferon gamma were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Oats were well tolerated by most patients but several reported initial abdominal discomfort and bloating. One of the patients developed partial villous atrophy and a rash during the first oats challenge. She subsequently improved on an oats free diet but developed subtotal villous atrophy and dramatic dermatitis during a second challenge. Five of the patients showed positive levels of interferon gamma mRNA after challenge. Some concerns therefore remain with respect to the safety of oats for coeliacs.},

However, it remains obscure whether there are signs of clinical or subclinical nervous system involvement even in patients adopting an adequate gluten free diet. The aim of this study was to assess in a controlled study whether patients with treated coeliac disease carry an increased risk for neuropathy and characterise the type of possible neuropathy. METHODS: Electroneuromyographic findings and vibration, thermal, and tactile thresholds of 26 patients with coeliac disease and 23 patients with reflux disease were analysed. RESULTS: Six (23.1 %) coeliac disease patients and one (4.3 %) reflux disease patient showed findings of chronic axonal neuropathy in quantitative needle EMG. In addition, two coeliac disease patients showed findings suggestive for myopathy. There were no significant differences in warm, cold, or vibration thresholds between the groups but means of heat pain thresholds and tactile thresholds were significantly higher in coeliac patients than in controls. CONCLUSION: An increased occurrence of axonal neuropathy was observed in well treated coeliac disease. This further indicates that neurological manifestations occur even in patients without overt malabsorption.},

AIMS: To establish whether splanchnic haemodynamics can be modified by a gluten-free diet. PATIENTS: Ten coeliac patients and 10 paired healthy subjects. METHODS: Echo-Doppler measurements were made of splanchnic vessels both fasting and after a standard meal before and after 9 months of a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: In comparison to controls, coeliac patients had higher superior mesenteric artery blood velocity and flow, with lower resistance indexes and higher portal vein velocity and flow, particularly 3 h after a meal. Postprandial hyperaemia was reduced and delayed in time. Intrasplenic resistance indexes were also significantly lower both fasting and after a meal. After 9 months of a gluten-free diet, no significant differences were observed between coeliac patients and controls, both fasting and after a meal. CONCLUSIONS: Splanchnic haemodynamics is significantly changed in coeliac patients, mainly after a meal. On treatment with a gluten-free diet, both fasting and postprandial haemodynamics became normal.},

   abstract = {NF-kappa B regulates inflammatory and immune response by increasing the expression of specific genes. In celiac disease proinflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, and enzymes whose gene expression is known to be regulated by NF-kappa B are involved. This study investigated the activation of NF-kappa B in inflamed mucosa from patients with untreated celiac disease. Biopsy specimens from control, untreated, and treated patients were subjected to molecular biology analysis. NF-kappa B activation was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. NF-kappa B related subunit protein level, and inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclo-oxygenase 2 protein expression was analyzed by western blot. Both NF-kappa B/DNA binding activity and p50/p65 nuclear levels were higher in biopsy specimens from untreated patients than in those from treated patients and controls. The degradation of I kappa B beta in the cytosol and the reappearance in the nucleus indicated a persistent NF-kappa B activation in celiac disease. NF-kappa B activity was maintained in cultured biopsy specimens up to 6 h and decreased at 24 h, and then the addition of peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin caused the recovery of NF-kappa B activity at 6 h. NF-kappa B/DNA binding activity was correlated with inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclo-oxygenase-2 protein expression. These results show for the first time that NF-kappa B is activated in the inflamed mucosa of celiac patients and suggest that it may represent a molecular target for the modulation of inflammatory response in celiac disease.},

Based on tagging with a monodansylcadaverine fluorescent probe, six alpha/beta-, gamma-gliadin, and low molecular weight glutenin peptides were identified by nanospray tandem mass spectrometry. In functioning as an acyl acceptor, tissue transglutaminase was able to form complexes with the glutamine-rich gliadin peptides, whereas by lowering pH, the peptides were deamidated by transglutaminase at the same Q residues, which were previously transamidated. The main common feature shared by the peptides was the consensus sequence Q-X-P. Our findings offer relevant information for the understanding of how dietary peptides interact with the host organism in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune blistering skin disorder that is associated with gluten sensitivity. It presents as a papulovesicular rash and is often associated with enteropathy. The rash resolves when the patient is placed on a gluten-free diet and/or dapsone. DH, as well as celiac disease, is tightly associated with DQ2 and DQ8. A novel mouse model for DH is described that utilizes the NOD background and the HLA-DQ8 transgene. The addition of DQ8 contributes sensitivity to gliadin, and the addition of the NOD background contributes to autoimmunity and pathogenesis. Fifteen NOD DQ8+ mice of 90 that were sensitized to gluten developed blistering pathology similar to that seen in DH. Neutrophil infiltration of the dermis, deposition of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction, and a complete reversal of the blistering phenomenon with the administration of a gluten-free diet with or without dapsone were observed. None of the 3 blistering mice examined had small-bowel pathology. This animal model of DH will be useful to determine the specificity of the IgA deposits, as well as the pathogenic mechanisms that occur in the skin as a result of gluten ingestion.},

   abstract = {Celiac Sprue is a widely prevalent immune disease of the small intestine induced by dietary gluten intake in genetically susceptible individuals. It has been suggested that prolyl endopeptidases (PEPs) may be useful catalysts for gluten detoxification. We have investigated this hypothesis using food-grade gluten as the target antigen, and a combination of mass spectrometry and patient-derived T cells as quantitative assay systems. Spectrometric characterization of physiologically proteolyzed gluten revealed a number of 10 to 50 residue peptides containing known T cell epitopes involved in Celiac Sprue pathogenesis. Several of these peptides were multivalent, suggesting they may be potent triggers of the inflammatory response to gluten in celiac patients. Treatment of proteolyzed gluten with recombinant bacterial PEP decreased the number of potentially immunostimulatory peptides. Substantially reduced immunogenicity was also quantified in 12 of 14 intestinal polyclonal T cell lines from celiac patients. Kinetic investigations using eight T cell clones showed rapid destruction of alpha-gliadin epitopes, but less complete processing of gamma-gliadin epitopes. Given the difficulty associated with a strict lifelong gluten-exclusion diet, the ability of a single enzyme to greatly reduce the antigenic burden of grocery store gluten reinforces the case for developing oral peptidase therapy against Celiac Sprue.},

   abstract = {MHC class I chain-related gene A (MICA), a putative independent susceptibility gene in autoimmune diseases, encodes a surface protein present in epithelial cells that binds to NKG2D, an activating receptor of NK, alphabeta and gammadelta T cells, and could function as a stress-inducible activator of the innate immune response. There is no evidence of a long-term implication of MICA in the celiac autoimmune process. However, it could be that gliadin activation of MICA occurs only during the initial stages of the disease. In order to determine whether MICA is activated in response to gliadin in patients with celiac disease (CD), small intestinal mucosa biopsy samples from ten long-standing celiac patients on a gluten-free diet and from five non-celiac individuals were incubated with and without gliadin for 4 h. Total RNA was purified and MICA, IFNG and NKG2D mRNA were quantified by fluorescent real-time RT-PCR. Expression levels were calculated relative to GAPDH. MICA expression was detected in both patients and controls, but incubation with gliadin induced a strong increase in samples from the treated CD group compared with the non-CD controls (P=0.028), while no differences were observed for IFNG or NKG2D mRNA levels. The gliadin-provoked over-expression of MICA in "normalized" tissues from CD patients suggests a role for this stress-induced activator of the immune response in the early stages of organ-specific autoimmune destruction, probably preceding the onset of inflammation.},

RESULT: Additional investigation revealed duodenal villous atrophy and positivity for anti-endomysium and anti-gliadin antibodies. Celiac disease diagnosis was performed and symptoms and laboratory abnormalities improved after gluten-free diet.

AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of coeliac disease testing in suspected irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: We used decision analysis to estimate the number of coeliac disease cases detected, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and costs resulting from testing suspected irritable bowel syndrome patients for tissue transglutaminase antibody or an antibody panel (tissue transglutaminase, gliadin, total immunoglobulin A). Positive tests prompted endoscopic biopsy. A gluten-free diet improved quality of life in coeliac disease. RESULTS: Assuming a coeliac disease prevalence of 3%, tissue transglutaminase detected 28 and the panel detected 29 of 30 coeliac disease cases among 1000 suspected irritable bowel syndrome patients. The cost/case detected was $4600 with tissue transglutaminase and $8800 with the panel. The cost/quality-adjusted life-year gained with tissue transglutaminase was $7400, and the incremental cost/quality-adjusted life-year gained for the panel vs. tissue transglutaminase was $287 000. Tissue transglutaminase cost under $100 000/quality-adjusted life-year gained at a coeliac disease prevalence >/=1.1%, assuming a modest utility gain of 0.005 with coeliac disease diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for coeliac disease in patients with suspected irritable bowel syndrome is likely to be cost-effective even at a relatively low coeliac disease prevalence and with small improvements in quality of life with a gluten-free diet.},

OBSERVATION: In a 40 year-old man with acute diarrhoea with 7 non-bleeding stools per day, upper digestive tract endoscopy showed a villosity atrophy aspect confirmed by the histological examination. The search for specific antibodies of a coeliac disease was positive. A gluten-free diet led to the disappearance of the diarrhoea, followed by the disappearance of the specific antibodies and the regression of the villosity atrophy. COMMENTS: Acute diarrhoea that resists medical treatment must evoke the hypothesis of a coeliac disease and lead to a gastroscopy with duodenal biopsies. The interest of evoking the diagnosis is not only in order to obtain the rapid disappearance of the clinical signs after the introduction of a gluten-free diet but also to avoid an increase in the high risk of malignant lesions of the small intestine.},

Active interleukin (IL)-18 is expressed in the small intestinal mucosa in CD but not in healthy controls. IL-18 enhances intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression. We analyzed IL-18 serum levels in CD patients before and after gluten-free diet and the possible correlation with soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) serum levels. METHODS: The study comprises ten CD patients before and after gluten free diet and ten healthy controls. Serum IL-18 and sICAM-1 levels were assayed by immunoenzymatic methods. RESULTS: Serum IL-18 and sICAM-1 levels were significantly higher in patients with CD before diet with respect to healthy controls (P<0.05), with a highly significant correlation between the two parameters (Rho=0.800, P=0.0167). Gluten free diet significantly reduces IL-18 and sICAM-1. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that IL-18 serum concentrations correlated with the clinical status of CD patients suggesting a role for this cytokine in the pathophysiology of this disease.},

In that context we analyzed whether CD patients are more able to judge the risk of a food or a situation after practicing with the interactive training software. Sixty-four CD patients were included and randomized in two groups. While the first group used the CBITP, the control group received written instructions. Before and after taking part in the training program and 3 weeks later, the participants filled in a questionnaire for celiac knowledge. The results show that both intervention and control groups increased knowledge about CD. However, the intervention group showed significantly better outcome. A CBITP significantly increases knowledge and sustainability as compared to a conventional training for CD patients. CBITPs can enhance patients' training and treatment.},

Because this vagal afferent activity is carried in the coeliac and coeliac accessory branches of the subdiaphragmatic vagus, we tested the hypothesis that the activity arises from vagal afferents that innervate a proximal segment of the gastrointestinal tract. Surgical removal of the duodenum, but not the stomach, produces a marked (six orders of magnitude) leftward shift in the dose-response curve for intraplantar capsaicin-induced inhibition of synovial plasma extravasation induced by the potent inflammatory mediator bradykinin, in the knee joint; this is similar in magnitude to the inhibition produced by subdiaphragmatic or by coeliac plus coeliac accessory branch vagotomy. Fasting, to unload mechanically sensitive polymodal afferents in the proximal gastrointestinal tract, produces a similar leftward shift in the dose-response curve for the inhibitory effect of capsaicin, an effect that is reversed by balloon distension in the duodenum in fasted rats, while balloon distension postvagotomy had no effect. These results suggest that activation of mechanically sensitive vagal afferents in the duodenum contributes vagal afferent activity that modulates neuroendocrine control of the inflammatory response.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Fibrinolysis is involved in numerous systemic processes, including inflammation and tissue remodeling. Up to date researchers focused on hemostasis problems in patients with cirrhosis. There are little data about fibrynolysis in patient with chronic viral hepatitis. The aim of the study was to evaluate selected fibrinolytic parameters in children with chronic B or C hepatitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 98 children aged 4 to 17 years (27F, 71M) with histopatologically confirmed chronic B or C hepatitis were included in the study. The control group consisted of 51 children median aged 12.5 years (25F, 26M) on strict gluten-free diet at least 5 years because of coeliac disease. In platelet-poor plasma obtained from all children selected fibrinolytic parameters were determined: fibrinogen level (Hemolab Fibrinomat bioMerieux S.A.), plasminogen activity (Berichrom-Plasminogen Behring), tissue plasminogen activator antigen level (t-PA) (Imulyse t-PA Biopool), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 level (PAI-1) (Imulyse PAI-1 Biopool), plasmin-alpha2-antiplasmin complex level (PAP) (Enzygnost PAP micro) oraz D-dimer level (Vidas D-Dimer bioMerieux S.A.). RESULTS: In children with chronic viral hepatitis statistically significant lower fibrinogen level (p<0.03) and PAI-1 level (p<0.0001) and higher t-PA level (p<0.0001) in comparison to control group were found. In children with chronic B hepatitis significant lower PAI-1 level (p<0.0001) and higher PAP level (p<0.0001) than in controls were observed. In children with chronic C hepatitis statistically significant lower PAI-1 level (p<0.0001) and fibrinogen level (p<0.005) and higher PAP level (p<0.0001) and t-PA level (p<0.03) were found. There were no differences in fibrinolytic parameters levels between children with B and C hepatitis. CONCLUSION: Activation of fibrinolysis, especially plasminogenesis seems to be present in children with chronic viral hepatitis independently on type of hepatotropic virus.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Analysis of antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG) has been shown valuable in the diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) but how quickly serum titres decrease after introduction of a gluten-free diet (GFD) is not known in adults. CD is a well-recognized disorder amongst the general population and many persons try a GFD for fairly vague symptoms before they seek medical advice. Therefore, it is important to determine the time that the serologic tests remain predictive of the disease after the introduction of a GFD. METHODS: Sera were taken from 22 consecutively biopsy-proven adult patients with CD in connection with the diagnostic biopsy. The patients were followed for 1 year and sera were taken after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after start of a GFD. Sera were stored at -20 degrees C and analysed for IgA antibodies against gliadin, endomysium and two different commercial tTG assays based on recombinant human tTG (tTGrh) and guinea-pig liver (tTGgp). RESULTS: Twenty patients could be followed during GFD and all antibody titres fell sharply within 1 month after introduction of a GFD and continued to decline during the survey interval. Thirty days after beginning the diet only 58, 84, 74 and 53% of all patients had positive antibody levels of tTGrh, tTGgp, EmA and AGA respectively. CONCLUSIONS: As the antibodies used to confirm the diagnosis of CD fall rapidly and continue to decline following the introduction of a GFD, it is important that health care providers carefully inquire about the possibility of self-prescribed diets before patients sought medical attention.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of GI symptoms in adults with celiac disease (CD) treated with a gluten-free diet for several years. METHODS: We studied a cohort of adults with CD (n = 51; 59% women) aged 45-64 yr and proved to be in remission after 8-12 yr of treatment. They were examined by the GI Symptom Rating Scale, which comprises five syndromes: indigestion, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and reflux. A general population sample (n = 182; 57% women) of same age served as controls. RESULTS: Subjects with CD reported significantly more GI symptoms than the general population sample, as assessed by the GI Symptom Rating Scale total score (p < 0.01). This was particularly true for women with CD who scored worse than female controls for all syndromes on the GI Symptom Rating Scale. By contrast, the men with CD reported no more symptoms than male controls. The women with CD showed generally more complaints than the men with CD did, notably within indigestion, constipation, and abdominal pain, corresponding to a 2-fold higher rate of GI symptoms (60% vs 29%; p < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Adult CD patients on a gluten-free diet for several years experienced significantly more GI symptoms than the general population sample. This may have some of its origin in the composition of a gluten-free diet. The symptoms were more pronounced in the women. This may raise questions of an association with their subjective health status, which has been shown to be lower than in men with CD.},

Celiac disease is one of the most common causes of intestinal malabsorption during childhood, and its association with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has been previously reported. Here the authors describe an otherwise asymptomatic diabetic adolescent boy with iron deficiency anemia that was not responsive to oral iron therapy. A diagnosis of celiac disease was made based on both anti-endomysial antibody titers and small intestinal biopsy. Institution of a gluten-free diet resulted in correction of the anemia. These observations emphasize the importance of considering a diagnosis of celiac disease in patients with nonresponsive iron deficiency anemia, particularly in the setting of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.},

Until now, it is not known conclusively whether trace amounts of gluten might be allowed in the diet, as suggested by Codex Alimentarius. Gluten-free foods intended for dietary use can now be analysed reliably for residual gluten by the new R5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system. Some major problems of gluten analysis (sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility) can be solved by the new method. Therefore, the information given by the new test system is relevant and superior to earlier methods. Further clinical studies using small dose challenges and dietary records including gluten analysis are necessary until a more meaningful discussion on standards for gluten-free foods can be started.},

   abstract = {The intestinal immune system discriminates between invasive pathogens and antigens that are harmless, such as food proteins and commensal bacteria. The latter groups of antigens normally induce tolerance and a breakdown in this homeostatic process can lead to diseases such as coeliac disease or Crohn's disease. The nature ofthe intestinal immune response depends on how antigen is presented to CD4+ T cells by dendritic cells (DCs). Both oral tolerance and priming are influenced by the numbers and activation status of DCs in the gut and its draining lymphoid tissues, and our current work indicates that dietary proteins are taken up preferentially by DCs in the lamina propria of the small intestine. These then migrate to interact with antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in the mesenteric lymph node. In vivo and in vitro studies using purified lamina propria DCs suggest these may play a unique role in the regulation of intestinal immune responses. We propose that local DCs are the gatekeepers of the mucosal immune system, inducing tolerance under physiological conditions, but being sufficiently responsive to inflammatory stimuli to allow T cell priming and protective immunity when necessary. In addition, we will discuss evidence that adjuvant vectors such as ISCOMS may be effective mucosal vaccines due to an ability to activate intestinal DCs.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: In celiac disease in response to gluten, the immune reaction develops both in the small intestine and in cells of peripheral blood. The profile of cytokines produced by the cells differs between patients in compliance and not, with regard to gluten-free diet. THE AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of serum profile determination for chosen cytokines in monitoring of gluten-free diet in celiac patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The investigation comprised a group of 110 patients with celiac disease, who were divided into two groups: with active form of celiac disease (EmA(+), n=56) and with a non-active form of the disease (EmA (-), n = 54). The chosen cytokine IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-IO and IFN-y levels were determined in patients and soluble receptor For IL-2 (sIL-2R). For determination of the selected cytokines, brand sets of ELISA microplates (Bender Med. Systems) were used according to recommendations of the producer. The obtained results were analysed with statistical methods. RESULTS: Comparison of mean values of chosen cytokines levels in particular groups showed, that in case of sIL-2R and IL-6, they were significantly statistically higher in the group of patients complying to gluten-free diet. Statistical analysis revealed negative correlation between sIL-2R levels and the length of diet compliance in patients with non-active celiac disease and positive correlation between concentrations of sIL-2R and the titre of endomysial antibodies in the group of patients with active form of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The determination of sIL-2R levels in serum together with endomysial antibodies assessment can be used as a method for monitoring the compliance to gluten-free diet in patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In coeliac disease, inducible nitric oxide synthase activity in the duodenal mucosa is greatly increased, resulting in increased production of nitric oxide. We investigated whether this resulted in increased plasma concentrations of its stable end products (nitrate/nitrite: NOx). METHODS: Fasting plasma NOx was determined in 66 patients attending for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Of these, 21 had coeliac disease (nine were on a gluten-free diet). The remainder had a variety of other gastrointestinal disorders. NOx was determined using the Griess reaction. Distal duodenal biopsies for coeliac patients were graded according to the Marsh score. RESULTS: Patients with untreated coeliac disease had a higher fasting NOx concentration (mean 117.5 microM) than either those with coeliac disease taking a gluten-free diet (mean 71.2 microM) or those with other diseases (mean 33.5 microM; one-way analysis of variance, P < 0.001). Coeliac patients with higher fasting NOx concentrations had more marked histological changes (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Fasting plasma NOx is significantly elevated in untreated coeliac disease and correlates with histological grade. The potential clinical utility of serial NOx measurements to monitor improvement on a gluten-free diet requires further study.},

OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of a gluten-free diet on gastrointestinal symptoms in a cohort of US patients with celiac disease. DESIGN: A follow-up survey was conducted in 215 patients who were evaluated at the University of Iowa from 1990 through 1997 as having biopsy-confirmed celiac disease. The systematic survey asked detailed questions regarding gastrointestinal symptoms before and after the institution of a gluten-free diet in the patients, all of whom had been given the same dietary advice. RESULTS: The group consisted of 160 female and 55 male patients. Although diarrhea was the most frequent symptom in untreated celiac disease, steatorrhea occurred in only one-fifth of patients. Other complaints were common, and most responded to gluten exclusion. The benefit of gluten exclusion was equally apparent in men and women. Diarrhea responded in most patients, usually within days, and the mean time to resolution was 4 wk. Many patients had alternating diarrhea and constipation, both of which were responsive to the gluten-free diet. Most patients had abdominal pain and bloating, which resolved with the diet. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease causes a wide range of gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinicians must have a high level of suspicion to detect the atypical forms of celiac disease. With a gluten-free diet, patients have substantial and rapid improvement of symptoms, including symptoms other than the typical ones of diarrhea, steatorrhea, and weight loss.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a complex inflammatory disorder of the small intestine, induced by dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. CD is strongly associated with HLA-DQ2 and it has recently been established that gut-derived DQ2-restricted T cells from patients with CD predominantly recognize gluten-derived peptides in which specific glutamine residues are deamidated to glutamic acid by tissue transglutaminase. Recently, intestinally expressed human genes with high homology to DQ2-gliadin celiac T-cell epitopes have been identified. Single or double point mutations which would increase the celiac T-cell epitope homology, and mutation in these genes, leading to the expression of glutamic acid at particular positions, could hypothetically be involved in the initiation of CD in HLA-DQ2-positive children. Six gene regions with high celiac T-cell epitope homology were investigated for single-nucleotide polymorphisms using direct sequencing of DNA from 20 CD patients, 27 type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients with associated CD, 24 patients with T1DM without CD and 110 healthy controls, all of Caucasian origin. No variants in any of these genes in any of the investigated groups were found. We conclude that gut-expressed human celiac epitope homologous peptides are unlikely to represent non-HLA risk factors in the development of celiac disease in Caucasians.},

It is no longer acceptable to assume that all people in Australia receive adequate vitamin D from casual exposure to sunlight. OBJECTIVE: This article provides information on causes, consequences, treatment and prevention of vitamin D deficiency in Australia. DISCUSSION: People at high risk of vitamin D deficiency include the elderly, those with skin conditions where avoidance of sunlight is required, dark skinned people (particularly women during pregnancy or if veiled) and patients with malabsorption, e.g. coeliac disease. For most people, deficiency can be prevented by 5-15 minutes exposure of face and upper limbs to sunlight 4-6 times per week. If this is not possible then a vitamin D supplement of at least 400 IU per day is recommended. In cases of established vitamin D deficiency, supplementation with 3000-5000 IU per day for at least 1 month is required to replete body stores. Increased availability of larger dose preparations of cholecalciferol would be a useful therapy in the case of severe deficiencies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Follow-up of celiac disease diagnosed in childhood is variable or nonexistent after transition to adulthood. Outcome, continuity of care, and adherence to a gluten-free diet are poorly documented. We report a 28-yr follow-up of 50 adults in whom the original childhood diagnosis could be confirmed. METHODS: Original pediatric charts were reviewed, and subjects were invited to undergo dietary evaluation, measurement of bone mineral density, and quality-of-life assessment. The mean duration of celiac was 28.5 yr, median 28.7 yr (range 22-45 yr). The mean and median age of the group was 35 yr. RESULTS: Only 22% of patients were enrolled in an adult gastroenterology clinic. Fifty percent were fully compliant with a gluten-free diet; 18% were partially compliant; and 32% were not adhering to diet. The main motivating factor for dietary compliance was avoidance of symptoms rather than avoidance of complications. Eighty-six percent of the females and 21% of the males had iron deficiency. Bone mineral density was subnormal in 32%; 28.9% were osteopenic and 2.6% were osteoporotic. Quality-of-life scores were normal. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients diagnosed with celiac in childhood receive no medical or dietary supervision after transition to adulthood. One-third are not compliant with diet; the primary motivating factor for those who do comply is avoidance of symptoms rather than fear of complications. The prevalence of preventable and treatable disorders in these young adults highlights a failure of health services after transition from pediatric to adult health care.},

Approximately half of the patients have no overt gastrointestinal symptoms and many are asymptomatic. A rare and life-threatening complication, affecting mainly children younger than 2 years of age, is the so-called coeliac crisis, a term that applies to profuse diarrhoea leading to dehydration, hypokalemia, and acidosis. We report here two cases of adult coeliac disease that presented as coeliac crisis. Coeliac disease should be a differential diagnosis in adult patients with severe acute diarrhoea and acidosis, although a rare presentation.},

AIM: To evaluate the association between the presence of AGA and EmA and villous atrophy in intestinal biopsies of children with suspected coeliac disease. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Intestinal samples of 46 children with failure to thrive, chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption and short stature with either AGA and/or EmA positivity were evaluated, retrospectively. The diagnosis of coeliac disease was based on ESPGHAN criteria. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Patients with total villous atrophy who fulfilled the ESPGHAN criteria for the diagnosis of coeliac disease were diagnosed to have coeliac disease. Nine patients without villous atrophy were taken as negative controls for this study. AGA-IgA was measured both by immunoflourescence (IF) and ELISA and EmA-IgA by IF while patients were on normal diet. Relationship between autoantibody positivity and intestinal total villous atrophy was evaluated. RESULTS: Overall positivity for AGA IgA was 85% (39/46) by IF+ELISA and EmA positivity was 85% (39/46) by IF within the study group. Histological examination revealed total villous atrophy with lymphocyte infiltration and crypt hyperplasia in 37 (80%) patients. AGA IgA was positive in 14 (38%) and 31 (84%) of these children by ELISA and IF, respectively. EmA positivity was detected in 35/37 (95%) cases with atrophy and 4/9 (44%) without atrophy (p=0.002). Thirty out of 37 (81%) patients with villous atrophy had both AGA IgA (IF) and EmA positivity (p=0.186). All of the sixteen patients that had both positive AGA IgA (ELISA+IF) and EmA had total villous atrophy (p=0.037). CONCLUSION: A significant association between total villous atrophy and EmA positivity has been documented in this study.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Both coeliac disease (CD) and Sjogren's syndrome (SS) have an autoimmune background and increased risk of oral mucosal and dental abnormalities. Individuals suffering concomitantly from CD and SS could even be at a higher risk. STUDY DESIGN: Oral mucosal and dental abnormalities were examined in 20 patients with CD + SS (mean age 61 years) and compared with age- and sex-matched controls with either CD or SS. RESULTS: Oral mucosal changes were most common in SS (80%), followed by CD + SS (65%) and CD (40%). Coeliac-type dental enamel defects were found in 89% in CD + SS and in 88% in CD compared with only 25% in SS (P < 0.001). The median number of teeth was six in the CD + SS, 24 in the CD and 22 in the SS group. The DMF index was higher (P < 0.005) in the CD + SS than in the CD group. CD + SS was characterized by higher salivary flow rate (P < 0.001) and lower inflammatory focus score in the salivary glands (P < 0.01) than SS. CONCLUSIONS: The co-occurrence of CD and SS should be recognized because of its effects on dental and oral mucosal health. A lower salivary gland inflammatory focus score and higher salivary flow rate in CD + SS than in SS suggests that a gluten-free diet treatment may alleviate autoimmune inflammation.},

Out of 65 enrolled cases of CD, 7 (10.8%) children did not follow a strict dietary compliance. Only 41 children with satisfactory dietary compliance on gluten free diet (GFD) who regularly attended the follow up for at least 6 months were evaluated for their nutritional and hematological status. Results were compared with age and sex matched controls. The mean age of diagnosis was 8.7 +/- 3.3 years. Diarrhea and failure to thrive were the most common presenting symptoms. At diagnosis, the nutritional and hematological indices were significantly lower in patients than in controls. Mean duration of follow up on GFD was 22 months (range 6-48 +/- 5.6 months). On follow up, height for age Z score was significantly lower, mean BMI was significantly higher, and weight for age Z score, weight for height Z score (%), mean triceps and biceps skin fold thickness, and mid arm circumference were comparable to controls. At diagnosis, 80% cases had microcytic hypochromic anemia and 20% had dimorphic anemia. On GFD for at least a period of more than 6 months, 19% had microcytic anemia and in 81% the hematological picture was normocytic normochromic. 60% cases had thrombocytosis at diagnosis in comparison to 2.3% after treatment. Institution of GFD leads to rapid improvement in clinical picture as well as most of the nutritional and hematological parameters.},

   abstract = {Calcium malabsorption, hypocalcemia and skeletal demineralization are well-recognized features of untreated celiac disease. This study investigates calcium absorption and bone mineral density (BMD) after a prolonged, over 4 years, treatment with a gluten-free diet. Twenty-four adult females with treated celiac disease and twenty age- and sex-matched control subjects were studied. Mean body mass index (MBI), energy intake, serum calcium, and serum 25(OH)D concentrations in treated celiacs did not differ from controls. However, while both dietary calcium and protein intake were significantly higher in celiacs (P<0.012), fractional calcium absorption was lower (mean percentage+/-SD; treated 39.8+/-12 versus controls 52.3+/-10, P<0.001). Thus, after adjusting for calcium intake, the estimated amount of calcium absorbed daily was similar in both groups. Whole body, spine and trochanter BMD were significantly lower in treated celiac patients compared with controls (P<0.05). There were significant inverse correlations between: serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and femoral neck or total body BMD (P<0.01), PTH and duration of gluten-free diet (P=0.05), and fractional calcium absorption and alkaline phosphatase (P=0.022). Increased calcium intake could potentially compensate for the reduced fractional calcium absorption in treated adult celiac patients, but may not normalize the BMD. In addition, the inverse correlation between PTH and time following treatment is suggestive of a continuing long-term benefit of gluten withdrawal on bone metabolism in celiac patients.},

Altogether, 710 patients responded: 423 (73%) with celiac disease and 70 (55%) with dermatitis herpetiformis were currently consuming oats. Patients appreciated the taste, the ease of use, and the low costs; 94% believed that oats diversified the gluten-free diet; 15% of celiac disease and 28% of dermatitis herpetiformis patients had stopped eating oats. The most common reasons for avoiding oats were fear of adverse effects or contamination. There is a market demand for oats, and celiac societies and dietitians should make efforts to promote the development of products free of wheat contamination.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests the acceptability of oats in a gluten-free diet in coeliac disease. We investigated the impact of an oats-containing diet on quality of life and gastrointestinal symptoms. METHODS: Thirty-nine coeliac disease patients on a gluten-free diet were randomized to take either 50 g of oats-containing gluten-free products daily or to continue without oats for 1 year. Quality of life was assessed using the Psychological General Well-Being questionnaire and gastrointestinal symptoms using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. Small-bowel mucosal villous architecture, CD3+, alphabeta+, gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes, serum endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies were investigated. RESULTS: Twenty-three subjects were randomized to the oats-containing diet and 16 to the traditional gluten-free diet. All adhered strictly to their respective diet. Quality of life did not differ between the groups. In general, there were more gastrointestinal symptoms in the oats-consuming group. Patients taking oats suffered significantly more often from diarrhoea, but there was a simultaneous trend towards a more severe average constipation symptom score. The villous structure did not differ between the groups, but the density of intraepithelial lymphocytes was slightly but significantly higher in the oats group. The severity of symptoms was not dependent on the degree of inflammation. Antibody levels did not increase during the study period. CONCLUSION: The oats-containing gluten-free diet caused more intestinal symptoms than the traditional diet. Mucosal integrity was not disturbed, but more inflammation was evident in the oats group. Oats provide an alternative in the gluten-free diet, but coeliac patients should be aware of the possible increase in intestinal symptoms.},

AIM: : To compare the clinical, histological and serological response to a wheat-starch-based or natural gluten-free diet in patients with newly detected coeliac disease. METHODS: Fifty-seven consecutive adults with untreated coeliac disease were randomized to a wheat-starch-based or natural gluten-free diet. Clinical response, small bowel mucosal morphology, CD3+, alphabeta+ and gammadelta+ intra-epithelial lymphocytes, mucosal human leucocyte antigen-DR expression and serum endomysial, transglutaminase and gliadin antibodies were investigated before and 12 months after the introduction of the gluten-free diet. Quality of life measurements were performed by standardized questionnaires and the bone mineral density was analysed. RESULTS: In both groups, abdominal symptoms were alleviated equally by a strict diet. There were no differences between the groups in mucosal morphology, the density of intra-epithelial lymphocytes, serum antibodies, bone mineral density or quality of life tests at the end of the study. Four patients on a natural gluten-free diet and two on a wheat-starch-based gluten-free diet had dietary lapses; as a result, inadequate mucosal, serological and clinical recovery was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The dietary response to a wheat-starch-based gluten-free diet was as good as that to a natural gluten-free diet in patients with newly detected coeliac disease.},

METHODS: Fasting serum ghrelin levels were measured in 30 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed CD, 13 celiac patients successfully treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD), and 30 healthy controls. RESULTS: Ghrelin levels were abnormally high in patients with active CD compared with controls (297 +/- 17.6 vs 218 +/- 15.2 pmol/L, p<0.01) and correlated positively with intestinal mucosal lesion severity (rs=0.444, p<0.02). In the successfully GFD-treated patients, ghrelin values were normal compared with controls (233 +/- 22.0 vs 218 +/- 15.2 pmol/L, ns) and, moreover, correlated negatively with body mass index (r=-0.632, p=0.02), unlike in the untreated patient group (r=-0.263, ns). CONCLUSION: High ghrelin levels characterized our series of adult patients with newly diagnosed CD and correlated significantly with the degree of severity of intestinal mucosal lesions. This is the first evidence of a relationship between ghrelin and inflammatory processes, but the mechanisms involved are still unclear. Furthermore, our findings suggest that an interplay of hormonal, metabolic, and nutritional factors could influence ghrelin secretion under pathophysiological circumstances.},

Coeliac disease if untreated, although clinically silent, predispose for other autoimmune disease, large scale screening methods are needed for an early diagnosis. The recently introduced ELISA methods to detect tTG antibodies, that used as antigen Guinea Pig tissue transglutaminase provide an efficient alternative to the anti-endomysial (EMA) immunofluorescent method and are suitable for screening. Our aim was to compare the commercial kit utilizing tTG from guinea pig (GP-tTG) to the standard method that we developed in our laboratory and with the new method that employed human recombinant tTG (hr-tTG). METHODS: We tested serum samples from 16 untreated celiac patients, 10 coeliac patients in gluten free diet, 22 subjects with other disease and 32 healthy controls, for a total number of 80 sera, with 3 commercial kit which employed GP-tTG and 1 that employed hr-tTG, as reference method we used an ELISA method developed in our laboratory and the immunofluorescence method to detect EMA. RESULTS: Results show that methods employing human tTG had a sensibility of 100% with a specificity of 98% and a predictive value of 94%, instead methods employing GP-tTG show inferior results. CONCLUSION. We conclude that is better using hr-tTG as antigen in screening methods for coeliac disease.},

In coeliac disease (CD) bilateral occipital calcifications and seizure semiology consistent with an occipital origin have been described, primarily in Mediterranean countries. By reporting three adult patients from an Australian outpatient clinic with visual disturbances, occipital cerebral calcifications, and CD, this study seeks to emphasise that CD should be considered even when patients of non-Mediterranean origin present with these symptoms. Seizure types included simple partial, complex-partial, and secondarily generalised seizures. The seizure semiology consisted of visual disturbances such as: blurred vision, loss of focus, seeing coloured dots, and brief stereotyped complex visual hallucinations like seeing unfamiliar faces or scenes. Symptoms of malabsorption were not always present. Neurological examination was unremarkable in two patients, impaired dexterity and mild hemiatrophy on the left was noted in one. Routine electroencephalography was unremarkable. In all cases, computed tomography demonstrated bilateral cortical calcification of the occipital-parietal regions. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no additional lesion. All patients had biopsy confirmed CD. Seizure control improved after treatment with gluten free diet and anticonvulsants. This report illustrates the association between seizures of occipital origin, cerebral calcifications, and CD even in patients not of Mediterranean origin.},

METHODS: Since first-degree relatives of CD patients have a high prevalence of CD, we screened 92 children and adolescents, all first-degree relatives of coeliac patients, for EMA and total IgA antibodies, once a year. RESULTS: Among 11 relatives, at the time of the first screening, 6 already had a positive serology and histology for CD, while 5 became positive only after a period of 2 to 5 y of negative testing. The jejunal mucosa biopsy of these five relatives with retarded positive serology for CD showed a flat mucosa in four of them and a partial villous atrophy in one. They were all HLA DQ2 positive and clinically silent for CD. CONCLUSION: CD can manifest itself after years of negative serological testing.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Coeliac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy characterized by an enhanced permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier. In epithelial cells paracellular permeability is regulated by intercellular tight junction. The cytoplasmic protein ZO-1 interacts directly with F-actin and plays a pivotal role in the structural and functional organization of tight junction. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and localization of ZO-1 in the intestinal mucosa of coeliac patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with active coeliac disease, seven of whom underwent a repeat biopsy following a gluten-free diet and 27 control subjects, were studied. In all subjects, three biopsies were obtained from distal duodenum during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. ZO-1 protein localization and levels were detected by immunofluorescence followed by confocal microscopy analysis and immunoblotting. ZO-1 mRNA expression was assessed by RT-PCR. F-actin distribution was also investigated. RESULTS: In patients with active coeliac disease, both ZO-1 protein levels and mRNA were clearly reduced. Cytoskeletal organization was disrupted with F-actin staining concentrated at the subcortical and basal surface regions. Abnormalities in ZO-1 expression and actin organization were reversed after a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: In active coeliac disease, ZO-1 protein expression is downregulated at the transcriptional level in association with F-actin redistribution. These changes are completely reversed after a gluten-free diet and could contribute to the increased intestinal paracellular permeability observed in this disorder.},

In patients with gastrointestinal symptoms that prompt gastroscopy, a small bowel biopsy should always be obtained, for it alone detects sprue. Despite the high level of accuracy of antibody determination, there is no substitution for the demonstration of atrophic villi in biopsy material. In the absence of a diagnosis, a gluten-free diet should not be recommended, since in patients who actually have the disease, mucosal changes will regress, and confirmation of the diagnosis is no longer possible. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, treatment comprises a life-long gluten-free diet, which not only leads to an improvement of the symptoms, but also eliminates the increased lymphoma risk.},

Diagnosis of celiac sprue is based on proof of histopathological changes in jejunum mucosa as a result of presence of gluten in food. In recent years, serum endogenous myosin and tissue transglutaminase antibodies were used in a diagnostic algorithm. We distinguish active, silent, latent, and potential celiac sprue. Simultaneous incidence of type I diabetes mellitus and celiac sprue has been documented in a range of studies. Both diseases have common immunology and genetic characters. Prevalence of celiac sprue in patients with type I diabetes is several times higher compared to prevalence of this disease in the population. There is the prevalence of celiac sprue 3.6-5.1% in children with type I diabetes mellitus in the Czech Republic, silent form of the disease is the most frequent one. An effect of a strict gluten free diet on a metabolic control of diabetes has not been proved. It is necessary to assess (at least once per two years) actively and on regular basis endogenous myosin and/or tissue transglutaminase antibodies in patients with type I diabetes.},

Gluten-free diet, started soon after the diagnosis, led to progressive seizure control, allowing significant decrease in dosage of anti-epileptic drugs. This case corroborates the importance of serological screening tests for celiac disease, at least in patients with difficult to control epilepsy.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (Celiacal sprue = gluten-sensitive enteropathy = netropic sprue) is the all-life genetically determined autoimmune disease with permanent intolerance to gluten, which damages the intestinal mucous membrane and alterates the immune system. The atrophy and typical inflammatory changes of mucous membrane results in malabsorption with diarrhea, general weakness, anemia and weight loss. The clinical picture of celiac disease is considerably heterologous. Only 20-30% of patients suffer from active-classical form of the disease. Non-diagnosed, inactive forms of the disease form 70-80% of cases of celiac disease in adult individuals. The therapy is based on diet without gluten. Application of the diet usually results in clinical improvement and signs of the disease are diminished. The relapse of celiac disease occurs after a gluten load. Celiac disease and dermatitis Duhring are considered to be two equal forms how gluten enteropathy becomes manifest. Celiac disease is often associated with other autoimmune diseases (e.g. insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyreoiditis). Untreated celiac disease still represents a serious medical risk, since it is an important precancerosis. Introduction of highly sensitive methods for the determination of antibodies against endomysium and tissue transglutaminase significantly extended possibilities of diagnosis and screening for celiac disease. It became obvious that the real incidence of celiac disease including the non-diagnosed forms of the disease in the European population is greater than 1:200 to 1:250.},

A total of 106 children of short stature and no gastrointestinal symptoms were studied. An extensive endocrine work-up had been negative for all of them and an additional investigation was performed by measuring the concentration of antiendomysial antibody. Patients who were positive for antiendomysial antibody (> or =1:10) or who exhibited IgA deficiency (less than 5 mg/dl) were referred for an endoscopic intestinal biopsy. We detected a pathological titer of antiendomysial IgA in six of these patients. Five of them showed histological abnormalities compatible with celiac disease and one had normal histology and was considered to have potential celiac disease. The prevalence of celiac disease in the population studied was 4.7% (with another 0.9% of the subjects being considered to have potential celiac disease). The children with celiac disease did not differ in any of the parameters tested when compared to those without celiac disease, though they showed an improvement in growth velocity after treatment with a gluten-free diet. We conclude that it is important to test all children with short stature for celiac disease by measuring antiendomysial IgA.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient who presented with hypocalcemia and hypocalciuria as the initial manifestations of celiac disease, despite a normal vitamin D status. METHODS: We review the diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and biochemical and bone mineral density responses of a patient with asymptomatic celiac disease, which was initially suggested because of a low serum calcium level that became attributable to isolated malabsorption of calcium. RESULTS: A 36-year-old woman presented with hypocalcemia in the presence of normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and high serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. She had hypocalciuria and secondary hyperparathyroidism that were refractory to pharmacologic calcium and cholecalciferol supplementation. Fecal calcium excretion indicated malabsorption of calcium, and biopsy of the small intestine demonstrated pathologic changes characteristic of celiac disease. Bone mineral density, determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, was in the osteopenic range at the femoral neck. The initiation of a gluten-free diet resulted in correction of all biochemical abnormalities and a substantial increase in bone mineral density. CONCLUSION: Primary intestinal malabsorption of calcium without concomitant vitamin D deficiency is possible in celiac disease because of the preferential involvement of the proximal small intestine early in the disease process. Our patient had hypocalcemia caused by celiac disease and values for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D that were normal and elevated, respectively. Correction was demonstrated after dietary gluten withdrawal.},

   abstract = {About 10,000 years ago domestication and farming of wheat and other cereals developed in the 'Fertile Crescent', an area including modern Turkey, Iraq and Iran. Agriculture then slowly spread from Middle East to Europe. Coeliac disease is the permanent intolerance to dietary gluten, the major protein component of wheat. It has been until relatively recently hypothesised that wheat consumption exerted a negative selective pressure on genes predisposing to coeliac disease, eventually leading to higher coeliac disease frequency in Northeastern Europe because of lack of exposure to cereals. This theory is at variance with recent studies showing that coeliac disease is as common in Middle Eastern countries as in Europe. High prevalence of coeliac disease has been found in Iran, in both the general population and at-risk groups, e.g. patients with irritable bowel syndrome or type 1 diabetes. Clinical manifestations of coeliac disease vary markedly with the age of the patient, the duration and the extent of disease. Clinical studies showed that presentation with non-specific symptoms or no symptoms is as common in the Middle East as in Europe. Wheat represented a major component of the Iranian diet for many centuries and it may be argued that the continuous and high level of exposure to wheat proteins has induced some degree of immune tolerance, leading to milder symptoms that may be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome or unexplained gastrointestinal disorders. The gluten-free diet represents a real challenge to both patients and clinicians in this area. This is particularly difficult in the absence of any supply for gluten-free diet in Middle Eastern countries.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Autoantibodies are used as markers for celiac disease (CD) identifying patients with mucosal lesions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and role of the autoantibodies such as IgA antiendomysium (EMA), IgA antigliadin (AGA) and the IgA antitissue transglutaminase (tTGA) in histogenesis of celiac disease. METHODS: Seventy-nine cases including 30 untreated celiacs, 5 celiacs on gluten-free diet (GFD), 41 first degree relatives and 3 non-relatives suspected for CD were investigated. Three untreated celiacs with IgA deficiency were excluded from this study group. IgA antibodies to tTGA were determined by ELISA, as described before. Twelve of 41 relatives and 2 cases of non relatives suspected with positive serology underwent a small intestinal biopsy. Results were correlated with the degrees of abnormality of the intestinal mucosa in patients with CD. Intestinal biopsies obtained from study population were evaluated for histological quantification. RESULTS: Celiacs and suspected cases with positive EMA/AGA and or tTGA showed shorter villi (p < 0.007) and/or a higher number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) (p < 0.035). The sensitivity of serology (EMA, AGA, tTGA) in patients with Marsh IIIc was 100%. However, in patients with Marsh IIIa the sensitivity for EMA, AGA, and tTGA was 40%, 50% and 20% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The appearance of antibodies is related to the degree of mucosal infiltration by IELs. Although tTGA, like EMA provide a highly sensitive parameter for the detection of celiacs with severe mucosal damage, it appears to be less sensitive (even less than AGA) in celiac patients with milder histopathological abnormalities. However, it should be recognized that the substantial part of the celiac population present with these milder forms of mucosal abnormalities. Using tTGA as a single test in screening may result in missing up to 60-70% of celiacs with mild mucosal abnormalities. Combination with other screening tests (at least with AGA) is essential and strongly recommended},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Magnesium deficiency has been reported in coeliac disease (CD) with clinical symptoms. The aim of this study was to evaluate magnesium status in CD without malabsorption symptoms in patients aged 5-18 years. In the study participated 41 coeliac patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD) for a mean 11 years with IgAEmA (-) and normal villi, 28 patients with untreated subclinical (atypical) CD with IgAEmA (+) and villous atrophy, and 8 healthy subjects as a control group. METHOD: Magnesium status was examined by an intravenous Mg loading test, determination of serum and erythrocyte Mg concentrations, and urinary excretion. Steatorrhea was assessed by fecal fat excretion. Magnesium, calcium, protein, and fat intake were evaluated by a food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: The frequency of magnesium deficiency as assessed by the magnesium loading test was: 19.6% in treated, 21.4% in untreated CD patients, and 25% in control group, similar in both sexes, sporadic in small towns (3.8%), frequent in large cities and rural villages (23.5% vs. 32.3%). Fat excretion was within normal limits. The following results were found, respectively: decreased serum magnesium concentration, 7.3% vs. 3.6% vs. 0%, decreased erythrocyte Mg concentration, 14.6% vs. 25% vs. 12.5%; decreased intake of magnesium, 29% vs. 32% vs. 0%. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of magnesium deficiency was similar in pediatric patients who were treated for CD or in patients with subclinical CD, and in control group; magnesium deficiency in patients participating in our study depended on an imbalanced diet.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To study the effect of gluten-free diet on growth and diabetic control of children with type 1 diabetes mellitus and coeliac disease. METHODS: Twenty one children (mean age 7.5 years, range 1.6-12.9) with type 1 diabetes, primarily initially identified on the basis of symptoms and consecutively diagnosed with coeliac disease by biopsy over a 10 year period, were matched by sex, age at onset, and duration of diabetes with two diabetic controls without coeliac disease. Weight, height, haemoglobin A1c, and insulin requirements were measured before and for 12 months after the diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease. Dietary awareness and adherence were assessed by structured questionnaire. RESULTS: A gluten-free diet resulted in a significant increase in weight-for-age z scores at 12 months after diagnosis (mean increase in z score 0.33) and in BMI (mean increase in z score 0.32). Increases in height did not achieve statistical significance. Controls showed no significant changes in weight, height, or BMI over the same period. Insulin dosage at diagnosis was less in coeliacs than in controls (mean difference 0.16 units/kg/day), but was similar to controls once a gluten-free diet had been established. Questionnaires were obtained in 20 patients. There appeared to be a relation between dietary awareness/adherence and growth parameters, but the small number of patients with "poor/fair" dietary adherence prevented meaningful analysis of this group. CONCLUSION: Identification and dietary treatment of coeliac disease in children with diabetes improved growth and influenced diabetic control. Evaluation of the outcome of treatment of coeliac disease in diabetics should include assessments of gluten intake.},

   abstract = {In most individuals minute amounts of food proteins pass undegraded across the intestinal mucosa and trigger antibody formation. Children with coeliac disease have enhanced antibody production against gliadin as well as other dietary antigens, e.g. beta-lactoglobulin, in cow's milk. Antibody avidity, i.e. the binding strength between antibody and antigen, often increases during antibody responses and may be related to the biological effectiveness of antibodies. The aim of the present study was to determine the avidity of serum IgG antibodies against beta-lactoglobulin and gliadin in healthy children during early childhood and compare these avidities to those found in children with coeliac disease. The average antibody avidity was analysed using a thiocyanate elution assay, whereas the antibody activity of the corresponding sera was assayed by ELISA. The avidity of serum IgG antibodies against beta-lactoglobulin as well as gliadin increased with age in healthy children, even in the face of falling antibody titres to the same antigens. Children with untreated coeliac disease had IgG anti-beta-lactoglobulin antibodies of significantly higher avidity than healthy children of the same age, and the same trend was observed for IgG antigliadin antibodies. The present data suggest that the avidities of antibodies against dietary antigens increase progressively during early childhood, and that this process seems to be accelerated during active coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate frequency of clinical manifestations, biochemical and morphological alterations characteristic of liver affection in patients with glutenic enteropathy (GEP) in correlation with GE duration and severity of malabsorption syndrome (MAS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 116 GEP patients have undergone clinico-laboratory examination, intestinoscopy with biopsy of jejunal mucosa, puncture biopsy of the liver with morphological examination of the specimens, ultrasonography of the liver. In addition, the immune status was assessed and tests for markers of hepatotropic viruses B and C were made. RESULTS: Clinical symptoms, typical for hepatic lesion in GEP patients, such as yellowness of the skin and scleras, palmar erythema, vascular stella and hepatomegaly were found in 7.2% cases. Hyperaminotransferasemia was detected in 48.4% of new cases of celiac disease, in 18.1% of patients on strict aglutenic diet. Aminotransferase hyperactivity detection was associated with severity of MAS. Morphological alterations in the liver in celiac disease are characterized by fat dystrophy, portal and periportal hepatitis, steatohepatitis or fibrosis. Combined therapy of celiac disease including strict aglutenic diet, correction of metabolic disturbances was not always effective in correction of metabolic processes in the liver. In new GEP cases early adequate therapy was most effective. CONCLUSION: The course of glutenic enteropathy is accompanied with clinicomorphological alterations in the liver. This necessitates use of drugs improving liver function.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food allergy (FA) is characterized by an abnormal immunologic reactivity to food proteins. The gastro-intestinal tract serves not only a nutritive function but also is a major immunologic organ. Although previously thought to be triggered primarily by an IgE-mediated mechanism of injury, considerable evidence now suggests that non-IgE mechanisms may also be involved in the pathogenesis of FA. OBJECTIVE: To review the immunologic disturbances that occur in FA and to correlate these with the clinical manifestations expressed in affected target organs based upon a classification of IgE and non-IgE mechanisms. METHODS: Data collected from a computerized MEDLINE search were used for the analysis of the following topics: immediate GI hypersensitivity, oral allergy syndrome, acute urticaria and angioedema, acute bronchospasm, celiac disease, cow's milk enteropathy, dietary protein enterocolitis, breast milk colitis, proctolitis, proctitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, Heiner syndrome, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, atopic dermatitis, asthma, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder and behavioral disorders, as well as systems affected by mucosal associated lymphoid tissue-mediated injury of associated lymphoid tissues and the immunologic deviation to Th1 or Th2 mechanisms of FA. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review allow the construction of a central, unifying hypothesis for a new classification of FA as follows: the clinical manifestations of FA, expressed in affected target organs, may be the result of immunologic injury mediated by interaction of food antigens with contiguous elements of mucosal associated lymphoid tissue. These appear to be modulated by relative imbalances of the Th1/Th2 paradigm, which may be the ultimate determinant governing the expression of FA as IgE-mediated, non--IgE-mediated, or mixed forms of IgE/non-IgE mechanisms of FA.},

METHODS: Twenty-seven (16 female) patients with untreated celiac disease were included for detailed gastrointestinal transit measurement and calculation of BMI. Ten patients (5 female) were also studied after dietary treatment. A newly developed radiological transit procedure was used. Eighty-three healthy subjects were used as controls. RESULTS: In untreated male patients BMI was significantly reduced compared to healthy males, and small bowel transit time (SBTT) was significantly longer compared with healthy males, 3.9 (1.2-5.5) versus 2.5 h (1.4-4.3), median and percentile 10 and 90, respectively, and p= 0.04. In the 10 men and women with repeated measurements, BMI increased significantly and small bowel transit accelerated after treatment and was 3.6 h (1.7-5.5) before treatment and 2.3 h (0.7-4.0) after treatment, and p= 0.007. In women, BMI did not differ significantly between untreated patients and healthy subjects, and 31% of the female patients were overweight. Small bowel transit was significantly faster in untreated female patients who were overweight compared with lean female patients. CONCLUSION: Small bowel transit seems to be delayed in lean patients with untreated celiac disease. BMI may have some influence on the variations of small bowel transit before and after treatment.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an enteropathy characterized by a Th1-type immune response to the dietary gluten. The transcriptional mechanisms or factors that control Th1 cell development in this condition remain to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to analyze in CD the expression of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF)-1, a transcription factor that regulates the differentiation and function of Th1 cells. Duodenal biopsies were taken from children with untreated CD and control children, and analyzed for IRF-1 by Southern blotting of reverse-transcriptase PCR products and Western blotting. IRF-1 DNA-binding activity was assessed by electrophoretic shift mobility assay. The effect of gliadin stimulation on IRF-1 induction was investigated in an ex vivo organ culture of treated CD biopsies. Enhanced IRF-1 was seen in untreated CD in comparison with controls. This was evident at both the RNA and protein level. Furthermore, untreated CD samples exhibited stronger nuclear accumulation and DNA-binding activity of IRF-1 than controls. In contrast, IRF-2, a transcriptional repressor that binds the same DNA element and competes with IRF-1, was expressed at the same level in nuclear proteins extracted from both untreated CD and control patients. In explant cultures of treated CD biopsies, gliadin enhanced both IRF-1 RNA and protein. This effect was prevented by a neutralizing IFN-gamma antibody. Furthermore, stimulation of normal duodenal biopsies with IFN-gamma enhanced IRF-1. These data indicate that IRF-1 is a hallmark of the gliadin-mediated inflammation in CD and suggest that IFN-gamma/IRF-1 signaling pathway can play a key role in maintaining and expanding the local Th1 inflammatory response in this disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is characterized by intestinal mucosal injury and malabsorption precipitated by dietary exposure to gluten of some cereals with a prominent role being played by gliadins, specific antigenic determinants found in wheat gluten. Patients suffering from celiac disease have serum antibodies recognizing gliadin, as well as the endomysial autoantigen tissue transglutaminase. Phage display antibody libraries have revealed ectopic production of anti-transglutaminase antibodies by intestinal lymphocytes with a biased use of the VH5 antibody gene family. Here we report a study on the pairing of VH and VL families in the antibodies to transglutaminase. Our results led to the construction of small phage display antibody libraries based on the amplification of the two genes in the VH5 family from intestinal lymphocytes. This method can be used for the rapid characterization of the anti-transglutaminase response in a potentially large number of subjects including asymptomatic patients whose serum antibodies may be undetectable.},

   abstract = {HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: A 60-year old woman presented with osteoporosis. Because clinical symptoms did not improve after treatment, further diagnostic procedures were performed in order to further characterize the metabolic bone disease. The patient reported loss of weight,nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms (recurrent abdominal pain),and constipation. The diet history revealed a milk intolerance. Several family members were suffering from autoimmune diseases. During physical examination the patient exhibited clinical signs of osteoporosis(back pain, change of stature), but otherwise no pathological findings. LABORATORY FINDINGS: The technical examinations showed low bone mineral density at the spine. The routine laboratory examination (including serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase)was normal. However, further testing revealed low concentrations for 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, folic acid, vitamin B 12, an increased IgA and significantly elevated antigliadin antibodies and antiendomysial antibodies. Histopathological examination of the duodenal mucosa was in accordance with the diagnosis celiac sprue. The histopathologic examination of a transiliac bone biopsy exhibited high bone turnover, osteopenia, but no osteomalacia. DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY: Therefore, the diagnosis of celiac sprue with metabolic bone disease was established. Treatment with gluten-free diet and supplementation of calcium and vitamin D was initiated. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates that careful diagnostic evaluation of patients with osteoporosis is necessary,because therapeutic consequences are the result.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine potentially affecting all parts of the intestine with predilection sites in the terminal ileum and proximal colon. Its prevalence in Western Europe is 20-40/100,000 with equal affection of both sexes and familiar accumulation. Histopathologically, it is characterized by a discontinuous, segmental manifestation and implication of all intestinal layers. Celiac disease, on the other hand, is defined by histologically proven villous atrophy associated with hyperplasia of crypts, lymphocytic infiltration and clinical improvement after a gluten-free diet. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 52-year-old man presenting with long-term diarrhea and loss of weight associated with Crohn's disease. After interventional therapy for an unstable coronary artery syndrome and medical therapy for hyperthyroidism, the diarrhea stopped only after maintaining a gluten-free diet. A latent form of celiac disease (clinical symptoms, improvement after gluten-free diet, detection of anti-gliadin IgA antibodies, negative histology) was diagnosed. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report on the association of Crohn's disease and the latent form of celiac disease in the same patient. Whereas in most cases, Crohn's disease develops secondary to a pre-existing celiac disease, in our patient, latent celiac disease was diagnosed years after the onset of and therapy for Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of adult coeliac disease in The Netherlands was studied in the Dutch Coeliac Disease Society and in blood donors but not in the general population. We therefore studied the prevalence of recognized and unrecognized coeliac disease in a large cohort, representative of the adult Dutch general population. Blood samples were available for anonymous research, as well as data on dietary habits, self-reported physical characteristics, health problems, quality of life and socio-economic circumstances. METHODS: Subjects included 50,760 individuals who had previously participated in two large population-based studies on health status in relation to lifestyle factors. Recognized coeliac disease was studied in all subjects by identification of self-reported adherence to a gluten-free diet and subsequent confirmation of the diagnosis of coeliac disease. Unrecognized coeliac disease was studied in a random sample of 1440 out of the 50,760 subjects through serologic screening and human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) typing. RESULTS: The prevalence of recognized coeliac disease was 0.016% (95% confidence interval 0.008-0.031) and of unrecognized coeliac disease 0.35% (95% confidence interval 0.15-0.81). Menarcheal age was higher in women with recognized coeliac disease than in women without coeliac disease. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of adult recognized coeliac disease in The Netherlands is one of the lowest in Europe, while the prevalence of unrecognized coeliac disease is comparable with that in other European countries. Adult coeliac disease is strongly under diagnosed in The Netherlands. The higher menarcheal age in women with recognized coeliac disease may be explained by diagnostic delay.},

METHODS: Thirty patients with asymptomatic CD (17 children, 13 adolescents), on a gluten-free diet, and 23 healthy subjects were studied. BMD of the lumbar spine (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) was performed on all patients and control subjects. In patients, food diaries for nine nonconsecutive days were obtained and analyzed. In patients, laboratory tests pertaining to calcium balance were obtained. RESULTS: The mean weight and height of the adolescents with CD were lower than those of control subjects (weight: 45.8 +/- 10.5 kg v 55.3 +/- 10.5 kg, P = 0.037; height: 153.0 +/- 11.0 cm v 167 +/- 12.0 cm, P = 0.007). The mean BMD in adolescents with CD was significantly lower than that of the control subjects (0.917 +/- 0.116 g/cm2 v 1.060 +/- 0.158 g/cm2, P = 0.015), whereas no significant difference was found between children with CD and control subjects (P = 0.595). A multiple-regression model shows that increases in BMD relative to height were lower in adolescents with CD than in control subjects. The proportion of adolescents who had started a gluten-free diet after 2 years of age was higher than that of children with CD (P < 0.001). High percentages of magnesium, calcium, and phosphorous deficiencies were present in CD patients' diets. The serum levels of ionized and total calcium and parathormone were normal. CONCLUSIONS: The BMD of adolescents with CD was lower than that of the control subjects, whereas no difference was found between the BMD of children with CD and that of control subjects.},

   abstract = {The mucosal lesion in coeliac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated injury triggered by gliadin and associated with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. In view of this, an approach that re-induces tolerance to this antigen should be considered as possible alternative to a strict gluten-free diet in treating CD. However, T-cell activation to multiple antigens, as a consequence of the chemical complexity shown by the antigen gliadin, could hamper the efforts to identify single component(s) useful for tolerance induction. To address this issue, a recombinant alpha-gliadin was tested in tolerance experiments in HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice. As tissue transglutaminase (tTG) treatment of gliadin, previously reported to enhance its stimulatory activity in CD, did not increase its immunogenicity when parenterally administered in these mice, untreated gliadin was used as immunogen. A decrease in systemic T cell responses to the recombinant alpha-gliadin was found after nasal administration of antigen, reflected by lymphocytes proliferation assay. Interestingly, while the immunisation protocol induced transcription of both Th1 (IFN-gamma) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines, the tolerisation protocol down-regulated significantly only the IFN-gamma mRNA expression. More important, the recombinant alpha-gliadin induced a similar down-regulatory effect in mice immunised with a commercial preparation of wheat gliadin, that is a mixture of many different gliadin components. As the Th1 phenotype and the HLA-DQ8 molecule play a role in the pathogenesis of CD, our data underlined the potential usefulness of this recombinant protein for the immunomodulation of this disease.},

Such cases are reported under the title of gluten ataxia or of coeliac neuropathy. However, associations do not prove cause. Herein, a short review is made of the literature and the author's personal experience. Many unsolved questions remain. Gluten sensitivity is probably an immunological response in genetically susceptible individuals with or without enteropathy. Antigliadin antibodies are present in healthy adults, in some idiopathic ataxias and neuropathies. A gluten-free diet is effective on gastrointestinal but not on neurological symptoms. Whether antigliadin antibodies are elevated is more of a waiting classification than a definite diagnosis. Finally, the relationship between antigliadin antibodies and neurological diseases is very weak.},

AIM: To find the frequency of coeliac disease among patients diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: During a period of one year, irritable bowel syndrome patients referred to a university clinic in Tehran were studied. For each patient, an asymptomatic sibling was enrolled as control. Serological tests for coeliac disease were performed in all patients and controls. If positive, duodenal biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis. Patients subsequently diagnosed as coeliac disease were placed on a gluten free diet and re-evaluated after 6 months. RESULTS: One hundred and five cases of irritable bowel syndrome and 105 controls were enrolled. Coeliac disease was diagnosed in 12 of the irritable bowel syndrome patients and none of the controls. Eleven coeliac disease patients adhered to a gluten free diet. After 6 months, all 11 patients had significant improvement in symptoms and three were totally asymptomatic. Six allowed repeated endoscopy after 6 months of gluten free diet, of which five showed improvement in histological findings. CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease is a common finding among patients labelled as irritable bowel syndrome. In this sub-group, a gluten free diet may lead to a significant improvement in symptoms. Routine testing for coeliac disease may be indicated in all patients being evaluated for irritable bowel syndrome.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of CD among 100 Iranian patients with chronic non-bloody diarrhoea. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients with chronic non-bloody diarrhoea of more than 6 weeks attending an academic centre in Iran were enrolled. Patients with bloody diarrhoea and renal failure were excluded. IgA endomysial antibody (IgA EMA), IgA antigliadin antibody (IgA AGA), and total serum IgA were tested in all patients. Patients with negative IgA EMA were evaluated for other causes of chronic diarrhoea. Patients who had positive IgA EMA underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal biopsy. Patients with a positive IgA EMA were advised to follow a gluten-free diet (GFD) strictly for 6 months, and then clinical symptoms, serological and haematological tests were re-assessed. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients (55 men and 45 women) with chronic non-bloody diarrhoea were studied. Mean age of the patients was 31 years. Total serum IgA was in the normal range in all participants. Twenty patients (12/45 women; 8/55 men) had positive IgA EMA. Fourteen of them also had a positive IgA AGA. CD was diagnosed in 19 patients (19%). Small intestinal Crohn's disease, small intestinal lymphoma and idiopathic aetiology were the next. In patients with CD, after 6 months of a GFD, 15 patients (75%) had a complete clinical response, three patients (15%) had a good response, and one patient (5%) had a partial response. One patient did not follow a GFD. CONCLUSION: CD is the most common cause of adult chronic non-bloody diarrhoea in Tehran.},

   abstract = {Gastrointestinal food allergies are a spectrum of disorders that result from adverse immune responses to dietary antigens. The named disorders include immediate gastrointestinal hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis), oral allergy syndrome, allergic eosinophilic esophagitis, gastritis, and gastroenterocolitis; dietary protein enterocolitis, proctitis, and enteropathy; and celiac disease. Additional disorders sometimes attributed to food allergy include colic, gastroesophageal reflux, and constipation. The pediatrician faces several challenges in dealing with these disorders because diagnosis requires differentiating allergic disorders from many other causes of similar symptoms, and therapy requires identification of causal foods, application of therapeutic diets and/or medications, and monitoring for resolution of these disorders. This review catalogs the spectrum of gastrointestinal food allergies that affect children and provides a framework for a rational approach to diagnosis and management.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Celiac disease (CD/ Nontropicalsprue, gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is a malabsortive condition in which an allergic reaction to the cereal grain-protein gluten (present in wheat, rye and barley) causes small intestine mucosal injury. The onset is in the first four decades of life, with a female to male ratio of 2:1. It may be associated with a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations including cerebellar ataxia, epileptic seizures, dementia, neuropathy, myopathy and multifocal leucoencephalopathy. We report three patients with neurological manifestations related with CD: one with cerebellar ataxia, one with epilepsy and one with cognitive impairment. The diagnosis of CD was confirmed by serologic tests (antiendomysial and antigliadin antibodies) and biopsy of the small intestine. In two patients the neurological symptoms preceded the gastrointestinal abnormalities and in all of them gluten restriction failed to improve the neurological disability. CONCLUSION: CD should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis of neurological dysfunction of unknown cause, including ataxia, epilepsy and dementia. A gluten free diet, the mainstay of treatment, failed to improve the neurological disability.},

In this study, we examined the prevalence of IgG or IgA anti-tTG in sera from patients with elevated levels of IgM rheumatoid factors, which are autoantibodies reactive with the Fc portion of IgG. We report here on four cases of anti-tTG positivity for patients with elevated IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) without evidence of celiac sprue. The study population consisted of 65 patients (26 men, 39 women; mean age, 49 years; range 4 - 92 years) with elevated RF (>20 U/ml ), and 23 healthy subjects (12 men, 11 women; mean age, 46 years; range, 21 - 54 years). IgG and IgA anti- tTG levels were detected using a commercially available ELISA kit (Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Germany). Out of 65 patients, one (1.5%) and three (4.6%) patients were positive for IgG and IgA anti-tTG antibodies, respectively, and this was a higher frequency than occurred in healthy subjects (0/23). The clinical features of the four cases positive for IgG or IgA anti-tTG were as follows: The first case (female, 63 yrs) positive for IgA anti-tTG antibody suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, type II diabetes mellitus, iron deficiency anemia and gastric indigestion without symptoms of malabsorption. She denied any gluten sensitivity on her diet. Her esophagogastroduodenoscopic biopsy showed mucosal atrophy with no elongated crypts or infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria. The remaining three cases positive for anti-tTG antibodies had interstitial pneumonia, a herniated lumbar disc, and mild scoliosis, respectively. They all denied any malabsorption symptoms or gluten sensitivity. Jejunal biopsy could not be performed in all four cases.},

METHODS: Case records of all patients diagnosed as having adult celiac disease in the Gastroenterology unit of this hospital during January 1996 till December 2001 were reviewed. Celiac disease was diagnosed according to the revised ESPGAN criteria. Adult celiac disease was diagnosed if disease manifestations started after 15 years of age. All patients had a minimum of one-year follow up. RESULTS: The mean duration of illness in the 96 patients (mean [SD] age 32.9 [11.4] years; 50 men) diagnosed over the 6-year study period was 7.3 (2.4) years. Diarrhea was present is 67.7% of cases; 18.7% presented with refractory iron-deficiency anemia, and 9.4% with abdominal symptoms like flatulence and distension. Three patients presented with dysphagia and anemia and were diagnosed as having Plummer-Vinson syndrome. Ulcerative colitis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and aphthous ulcers were associated conditions. All patients had significant improvement in symptoms and hematological and biochemical parameters after dietary gluten restriction. CONCLUSION: Adult celiac disease is not rare and usually presents as diarrhea, abdominal distension and flatulence, and refractory anemia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inducible nitric oxide synthase is expressed in the small intestine of patients with coeliac disease. This produces increased plasma concentration of nitric oxide end products (NOx), most marked in those ingesting gluten. The time-course of change in NOx with a gluten-free diet (GFD) and its correlation with histology and coeliac serology were studied. METHODS: Fasting plasma NOx was determined by the Greiss reaction in 20 coeliac patients at diagnosis and 2, 4 and 6 months after commencing a GFD. Endomysial and gliadin antibodies were checked at the same time. Duodenal biopsies were taken at diagnosis and at 6 months, and then graded according to the Marsh classification. RESULTS: Plasma NOx fell rapidly following the introduction of a GFD (mean before GFD 95.8 microM to 61.5 microM at 2 months), and further still by 6 months (mean = 37.0 microM). Reductions at 2 and 6 months were statistically significant compared with baseline (P < 0.01 and P < 0.005, respectively: Wilcoxon signed ranks test). Plasma NOx was correlated with histological grade initially (P = 0.03: Kruskal-Wallis) but not after 6 months on a GFD (P = 0.24). Coeliac serology correlated poorly with histology. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma NOx falls rapidly following GFD in coeliac disease and is related to histological grade initially. However, values vary widely between individuals, which may limit its use as a clinical tool.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) may have undiagnosed celiac sprue (CS). Because the symptoms of CS respond to a gluten-free diet, testing for CS in IBS may prevent years of morbidity and attendant expense. We sought to determine whether this might be a cost-effective diagnostic strategy in IBS-D. METHODS: We used decision analysis to calculate the cost-effectiveness of 2 competing strategies in IBS-D: (1) start empirical IBS treatment and (2) perform serologic test for CS followed by endoscopic biopsy for positive tests. The base-case cohort had a CS prevalence of 3.4%, which was varied between 0% and 100% in sensitivity analysis. The outcome measure was cost per symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Under base-case conditions, testing for CS instead of starting empiric IBS therapy cost an incremental $11,000 to achieve one additional symptomatic improvement. Testing for CS became the dominant strategy when the prevalence of CS exceeded 8%, the specificity of CS testing exceeded 98%, or the cost of IBS therapy exceeded $130/month. The incremental cost-effectiveness of testing for CS exceeded $50,000 when the prevalence fell below 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for CS in patients with IBS-D has an acceptable cost when the prevalence of CS is above 1% and is the dominant strategy when the prevalence exceeds 8%. The decision to test should be based on a consideration of the population prevalence of underlying CS, the operating characteristics of the screening test employed, and the cost of proposed therapy for IBS.},

Underlying conditions are thought to be Takayasu's arteritis, von Recklinghausen's disease, and connate hypoplasia. Celiac disease is an inflammation in the small intestine, triggered by an allergic reaction to gluten. It is known to be associated with a variety of other autoimmune disorders, e.g., dermatitis herpetiformis (Duhring's disease), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and IgA nephropathy. We describe the case of a young woman who presented with claudication of the lower limbs, therapy-refractory arterial hypertension, and untreated celiac disease. We found a midaortic syndrome, characterized by severe stenosis of the infrarenal aorta, of both renal arteries (more pronounced on the right side) and of the inferior mesenteric artery. We assume that-after having excluded other possible pathogeneses-the underlying condition is a local vasculitis in the abdominal aorta and the renal and mesenteric arteries due to the chronic inflammation of untreated celiac disease. We performed a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty together with implantation of two stents into the infrarenal aorta and the right renal artery and started treating the celiac disease by dietary intervention. The patient is now under regular medical control and observation.},

   abstract = {The problem of the interference of celiac disease (CD) with the male reproductive system is made evident both by the recognized adverse effects on female reproduction and by the multifactorial nature of the disease. It is important to consider CD as a multifactorial condition since its diverse effects can be modulated, besides gluten, by different concurrent genetic and environmental factors. The male CD patient has a greater risk of infertility and other reproductive disturbances, as well as a greater incidence of hypoandrogenism. In this paper the problems of CD associated to endocrine disorders and to deficiencies of micronutrients are discussed. Affected males show a picture of tissue resistance to androgens. Moreover, attention should be paid to increases of FSH and prolactin; these are not associated to infertility and/or impotence, but they may indicate an imbalance at hypothalamus-pituitary level, with general effects on health: an example is the increased risk of male osteoporosis in CD patients. Hormone alterations are reversible upon start of the gluten-free diet, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis; this should be performed in the case of clinical suspicion, e.g., unexplained hypoandrogenism. As regards nutritional aspects, the folic acid deficiency of CD can affect rapidly proliferating tissues, such as the embryo and the seminiferous epithelium. More attention should be paid to deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins, such as A and E, observed in CD. Vitamin A is important for Sertoli cell function as well as for early spermatogenetic phases. Vitamin E supports the correct differentiation and function of epidydimal epithelium, spermatid maturation and secretion of proteins by the prostate. Therefore, CD male patients should be considered as vulnerable subjects; thus, the detection of early biomarkers of andrological or endocrinological dysfunctions should trigger timely strategies for prevention and treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A protective effect of breast-feeding against the development of celiac disease has been described, but the nature and effects of the actual milk components have not been established. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), a milk cytokine affecting the proliferation and differentiation of mucosal epithelial cells, was studied as to its potential protective effect on the damage of intestinal mucosa by gliadin in a model system. METHODS: Enteropathy was induced by gliadin in inbred AVN strain rat pups delivered by cesarean section, breast-fed, or hand-fed a milk formula. All experimental groups were treated with interferon-gamma (1,000 U per animal, administered intraperitoneally) after birth. Gliadin (0.5 and 3 mg) was intragastrically administered to the pups on days 0 and 3, and a 30-mg challenge dose was given on day 20 (24 hours before the termination of the experiment). One group of artificially fed pups received EGF (100 ng/ml) continuously in the diet. RESULTS: Gliadin- and interferon-gamma-treated formula-fed rat pups showed villus atrophy, increase of inflammatory cells, including CD4+ T lymphocytes in the lamina propria, and damage to epithelial tight junctions and the enterocyte brush border. Morphometrically, the villus height was significantly less than in other groups. Recombinant EGF was markedly increased in the epithelial cells of injured jejunum. The intestinal mucosa of gliadin- and interferon-gamma-treated pups kept on a EGF-supplemented artificial diet resembled that of breast-fed pups. CONCLUSION: Pathologic changes in jejunal mucosa (villus atrophy and inflammation) resembling gliadin-induced atrophy appeared on administration of interferon-gamma and gliadin to rat pups fed an artificial milk diet immediately after birth. Addition of EGF to the diet protected the rats against pathologic mucosal changes.},

   abstract = {In several studies oats have been reported to be tolerated by coeliac patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the nutritional and symptomatic effects of including oats in the gluten-free diet, as well as the patients' subjective experiences. Twenty adult coeliac patients included large amounts of oats in their diet. Food intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, blood samples and body weight were examined and compared with examination at baseline. Diet compliance was checked monthly. The results are based on fifteen patients eating oats for 2 years plus three with only 6-months consumption. The median daily intake of oats was 93 (range 27-137) g/d, and the compliance was good. The mean intakes of Fe and dietary fibre increased (P<0.001) with the oat diet, as well as the intakes of thiamin and Zn (P<0.02). The bioavailability of Fe tended to decrease; this seems not to have influenced the Fe status. Temporary increased flatulence was experienced the first few weeks, as well as improved bowel function with oats in the diet. All patients who carried out the whole study period wanted to continue eating oats after the study, as they found that addition of oats in the gluten-free diet gave more variation, better taste and satiety. Oats improved the nutritional value of the gluten-free diet, had no negative effects on nutritional status and were appreciated by the subjects. Including oats can help coeliac patients following a strict gluten-free diet.},

DESIGN, SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty adult coeliac patients in remission included large amounts of uncontaminated rolled oats in their daily diet for a prolonged period. The examinations, performed four times during the study period, included small bowel endoscopy with biopsies, blood samples (nutritional status, serological analysis), height and body weight, gastrointestinal symptoms and dietary records. Gastrointestinal symptoms and diet were also investigated through unannounced telephone interviews once a month during the study period. RESULTS: No adverse effects of a large intake of oats were seen in small bowel histology, serology nor in nutritional status in the 15 subjects who completed the whole study period. Two of the subjects dropped out because of gastrointestinal symptoms and three for non-medical reasons. The median intake of oats was 93 g/day and the compliance to the oat diet was found to be good. Examinations of the patients after drop-out did not show any deterioration in small bowel histology or nutritional status nor raised levels of antibodies. CONCLUSION: Results from this study indicate that adult patients with coeliac disease in remission can include large amounts of controlled wheat-free rolled oats for an extended period of time without adverse effects.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by atrophy of the intestine villi triggered by ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The association between celiac disease and low BMD has been recognized, but the mechanisms of disturbance are poorly understood. We show imbalance of cytokines relevant to bone metabolism in celiac patients' sera and the direct effect of these sera on in vitro bone cell activity. INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease is associated with mineral metabolism derangement and low BMD. We investigated whether imbalance of serum factors in celiac patients could affect human bone cell activity in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied two groups of celiac patients--one on a gluten-free diet and another before the diet--both with decreased bone mass. Patients were investigated for bone turnover markers, and their sera were used for culturing bone cells from healthy donors and evaluate changes in cell activity. RESULTS: The N-terminal telopeptide of procollagen type I and interleukin (IL)-6 were higher than normal in patients not on the gluten-free diet. IL-1beta and TNF-alpha/beta were normal in all patients. IL-12 was reduced in all patients, whereas IL-18 was reduced only in patients on the diet. The RANKL/osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio was increased in patients not on the gluten-free diet. Persistently increased osteoclast numbers were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors on incubation with sera of patients not on the gluten-free diet versus control sera and sera from patients on the diet. In human osteoblasts from healthy individuals, IL-18 was reduced on incubation with sera from all patients, whereas OPG expression was lower when sera from patients not on the diet were used. Proliferation, alkaline phosphatase, and nodule mineralization were increased in osteoblast cultures containing sera from all celiac patients, either on or not on the gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that bone loss in celiac disease might also be caused by a cytokine imbalance directly affecting osteoclastogenesis and osteoblast activity.},

   abstract = {Whether oats should be included in a gluten-free diet has been debated for half a century. In 1995, the largest and most scientifically rigorous study on the safety of oats was published. Investigators concluded that the consumption of oats was safe for adults with celiac disease. Since 1995, several additional studies have been published. Without exception, these investigations found no adverse effects associated with the regular consumption of moderate amounts of oats. However, there are concerns among some authorities on celiac disease that even if oats themselves are safe, they nonetheless may be contaminated with wheat, rye, or barley. Unfortunately, the extent to which contamination of commercial oat products occurs is not known. Ideally, if a patient appears likely to use oats, they should be advised to consume only those products tested and found to be free of contamination.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) is a characteristic skin condition seen in the presence of a pancreatic glucagonoma. The presence of NME in the absence of a pancreatic tumor has been termed the pseudoglucagonoma syndrome. In such cases, NME is commonly associated with conditions, such as liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, malabsorption disorders (ie, celiac sprue), and other malignancies. There are many theories on the pathogenesis of NME, which include the direct action of glucagon in inducing skin necrolysis, hypoaminoacidemia-inducing epidermal protein deficiency and necrolysis, a nutritional or metabolic deficiency of zinc or essential fatty acids, liver disease, glucagon induction of inflammatory mediators, a substance secreted from pancreatic and other visceral tumors associated with NME, and generalized malabsorption. OBJECTIVE: To present a review of the literature on the clinical presentation, etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of NME. DESIGN: Review of the literature on NME occurring in patients both with and without a pancreatic glucagonoma. METHODS: We performed a PubMed review of the literature on the etiology and pathogenesis of NME to identify case reports and reviews published in both the internal medicine and dermatology literature. RESULTS: Our literature review encompassed 17 primary case reports and literature reviews published in the dermatologic and internal medicine literature on NME in patients both with and without a pancreatic glucagonoma. Although we found no clear consensus among the investigators of a universally accepted pathogenesis for NME, we did identify 4 main categories of etiologic/pathogenetic mechanisms for NME (glucagon excess, nutritional deficiencies, inflammatory mediators, and liver disease) that were discussed by many of the investigators and validated by both clinical and scientific evidence. CONCLUSION: The exact pathogenesis and treatment of NME remain ill-defined despite many case reports and studies on NME in the literature. The many systemic diseases and nutritional deficiencies that have been found to be associated with NME suggest a multifactorial model for the pathogenesis of the disease. The most comprehensive, postulated mechanism for NME involves a combination of zinc, amino acid, and fatty acid deficiencies (arising from a wide variety of causes, such as dietary insufficiency, malabsorption syndromes, liver disease, elevated glucagon levels, and disorders of metabolism) that contributes to increased inflammation in the epidermis in response to trauma and to the necrolysis observed in NME. The importance of gaining an understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of NME lies in the fact that there is no universally accepted mechanism of pathogenesis for NME, and that the only treatment reported to resolve the rash in these patients is to adequately identify and treat the underlying associated systemic condition or nutritional deficiency.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To determine coeliac disease prevalence by an anti-transglutaminase antibody assay in a large paediatric population; to evaluate acceptance of the screening programme, dietary compliance, and long term health effects. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 3188 schoolchildren (aged 6-12) and prospective follow up of diagnosed cases. Main outcome measures were: prevalence of coeliac disease defined by intestinal biopsy or positivity to both human tissue transglutaminase and anti-endomysium antibodies in HLA DQ2-8 positive subjects; percentage of children whose families accepted screening; dietary compliance as defined by negativity for anti-transglutaminase antibodies; and presence of clinical or laboratory abnormalities at 24 month follow up. RESULTS: The families of 3188/3665 children gave their consent (87%). Thirty biopsy proven coeliacs were identified (prevalence 1:106). Three other children testing positive for both coeliac related autoantibodies and HLA DQ2-8 but refusing biopsy were considered as having coeliac disease (prevalence 1:96). Of 33 cases, 12 had coeliac related symptoms. The 30 biopsy proven coeliacs followed a gluten-free diet. Of 28 subjects completing 18-24 months follow up, 20 (71.4%) were negative for anti-transglutaminase antibodies, while eight were slightly positive; symptoms resolved in all 12 symptomatic children. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of coeliac disease is high in Italian schoolchildren. Two thirds of cases were asymptomatic. Acceptance of the programme was good, as was dietary compliance. Given the high prevalence and possible complications of untreated coeliac disease, the availability of a valid screening method, and evidence of willingness to comply with dietary treatment population mass screening deserves careful consideration.},

The aim of this multicentre study was to evaluate the impact of a new immunoenzymatic assay for the detection of IgA anti-tGT antibodies. METHODS: Seventy four Italian and French clinical laboratories participated in this study; anti-tTG IgA with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method using guinea pig liver extract as the coating antigen, anti-endomysium IgA autoantibodies (EMA), and total serum IgA were determined in 7948 patients, 1162 of whom had coeliac disease (737 untreated cases and 425 on a gluten free diet). A proportion of the sera were then sent to a reference laboratory for anti-tTG retesting with an ELISA method using recombinant human tTG antigen. RESULTS: Seven thousand four hundred and fifty eight (93.8%) sera were EMA/antiguinea pig tTG concordant (positive or negative); 490 (6.2%) were non-concordant. The sensitivity of EMA and antiguinea pig tTG in the 737 untreated patients with coeliac disease was 92.1% and 94.8%, respectively, and the specificity was 99.8% and 99.2%, respectively. Retesting of the discordant sera showed that of the 162 sera classified as EMA negative/antiguinea pig tTG positive, only 49 were positive for human recombinant anti-tTG, and that 39 of these were also EMA positive. Furthermore, of the 36 sera classified as EMA positive/antiguinea pig tTG negative, only two were confirmed as EMA positive. CONCLUSIONS: The antiguinea pig tTG assay is more sensitive but less specific than EMA, whereas the antihuman recombinant tTG assay is far more specific and just as sensitive as antiguinea pig tTG. Testing for EMA presents considerable interpretative problems and is difficult to standardise.},

Among several causes of nonresponsiveness, enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma is most important because of its almost invariably rapid lethal outcome. We present the case of a 44-year-old patient with refractory celiac disease complicated by unusually severe malabsorption. Repeated duodenal biopsies disclosed normal and slightly shortened villi, focal crypt hypertrophy, and a moderate increase of intraepithelial lymphocytes consistent with celiac disease, but unable to explain the severe malabsorption. To rule out cryptic lymphoma, push enteroscopy was done providing 21 biopsies taken along the entire jejunum. Surprisingly, about 70% of the biopsies were composed of gastric glands covered by nonabsorptive-type, strongly periodic acid-Schiff-positive surface epithelium and showed a villous architecture. Alternating with the gastric mucosa, there were areas of flat mucosa with elongated crypts and occasional erosions. Irrespective of the type of surface epithelium, intraepithelial lymphocytes were increased with counts up to 80/100 epithelial cells. Despite harboring an aberrant immunophenotype, overt T-cell lymphoma was ruled out histologically and by lack of monoclonality, as tested by polymerase chain reaction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of refractory celiac disease complicated by extensive jejunal gastric heterotopia, which might have contributed to the severe malabsorption.},

   abstract = {We present a patient with Fabry disease with remarkable diagnostic findings and gluten-sensitive enteropathy. An 11-year-old girl was admitted to hospital with weight loss, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, flank pain, acroparesthesia, and painful extremities. Her mother had end-stage renal failure secondary to Fabry disease. On physical examination, she had growth retardation. Ophthalmological examination showed characteristic whorl-like corneal opacities and Fabry disease was confirmed with low alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-gal A) activity. Her painful attacks were treated with carbamazepine, but vomiting and nausea continued. Laboratory studies revealed positive serum anti-endomysium and anti-gliadin antibodies. Small intestinal biopsy showed subtotal villous atrophy compatible with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Following treatment with a gluten-free diet, her gastrointestinal symptoms completely disappeared within a few weeks and then she had catch-up growth. In her long-term follow-up, proteinuria appeared and renal involvement was confirmed by characteristic renal biopsy findings. Following these clinicopathological findings, enzyme replacement therapy was started. In conclusion, although heterozygous females can be asymptomatic or are expected to have a mild course of the disease, a severe clinical course in our patient in the 2nd decade is of particular interest. In addition, Fabry disease occurring with gluten-sensitive enteropathy, a very rare co-existence, is emphasized.},

   abstract = {It is quite frequent to recognize celiac patients who show gastrointestinal motor abnormalities in clinical practice. In fact, in 30 to 60% of patients, physical examination and dyspeptic symptoms (epigastric discomfort, early satiety) suggest a gastrointestinal motility disorder. Consistent data are now available on the presence of a disturbed motility of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, gallbladder, and colon of untreated celiac patients. Gastrointestinal abnormalities differ in different gastrointestinal districts. In fact, esophageal transit, gastric and gallbladder emptying, and orocecal transit time are delayed, while colonic transit is faster. These findings are related to the complex interactions among reduced absorption of food constituent (in particular, fat), neurologic alteration, and hormonal derangement. Motility disorders of the gut are also a predisposing factor in the development of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and may contribute both to development of symptoms in some untreated celiacs and to the persistence of symptoms after gluten-free diet in some of them. All these alterations fortunately disappear after gluten-free diet, and patients return to well being status. Whatever the initial event in the pathogenesis of the celiac lesions may be, we know for certain at this time that gastrointestinal disturbances play an important role in the genesis of gastrointestinal symptoms in celiac disease and that surveillance for celiac disease in patients complaining of dysmotility-like dyspeptic symptoms should be increased.},

   abstract = {GOALS: A clinical problem is posed by patients with symptoms suggestive of gluten sensitivity (diarrhea, weight loss, unresponsive iron-deficiency anemia, etc.); however, small intestinal biopsies reveal only minor abnormalities, such as lymphocytosis with or without crypt hyperplasia (Marsh I-II). Our aim was to assess the benefit of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in patients with these small bowel mucosal abnormalities. STUDY: We studied 35 patients (11 men, 24 women; mean age, 28 years; range, 22-51 years) referred to us for gastrointestinal symptoms or unexplained or unresponsive diseases. Because celiac disease was suspected to be the underlying pathology, small intestinal biopsies were taken. These revealed only minor abnormalities: 11 patients showed Marsh I type lesions, whereas 24 patients demonstrated Marsh II type lesions. Although the histologic lesions were inconsistent for celiac disease and a suspicion of a borderline celiac disease persisted, all patients were motivated to adhere to GFD. RESULTS Only 23 patients adhered to our advice and followed a GFD; follow-up biopsies were taken after 8 to 12 months. In the Marsh I lesion group (seven patients), five patients showed mucosal normalization to Marsh 0 and two showed persistence of Marsh I lesions. In the Marsh II lesion group (16 patients), 9 patients revealed mucosal normalization, 5 improved to a Marsh I lesion, and 3 revealed persistence of Marsh II lesions. A dramatic clinical improvement in symptoms was noted in all patients who were on a GFD, with symptoms virtually disappearing in all patients. Seven patients who refused GFD were reevaluated 8 to 12 months later. Symptoms and histologic lesions were unchanged in six, all of whom refused again to adhere to a GFD. One of the seven with Marsh I lesions had a worsening of symptoms and of histologic lesions (from Marsh I to Marsh IIIa); so, this last patient adhered to a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms disappeared after GFD in patients suspected to have celiac disease but with slight histologic lesions. Although Marsh I-II lesions cannot be classified as celiac lesions (ESPGAN criteria), the patients' symptoms at presentation and the clear improvement of symptoms when on GFD, with or without improvement of histologic lesions, supports the assumption that these patients are sensitive to gluten and may justify treatment with a GFD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestation, and most celiac patients respond to a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, in some rare cases celiacs continue to experience GI symptoms after GFD, despite optimal adherence to diet. The aim of our study was to evaluate the causes of persistence of GI symptoms in a series of consecutive celiac patients fully compliant to GFD. METHODS: We studied 15 celiac patients (five men, 10 women, mean age 36.5 yr, range 24-59 yr) who continued to experience GI symptoms after at least 6-8 months of GFD (even if of less severity). Antigliadin antibody (AGA) test, antiendomysial antibody (EMA) test, and sorbitol H2-breath test (H2-BT), as well as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with histological evaluation, were performed before starting GFD. Bioptic samples were obtained from the second duodenal portion during EGD, and histopathology was expressed according to the Marsh classification. To investigate the causes of persistence of GI symptoms in these patients, we performed AGA and EMA tests, stool examination, EGD with histological examination of small bowel mucosa, and sorbitol-, lactose-, and lactulose H2-breath tests. RESULTS: Histology improved in all patients after 6-8 months of GFD; therefore, refractory celiac disease could be excluded. One patient with Marsh II lesions was fully compliant to his diet but had mistakenly taken an antibiotic containing gluten. Two patients showed lactose malabsorption, one patient showed Giardia lamblia and one patient Ascaris lumbricoides infestation, and 10 patients showed small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) by lactulose H2-BT. We prescribed a diet without milk or fresh milk-derived foods to the patient with lactose malabsorption; we treated the patients with parasite infestation with mebendazole 500 mg/day for 3 days for 2 consecutive wk; and we treated the patients with SIBO with rifaximin 800 mg/day for 1 wk. The patients were re-evaluated 1 month after the end of drug treatment (or after starting lactose-free diet); at this visit all patients were symptom-free. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that SIBO affects most celiacs with persistence of GI symptoms after gluten withdrawal.},

   abstract = {Gluten-free diet (GFD) plays a key role in the treatment of celiac disease (CD), but it is difficult to evaluate the effect of GFD on the improvement of villous architecture using sensitive, non-invasive tests. Aim of this study is to evaluate anti-transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies in the follow-up of CD to detect histologic recovery. We studied 42 consecutive patients with CD. In all the patients anti-tTG antibodies (evaluated by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay method) and EGDscopy with multiple bioptic samples before GFD and then 6, 12, and 18 months after GFD were evaluated. For comparison, a sorbitol H2-breath test (H2-BT) and anti-endomysium (EMA) antibodies test were carried out concomitantly. Anti-tTG results were positive in 36 of 42 patients before GFD (80.95%), while they were positive in 11 of 34 (32.35%), 1 of 17 (5.88%), and 0 of 6 (0%) of patients with a persistence in histologic lesions 6, 12, and 18 months of GFD respectively, without any correlation with persistence of histologic lesions (P = NS). Also EMA failed to show correlation with improvement of histologic lesions. They were positive in 31 of 42 patients before GFD (73.80%), while they were positive in 18 of 34 (52.94%), 3 of 17 (17.64%), and 0 of 6 (0%) cases 6, 12, and 18 months of GFD respectively (P = NS). Regarding sorbitol H2-BT, it was positive in 40 of 42 (95.24%) patients before GFD, while it was positive in 31 of 34 (91.17%), 13 of 17 (76.47%), and 4 of 6 (50%) of patients with a persistence in histologic lesions 6, 12, and then 18 months after GFD starting (see Fig. 2, infra). So, anti-tTG and EMA were ineffective in assessing the histologic recovery at each follow-up visit (P = NS), while sorbitol H2-BT seems more effective than anti-tTG and EMA in this field (P < 0.0001 sorbitol H2-BT versus anti-tTG and versus EMA at 18 months after gluten withdrawal). Thirty-eight of 42 (90.47%) patients adhered to a strict GFD. Four patients were found to have occasional dietary transgression, and in all we noted a progressive decreasing of anti-tTG after 6 months of GFD and negative anti-tTG after 12 months of GFD, but sorbitol H2-BT persisted being positive during the entire follow-up. Intestinal damage persisted during the follow-up, despite anti-tTG and EMA negativity, and worsened in the presence of dietary lapses. Anti-tTG does not seem effective to assess histologic recovery in the follow-up of celiac patients after they have started GFD due to its poor correlation with histologic damage.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Since brain perfusion abnormalities have been described by single-photon emission computed tomography in some autoimmune diseases, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of perfusion abnormalities by brain single-photon emission computed tomography in a group of coeliac disease patients, and to investigate whether gluten intake and associated autoimmune diseases may be considered risk factors in causing cerebral impairment. METHODS: Thirty-four adult coeliac patients (16 on a gluten-free diet and 18 on a gluten-containing diet, 18 (53%) with autoimmune diseases) underwent 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer brain single-photon emission computed tomography and qualitative evaluation of brain perfusion was performed together with a semiquantitative estimation using the asymmetry index. Ten subjects on our database, matched for sex, age and ethnic group, who were proved normal by histology ofjejunal mucosa (four males and six females; median age 39 years, range 27-55 years), were included as control group. RESULTS: Twenty-four out of 34 patients (71%) showed brain single-photon emission computed tomography abnormalities confirmed by abnormal regional asymmetry index (>5%; range 5.8-18.5%). Topographic comparison of the brain areas showed that the more significant abnormalities were localised in frontal regions, and were significantly different from controls only in coeliac disease patients on unrestricted diet. The prevalence of single-photon emission computed tomography abnormalities was similar in coeliac disease patients with (74%) and without (69%) associated autoimmune disease. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities of brain perfusion seem common in coeliac disease. This phenomenon is similar to that previously described in other autoimmune diseases, but does not appear to be related to associated autoimmunity and, at least in the frontal region, may be improved by a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Strict lifelong compliance to a gluten-free diet (GFD) minimizes the long-term risk of mortality, especially from lymphoma, in adult celiac disease (CD). Although serum IgA antitransglutaminase (IgA-tTG-ab), like antiendomysium (IgA-EMA) antibodies, are sensitive and specific screening tests for untreated CD, their reliability as predictors of strict compliance to and dietary transgressions from a GFD is not precisely known. We aimed to address this question in consecutively treated adult celiacs. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 95 non-IgA deficient adult (median age: 41 yr) celiacs on a GFD for at least 1 yr (median: 6 yr) were subjected to 1) a dietician-administered inquiry to pinpoint and quantify the number and levels of transgressions (classified as moderate or large, using as a cutoff value the median gluten amount ingested in the overall noncompliant patients of the series) over the previous 2 months, 2) a search for IgA-tTG-ab and -EMA, and 3) perendoscopic duodenal biopsies. The ability of both antibodies to discriminate celiacs with and without detected transgressions was described using receiver operating characteristic curves and quantified as to sensitivity and specificity, according to the level of transgressions. RESULTS: Forty (42%) patients strictly adhered to a GFD, 55 (58%) had committed transgressions, classified as moderate (< or = 18 g of gluten/2 months; median number 6) in 27 and large (>18 g; median number 69) in 28. IgA-tTG-ab and -EMA specificity (proportion of correct recognition of strictly compliant celiacs) was 0.97 and 0.98, respectively, and sensitivity (proportion of correct recognition of overall, moderate, and large levels of transgressions) was 0.52, 0.31, and 0.77, and 0.62, 0.37, and 0.86, respectively. IgA-tTG-ab and -EMA titers were correlated (p < 0.001) to transgression levels (r = 0.560 and R = 0.631, respectively) and one to another (p < 0.001) in the whole patient population (r = 0.834, N = 84) as in the noncompliant (r = 0.915, N = 48) group. Specificity and sensitivity of IgA-tTG-ab and IgA-EMA for recognition of total villous atrophy in patients under a GFD were 0.90 and 0.91, and 0.60 and 0.73, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In adult CD patients on a GFD, IgA-tTG-ab are poor predictors of dietary transgressions. Their negativity is a falsely secure marker of strict diet compliance.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There is currently much call for a reliable enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol for determining gluten in foods to serve as a basis for further Codex Alimentarius regulations. Given its ability to recognize the potential coeliac-toxic epitope QQPFP, which occurs repeatedly in alpha-, gamma- and omega-gliadins, hordeins and secalins, the monoclonal antibody R5 raised against a secalin extract may prove to be an essential tool for gluten analysis. This study was designed to develop a highly sensitive and specific sandwich ELISA to quantify low levels of wheat, barley and rye prolamins in foods for coeliacs. METHODS: Simple sandwich ELISA based on the use of a single monoclonal antibody (R5) as both the coating and detection was developed. A quantitative cocktail gluten-extraction procedure for heat-processed foods was also tested. RESULTS: R5-ELISA was able to identify gliadins, hordeins and secalins with assay sensitivities of 0.78, 0.39 and 0.39 ng/ml, respectively. The assay's detection limit was 1.5 ng gliadins/ml (1.56 ppm gliadins, 3.2 ppm gluten). The system proved insensitive to the non-coeliac-toxic cereals maize, rice and oats, and was non-cultivar-dependent. It was also able to detect gliadins and hordeins in unprocessed and heat-processed wheat- and barley-based products, and to estimate the gluten content of hydrolysed foods. CONCLUSION: We present a new generation of a robust sandwich R5-ELISA with good reproducibility (8.7%) and repeatability (7.7%). Its gluten-detection limit of 3.2 ppm is lower than the existing threshold of 20-200 ppm. The ELISA, which is equally sensitive to barley, wheat and rye prolamins, is compatible with the quantitative cocktail extraction procedure for heat-processed foods. Along with the cocktail procedure, the Working Group on Prolamin Analysis and Toxicity is currently evaluating an R5-ELISA system as proposed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission.},

The aim of the study was to compare the behaviour of anti-tTG and anti-endomysium antibodies assays in coeliacs and in patients with chronic liver disease. METHODS: 34 patients (24 women, 34.9 +/- 12.5 years) with coeliac disease and 41 with chronic liver disease (14 women, 57 +/- 11.2 years), including 19 cirrhotics, were evaluated for anti-endomysium antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence and for anti-tTG IgA antibodies by ELISA, using guinea pig liver or human recombinant transglutaminase. RESULTS: The prevalences of anti-tTG and anti-endomysium antibodies were 100% in patients with coeliac disease at diagnosis, 75% and 64.3% in patients on a gluten-free diet. All liver disease patients were negative for anti-endomysium antibodies, while 11 (26.8%) were positive for anti-tTG. All these patients had liver cirrhosis and represented 57.9% of all cirrhotics. The presence of anti-tTG was associated with higher Child-Pugh scores. The use of human transglutaminase determined a reduction in the rate of positive results; however, the rate of positive anti-tTG was still 17.1% in all liver disease patients and 31.6% in cirrhotics. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that anti-tTG have a similar sensitivity compared with anti-endomysium antibodies assay in coeliacs. However, a high prevalence of positive anti-tTG results is observed in cirrhotic patients, even when human recombinant tTG is used. The high prevalence of positive results among cirrhotic patients is associated with more advanced liver disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have shown that celiac disease is being diagnosed at a progressively later age. This paper analyses trends in age at diagnosis in a closed island population. METHODS: Patient case notes of all known patients with celiac disease were retrieved and demographic information, mode of presentation including symptomatology and diagnostic criteria were obtained. Over the period 1985 to 2000, information was available on 42 patients with celiac disease. All were aged 14 years. RESULT: The mean age at diagnosis showed an increasing age, with a constant disease incidence. A highly significant positive correlation was found for age at diagnosis with time (rho=0.4, p=0.009). CONCLUSION: It is thought that breast feeding, with later introduction of gluten containing products in the diet, leads to a later presentation of celiac disease. In Malta, over the period under study, the breast feeding rate rose from 20% to 60%. Our findings support the hypothesis that breast feeding offers a degree of protection against the early development of celiac disease, without actually reducing the incidence of the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac patients are at high risk of developing insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, a condition that has a long pre-diabetic period. During this lapse, anti-islet cell antibodies serve as markers for future disease. This may be related with the duration of the exposure to gluten. AIM: To test the hypothesis that long term adherence to a gluten free diet decreases the frequency of risk markers for insulin dependent diabetes mellitus during adolescence and early adulthood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 158 celiac patients were classified as: G1, (n=30 patients) studied at the time of diagnosis; G2 (n=97 patients) exposed to gluten as a result of non compliance with the gluten free diet and, G3 (n=31 patients) who had maintained a long term, strict gluten free diet. Isotype IgG anti-islet cell antibodies were detected by indirect immunofluorescence using monkey pancreas, results were reported in Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) units. RESULTS: Celiac patients exposed to a gluten containing diet had a significantly higher prevalence of anti-islet cell antibodies than those who had been exposed only briefly (p < 0.017). In addition, a significantly higher prevalence of anti-islet cell antibodies was observed in those patients whose exposure to gluten was longer than 5 years than in those whose exposure was shorter (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Celiac patients long exposed to gluten have a significantly higher prevalence of anti-islet cell antibodies than those exposed for a short period. This fact supports the hypothesis that the development of these antibodies is associated with the length of the exposure to gluten.},

AIMS: To investigate the distribution of the abnormal and monoclonal IEL population in the digestive tract of RCS patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the frequency of lymphocytic gastritis (LG) and lymphocytic colitis (LC), together with IEL phenotype and T cell clonality, in gastric and colonic samples from 15 adults with RCS (all with aberrant CD3 intracytoplasmic(+) surface(-) CD8(-) clonal IELs on duodenojejunal biopsies), 18 patients with active coeliac disease (ACD), and 10 patients with coeliac disease (CD) on a gluten free diet (GFD-CD) by means of immunohistochemistry and multiplex polymerase chain reaction amplification of the T cell receptor gamma gene (TCR-gamma) rearrangement. Blood samples of nine RCS patients were also tested for clonality. RESULTS: LG was found in 9/14 (64%), 11/18 (61%), and 3/10 (30%) patients with RCS, ACD, and GFD-CD, respectively, while LC was found in 6/11 (55%), 3/4 (75%), and 2/3 (66%) patients. Contrary to CD, all samples from patients with LG and LC showed an aberrant IEL phenotype. Monoclonal TCR-gamma rearrangements were detected in 8/13 (62%), 8/10 (80%), and 4/9 (44%) of gastric, colonic, and blood samples, respectively, from RCS patients, while in CD patients such rearrangements were only found in 2/25 (8%) gastric samples. CONCLUSION: The immunophenotypically aberrant monoclonal IEL population present in the small intestine of patients with RCS frequently disseminates to the blood and the entire gastrointestinal epithelium, suggesting that this is a diffuse gastrointestinal disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tissue transglutaminase is the major autoantigen recognized in the sera of coeliac patients. An enzyme-linked immune-adsorbed assay based on tissue transglutaminase was recently used to measure serum tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulins A for coeliac disease diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: To determine the sensitivity, the specificity, the positive and negative predictive values of an immunoenzymatic assay based on guinea pig tissue transglutaminase, to compare antititransglutaminase immunoenzymatic assay to the antiendomysium immunofluorescent assay, and to define a cost-effective sequence to execute serum antibody determination in coeliac patients. METHODS: We assessed for coeliac disease antibodies 91 pediatric patients with symptoms suggestive of coeliac disease, and 23 patients with coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet as controls. RESULTS: Antitransglutaminase immunoglobulins A showed 93.1% sensitivity, 93.6% specificity, 87.1% positive and 96.7% negative predictive values. Antitransglutaminase immunoglobulins A were significantly higher in antiendomysium positive subjects. Correlation between antitransglutaminase immunoglobulins A and antigliadin immunoglobulins A was not significant. DISCUSSION: Our results show that antitransglutaminase immunoenzymatic assay represents a cost-effective strategy for patients' serological evaluation and it could substitute EMA determination, which could be considered a second level evaluation.},

   abstract = {Osteoporosis is a frequent complication in the course of various gastrointestinal disorders. Since its pathogenesis is complex, and incompletely understood in comparison to the well-known pathomechanism of postmenopausal osteoporosis, adequate management is difficult. We first summarize those therapeutic options which have strong evidence in postmenopausal osteoporosis and, thereafter, we review those in the context of different gastrointestinal diseases. Treatment of the underlying intestinal disorder seems to be most important to normalise altered bone metabolism and to prevent osteoporosis in patients with coeliac disease. In patients with osteoporosis associated with Crohn's disease, various treatment strategies (such as vitamin D, sodium fluoride, bisphosphonates) are discussed. In contrast to postmenopausal osteoporosis, interventional studies in secondary osteoporosis are often limited by the small study population and data about the efficacy of any treatment in prevention of fractures are therefore lacking. Well-conducted, controlled studies with the endpoint of preventing fractures are therefore required to optimise the treatment of osteoporosis in these patients.},

AIMS: We set out to investigate the prevalence of these lesions and their associations with other gastric and duodenal histopathological lesions. PATIENTS: A total of 1255 consecutive patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were recruited into the present study. METHODS: Two biopsy specimens were obtained from each of the following sites: duodenal bulb, gastric antrum, gastric body, and distal to the superior duodenal angle. These specimens were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, alcian blue periodic acid Schiff (pH 2.5) and modified Giemsa (Heliobacter pylori infection was determined only by histology). RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 57 years, and male:female ratio 1:1.6. Overall, 235 (19%) had gastric metaplasia and/or chronic inflammation in the duodenal bulb mucosa, and H. pylori organisms could be found in 17 (1%). In univariate analyses, gastric metaplasia and/or chronic duodenal bulb inflammation positively associated with male sex (p = 0.046), Heliobacter pylori-positive chronic gastritis (p = 0.033), villous atrophy of distal duodenal mucosa, i.e., coeliac disease (p < 0.001), duodenal ulcer (p < 0.001), and duodenal bulb deformity and scarring in endoscopy (p < 0.001), but not with age (p = 0.7) nor use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (p = 0.055). Multivariate analysis revealed that independent risk factors for gastric metaplasia and chronic inflammation in duodenal bulb were duodenal Heliobacter pylori infection (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval CI 1.1-2.1), and villous atrophy of the distal duodenal mucosa (odds ratio 12.7, 95% CI 4.4-36.5), while chronic atrophic gastritis was protective against them (odds ratio 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to Heliobacter pylori infection, duodenal bulb gastric metaplasia and chronic inflammation may result from predisposition to toxic dietary components in gluten-sensitive subjects.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is an enteropathy associated with dietary gluten which occurs in individuals with a genetic predisposition. The pathogenesis remains obscure although it is clear that only certain parts of the gliadin molecule are toxic and there is considerable evidence of immunological activity, including antibody production. In this issue of European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Carton et al. present evidence in favour of an inherent depletion of CD4CD8 T cells, which could result in a loss of oral tolerance to ingested gliadin. Using flow cytometry they also demonstrated that the classic T-cell infiltration of coeliac disease is not due to an increase in T cells but is an apparent increase associated with a relative decrease in enterocytes as a result of the change in architecture of the mucosa. These could be important fundamental observations in helping to unravel the pathogenesis of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of celiac disease is based in clinical features, serology and intestinal biopsy. There are recent reports that antiglutaminase antibodies have a good correlation with anti endomisial antibodies. AIM: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of antitransglutaminase antibodies in the diagnosis of celiac disease and their correlation with antiendomisial antibodies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty nine patients with celiac disease (mean age 30 years, 12 male) were studied. Thirty were symptomatic and 19, asymptomatic. As controls, 34 subjects (mean age 27 years, seven male), with normal duodenal biopsies, were studied. Sera was processed for the determination of antigliadin IgA by ELISA, antiendomisium IgA by indirect immunofluorescence, and antitransglutaminase IgA by ELISA. RESULTS: Antigliadin antibodies had a sensitivity of 73%, a specificity of 96%, a positive predictive value of 93% and a negative predictive value of 82% for the diagnosis of celiac disease. Antiendomisium and antitransglutaminase antibodies had a specificity and positive predictive value of 100%, sensitivities of 89 and 92% respectively and negative predictive values of 92 and 94% respectively. No significant differences in the diagnostic yield of antiendomisium and antitransglutaminase antibodies, were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In this group of patients, antitransglutaminase antibodies had a high concordance with antiendomisium antibodies, for the diagnosis of celiac disease. Considering that the determination of antitransglutaminase antibodies is of lower cost and less complicated than antiendomisium antibodies, it is a useful tool for the diagnosis and follow up of patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that vascular disease mortality may be reduced in coeliac disease because of lower levels of blood pressure, cholesterol and body mass. AIM: To examine whether people with coeliac disease are at reduced risk of various vascular diseases. METHODS: We identified 3,790 adults with diagnosed coeliac disease and 17,925 age- and sex-matched controls in the General Practice Research Database. We estimated odds ratios for diagnosed hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and atrial fibrillation and hazard ratios for myocardial infarction and stroke. RESULTS: Adults with coeliac disease, compared with controls, were less likely to have had a diagnosis of hypertension [11% vs. 15%, odds ratio 0.68 (95% confidence interval: 0.60-0.76)] or hypercholesterolaemia [3.0% vs. 4.8%, odds ration 0.58 (95% confidence interval: 0.47-0.72)] but slightly more likely to have had atrial fibrillation [2.1% vs. 1.7%, odds ratio 1.26 (95% confidence interval: 0.97-1.64)]. The hazard ratio for myocardial infarction was 0.85 (95% confidence interval: 0.63-1.13), while the hazard ratio for stroke was 1.29 (95% confidence interval: 0.98-1.70). CONCLUSIONS: Although rates of myocardial infarction and stroke were not substantially different, adults with coeliac disease do have a lower prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia compared with the general population. The effect of a gluten-free diet on cardiovascular risk factors should be determined before any screening programmes for coeliac disease are instituted.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: During the past 2 decades, celiac disease (CD) has been recognized as a multisystem autoimmune disorder. A growing body of distinct neurologic conditions such as cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, myoclonic ataxia, chronic neuropathies, and dementia have been reported, mainly in middle-aged adults. There still are insufficient data on the association of CD with various neurologic disorders in children, adolescents, and young adults, including more common and "soft" neurologic conditions, such as headache, learning disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and tic disorders. The aim of the present study is to look for a broader spectrum of neurologic disorders in CD patients, most of them children or young adults. METHODS: Patients with CD were asked to fill in a questionnaire regarding the presence of neurologic disorders or symptoms. Their medical charts were reviewed, and those who were reported as having neurologic manifestations underwent neurologic examination and brain imaging or electroencephalogram if required. Their neurologic data were compared with that of a control group matched for age and gender. RESULTS: Patients with CD were more prone to develop neurologic disorders (51.4%) in comparison with control subjects (19.9%). These disorders include hypotonia, developmental delay, learning disorders and ADHD, headache, and cerebellar ataxia. Epileptic disorders were only marginally more common in CD. In contrast, no difference was found in the prevalence of tic disorders in both groups. Therapeutic benefit, with gluten-free diet, was demonstrated only in patients with transient infantile hypotonia and migraine headache. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the variability of neurologic disorders that occur in CD is broader than previously reported and includes "softer" and more common neurologic disorders, such as chronic headache, developmental delay, hypotonia, and learning disorders or ADHD. Future longitudinal prospective studies might better define the full range of these neurologic disorders and their clinical response to a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Ferulic acid (FA) is one of the most abundant phenolic antioxidants in the human diet. Many studies have documented its beneficial properties. It is therefore essential to understand the absorption and metabolism of FA in detail. The purpose of this study was to confirm the hypothesis that FA is absorbed in rat stomach and metabolized mainly in the liver. We determined the recovery of FA and its metabolites (FA sulfate/glucuronides) in rat gastric contents, gastric mucosa, portal vein plasma, celiac arterial plasma, bile, and urine after 2.25 micromol FA was administered in 0.5 mL physiological saline and incubated for 25 min in situ in the stomach of rats. Within 25 min, 74 +/- 11% of the administered FA disappeared from the stomach; later, FA was recovered in both free and conjugated forms in plasma, bile, and urine. On the other hand, only free FA was detected in the gastric contents and mucosa; it was also detected in the portal vein plasma as 49 +/- 5% of the total FA (all forms of FA). However, the proportion of free FA in the celiac arterial plasma, bile, and urine decreased to 5-8%. These results indicate that FA can be quickly absorbed from the rat stomach, and then is likely metabolized mainly in the liver. Such novel information would be helpful in the use of FA as a nutrient supplement. For example, oral administration of FA in capsule form or in a form bonded with sugar esters may provide a more appropriate concentration of FA in the circulation, which may improve its proposed efficacy in preventing chronic disease.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Dietary factors modifying type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) risk have been proposed, but little is known if they trigger the islet autoimmunity that precedes clinical disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether breastfeeding duration, food supplementation, or age at introduction of gluten-containing foods influences the risk of developing islet autoantibodies. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective natural history cohort study conducted from 1989 to 2003 in inpatient/outpatient clinics in Germany. PARTICIPANTS: The BABYDIAB study follows newborn children of parents with type 1 DM. Eligibility requirements were met in 1610 children. Blood samples were obtained at birth, age 9 months, 2, 5, and 8 years. Dropout rate was 14.4% by age 5 years. Breastfeeding data were obtained by prospective questionnaires (91% complete), and food supplementation data were obtained by family interview (72% for food supplementation and 80% for age of gluten introduction). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Development of islet autoantibodies (insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, or IA-2 antibodies) in 2 consecutive blood samples. RESULTS: Life-table islet autoantibody frequency was 5.8% (SE, 0.6%) by age 5 years. Reduced total or exclusive breastfeeding duration did not significantly increase the risk of developing islet autoantibodies. Food supplementation with gluten-containing foods before age 3 months, however, was associated with significantly increased islet autoantibody risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-11.5; P =.01 vs children who received only breast milk until age 3 months). Four of 17 children who received gluten foods before age 3 months developed islet autoantibodies (life-table 5-year risk, 24%; SE, 10%). All 4 children had the high-risk DRB1*03/04,DQB1*0302 genotype. Early exposure to gluten did not significantly increase the risk of developing celiac disease-associated autoantibodies. Children who first received gluten foods after age 6 months did not have increased risks for islet or celiac disease autoantibodies. CONCLUSION: Ensuring compliance to infant feeding guidelines is a possible way to reduce the risk of development of type 1 DM autoantibodies.},

   abstract = {Although it generally does not improve performance, iron is often used by elite athletes. The physiologic changes induced by exercise can mimic iron deficiency and decrease hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations. Determination of serum transferrin receptor concentrations may identify true iron deficiency, which occurs particularly in young athletes. In contrast, increased iron stores in the body are a frequent finding in elite athletes who have used long-term iron supplementation. Elite runners have increased intestinal blood loss, but this usually can be compensated by enhanced absorption of dietary iron. The combination of exercise-induced hemolysis with enhanced intestinal blood loss in various endurance sports leads to severe abnormalities of routine tests, and extreme physical activity may be responsible for positive fecal occult blood determinations. Indiscriminate iron supplementation carries the risk of inducing hemochromatosis in individuals homozygous for the widespread C282Y allele of the HFE gene. This polymorphism is common and can be found in about 1% of individuals of Northern European descent; moreover, iron supplementation can modify the presentation of important underlying diseases such as celiac disease or colon carcinoma. In conclusion, iron supplements should be prescribed for athletes with iron-deficiency anemia and carefully monitored if given for prophylaxis; unless a therapeutic response occurs, investigations to establish the cause of iron deficiency should be initiated.},
