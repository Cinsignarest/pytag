   abstract = {A total of 167 children and adolescents with insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetes mellitus (97 males; age range 1.9-22.4 yrs) in a UK paediatric diabetic clinic were screened for coeliac disease using the IgA endomysial (EMA) test, or, in IgA deficient subjects, the IgG antigliadin (AGA) test. Antibody positive subjects were selected for small bowel biopsy, and confirmed coeliac cases started on a gluten free diet. Clinical features, height (Ht) standard deviation score (SDS), body mass index (BMI) SDS, HbA1c, insulin requirements' haemoglobin (Hb), mean red cell volume (MCV), serum folate and ferritin levels were evaluated at diagnosis and thereafter at 3-6 month intervals. A total of 156 subjects (93.4%) were antibody negative. Eleven (6.6%) were antibody positive (10 EMA/1 AGA; 6 males), of whom 9 had biopsies: 1 normal: 8 coeliac (4.8%; 5 males; 1 'classical'; 1 anaemia; 3 'atypical'; 3 asymptomatic). Seven coeliac subjects were followed during 12-24 months of dietary therapy. Pretreatment mean (range) Ht SDS = 0.08 (-1.66 to 1.88); BMI SDS = 0.32 (-0.82 to 1.29); HbA1c = 8.9 (6.2 to 11.3%); insulin dose = 0.98 (0.51 to 1.29) U kg(-1) day(-1). During treatment antibody status reverted to and remained negative, and symptoms resolved. By 24 months, there was a trend towards increased BMI SDS (mean (range) 1.31 (0.47 to 2.29), p = 0.248) and to reductions in HbA1c (8.1 (6.4-10.8), p = 0.697). Repeat small bowel biopsies were normal in 6 subjects (1 refused). No statistically significant changes occurred in any other parameters. In conclusion, serological screening is effective, although the therapeutic benefit of dietary therapy in asymptomatic cases remains uncertain.},

Under fasting conditions, celiac patients showed peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity, mean velocity, and flow volume values significantly higher than those of normal subjects, whereas resistive index was significantly lower. After saccharose ingestion these parameters showed greater variations in normal subjects than in celiac patients. Fasting end diastolic velocity turned out to be the best parameter to distinguish celiac patients from healthy subjects. Doppler ultrasonography of the superior mesenteric artery could discriminate between normal subjects and celiac patients with overt disease. However, these data need further confirmation given the limited sample that we studied; moreover, the capability of this technique in distinguishing nontropical sprue from other gastrointestinal diseases that cause increasing splanchnic flow remains to be ascertained.},

METHODS: Duodenal biopsy was performed in nine children (all with short stature, five with chronic diarrhea and three with hepatosplenomegaly of unknown etiology) with a possible diagnosis of gluten sensitive enteropathy. All of the patients had different abnormalities in serum aminotransferase levels. With the help of laboratory investigations, viral, autoimmune, metabolic and toxic etiologies which cause hepatic damage were excluded. Liver biopsy was performed in five of these patients, two showing fibrosis and three nonspecific reactive changes. Gliadin antibodies were measured in six cases. RESULTS: Intestinal mucosal histopathology was compatible with gluten sensitive enteropathy in all patients. While immunoglobulin (Ig) G gliadin antibodies were positive in all cases, only three cases were found to have positive IgA gliadin antibodies. After a gluten-free diet, levels of transaminases fell to normal within 3 months and remained so in seven of these patients. A second intestinal biopsy, which was performed after 1 year of gluten-free diet revealed normal intestinal mucosa in all patients. CONCLUSION: Gluten sensitive enteropathy should be considered when evaluating a child with elevated levels of serum transaminase and in cases with cryptogenic liver disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The detection and evaluation of steatorrhea in a rapid, quantitative fashion are clinically needed in patients with suspected steatorrhea. Our aim was to evaluate the acid steatocrit method, on random spot stools in adults with and without steatorrhea, relative to the qualitative (microscopic) and quantitative assessments for fecal fat. METHODS: Stool samples were collected 72 h after a diet of 100 g of fat per day and randomly from 15 healthy controls, 14 patients with chronic pancreatitis, and seven patients with small bowel disease. All stools had quantitative, qualitative, and acid steatocrit analyses performed for fecal fat. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity for the detection of steatorrhea by the spot stool qualitative fecal fat were 78 and 70%, respectively. The spot stool acid steatocrit correlated linearly with the 72-h stool quantitative fecal fat (g/24 h), r = 0.761 and p < 0.001. The acid steatocrit on random spot stools, compared with the 72-h stool quantitative fecal fat, revealed a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 95%, and a positive predictive value of 90% for the detection of steatorrhea. It also estimated the quantitative fecal fat. CONCLUSIONS: The acid steatocrit can be performed accurately on random spot stools and can be used to detect the presence of steatorrhea and estimate the quantitative fecal fat. This assay can be done with readily available equipment for rapid evaluation. Use of a spot stool sample simplifies the acid steatocrit, further improving on the practicality of this test. This study also confirms the clinical usefulness of this simplified method to detect steatorrhea.},

   abstract = {In the pathogenesis of coeliac disease, disturbed immunological processes play a basic role. This is also proved by immunohistochemical findings in the jejunal mucosa of patients with this disorder, which are discussed in this review. Intraepithelial lymphocytes are increased in number in active coeliac disease, most being of the CD8 subpopulation. The counts of lamina propria lymphocytes and the relative numbers of their subsets are comparable to those in healthy controls, but several studies have indicated that the densities of IgA, IgM and IgG immunoglobulin-containing cells in the lamina propria are increased in untreated coeliac disease. Activated T cells can also be found in the lamina propria of patients on gluten-containing diets. In the crypt epithelial cells of coeliac patients on normal diets, strong expression of HLA Class II antigens can be observed. All of these changes are normalized on a gluten-free diet. It was recently discovered by the authors and others that one of the hallmarks of coeliac disease, both active and treated, is an increase in number and proportion of gamma/delta intraepithelial T lymphocytes. The permanent increase of gamma/delta T cells may facilitate identification of a coeliac patient also when an intestinal biopsy is taken on a gluten-free diet and other morphologic signs are normalized. The detection of elevated numbers of intraepithelial gamma/delta T cells is also an indispensable help in the diagnosis of latent coeliac disease.},

METHODS: A total of 248 EMA results were reviewed and compared with small bowel biopsy results in 66 patients who had undergone both tests. Regression analysis was used to look for predictors of positive EMA results and positive biopsy results. A cost minimization model from a societal perspective was used to evaluate the cost differences among three different strategies. RESULTS: EMAs had a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 64%. The only predictor of a positive biopsy result that reached statistical significance was a positive EMA. The strategy of EMA as a diagnostic test for celiac disease was the most expensive strategy, with a cost of $3,174 per patient assessed. The strategy of small bowel biopsy for all patients had a cost of $997, and a strategy of EMA followed by small bowel biopsy for positive patients had a cost of $866 per patient. The results were sensitive to cost of a gluten-free diet, the specificity of the EMA and the cost of a small bowel biopsy. CONCLUSION: The EMA is best used as a screening test from both a clinical and cost perspective.},

METHODS: Bone mineral density was assessed at baseline and after a mean duration of 37 months of treatment in 25 unselected newly diagnosed coeliac patients. RESULTS: At baseline, osteopenia (> -1 s.d. below normal) was evident in the lumbar spine and total skeleton in 18 (72%) and 21 (84%) patients, respectively. At the end of the study, bone density had increased (mean bone mass Z-score increase: Z-score +1.0 for the lumbar spine and +1.1 for total skeleton) in 22 and 23 patients, respectively. Patients who adhered to strict gluten restriction (n = 15) demonstrated a similar bone remineralization in the spine than those patients with partial compliance (n = 10) (mean Z-score increase: +1.0, in both areas). A greater mean annual change in Z-score in the total skeleton was noted in patients who followed strict gluten restriction (0.4 +/- 0.1) respect to those with partial compliance (0.3 +/- 0.1); however, this difference was not statistically significant. Pre-menopausal women had significantly greater remineralization that post-menopausals (P > 0.05). Remineralization showed an inverse correlation with the degree of basal osteopenia (r = -0.525; P < 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with gluten-free diet produces a significant improvement in bone density in coeliac patients. Remineralization was more pronounced in patients who better comply with gluten-free diet, in pre-menopausal women and in patients with the lowest baseline bone mineral density.},

The pathophysiologic origin of these symptoms is not clearly understood. Theories invoking either a neurogenic or vascular origin for the clinical features associated with MALS have been proposed, but objective evidence to support these theories is lacking. We describe the clinical course and gastric myoelectrical features of a patient with postprandial epigastric pain, weight loss, gastroparesis, and gastric dysrhythmias in whom a diagnosis of MALS was established. Surgical decompression of the celiac axis in our patient resulted in resolution of abdominal pain, return to a full diet within 4 weeks without nausea or vomiting, improvement in radionuclide gastric emptying, and restoration of the gastric electrical rhythm to a normal 3 cycle/min conduction rate. This is the first demonstration of altered gastric myoelectrical activity in a patient with MALS. The regularization of the gastric electrical rhythm in our patient after surgical decompression of the celiac axis would support a neurogenic basis for the symptoms associated with MALS. MALS should be excluded in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis and unexplained epigastric pain.},

Coeliac disease was diagnosed by duodenal biopsy and response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The results were compared with age and sex-matched patients with non-specific upper gastrointestinal symptoms and normal duodenal histology. While the levels of serum IL-10 were significantly elevated (P < 0.01) in patients with coeliac disease taken as a whole, the levels of serum IFN-gamma were normal and sCD23 significantly decreased (P < 0.002). The median serum sCD23 was significantly lower in the coeliac disease patients not on a GFD compared with those asymptomatic on a GFD (P < 0.03) and the control group (P < 0.0004). The coeliac disease patients on a GFD also had significantly lower serum sCD23 and higher IL-10 compared with the control group (P < 0.01 and P < 0.015). There was no significant difference in the serum IL-10 between the coeliac disease patients on a GFD and those not on a GFD and between the latter and the control group. The low levels of serum sCD23 in coeliac disease suggest diminished humoral immunity and, conversely, exaggerated cellular immunity. The aetiology of the raised levels of IL-10 in coeliac disease is unclear and similar to that observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. However, this may represent a regulatory response to the elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines described in coeliac disease. A combination of diminished sCD23 and raised IL-10 is clearly unusual as both are associated with Th2-type functions. The possible causes of this finding are discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between diabetes mellitus and coeliac disease has been known for many years. In a random group of 175 insulin dependent diabetes mellitus patients of varying ages the following tests have been carried out: serum antigliadin antibodies (AGA) of IgA and IgG class, antireticulin antibodies (ARA) and antiendomisyum antibodies (AEA), both of IgA class. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients, 85 males and 90 females, had ages ranging from 1 yr to 30 yrs (102 in paediatric age--mainly between 6 and 14 years--and 73 adults). Patients with pathological values for AEA and/or ARA underwent an intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: Out of 175 patients studied, 21 had pathological values for AEA with or without pathological values for ARA and AGA, and 2 patients had only pathological values for ARA. 23 patients (21 with pathological values for AEA with or without ARA and AGA, 2 only for ARA ) underwent intestinal biopsy, all patients with pathological values for AEA had villous atrophy. The prevalence of coeliac disease among IDDM patients was 8.8% (95% CI 3.3 to 14.3) for the children and 16.4% (95% CI 7.9 to 24.9) for the adults. In patients with mucous atrophy, ARA, AGA IgA and IgG were pathological in 85%, 71% and 61% respectively. Symptoms and insulin requirements in all patients affected by coeliac disease before and after one year on a gluten free diet were also evaluated. The patients had clinical features with prevalently one or only few atypical symptoms which disappeared on a gluten free diet. Insulin requirements after one year on a gluten free diet appeared unchanged in coeliac patients. CONCLUSIONS: The need to screen all diabetic patients for coeliac disease is underlined.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An association between celiac disease and primary biliary cirrhosis has been reported in a few cases, mainly as individual case reports. OBJECTIVES: To screen adult patients with celiac disease for primary biliary cirrhosis and patients with primary biliary cirrhosis for intestinal celiac involvement. METHODS: The celiac group consisted of 336 adults (218 women and 118 men; mean age, 36 yr; range 18-74 yr) with celiac disease diagnosed by serological and histological tests, 38 with newly diagnosed celiac disease and 298 with previously diagnosed celiac disease who were consuming a gluten-free diet. The mean follow-up period was 6 yr (range, 1-16 yr). Liver function parameters and autoantibody levels were determined, and, when indicated, histological tests were performed. The biliary cirrhosis group consisted of 65 subjects (58 women and seven men) (mean age, 59 yr; range, 35-67 yr) with primary biliary cirrhosis diagnosed 1-17 years previously (mean, 7 yr) on the basis of the usual biochemical, serological, and histological criteria. Antigliadin and antiendomysium antibody levels were determined, and two biopsy specimens from the distal duodenum obtained during endoscopy were evaluated. RESULTS: In patients with celiac disease, impairment of liver function was frequently found at diagnosis (16 of 38, or 44%), but primary biliary cirrhosis was diagnosed in only one case. In patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, no cases of celiac disease, as currently defined, were found. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that celiac disease and primary biliary cirrhosis are rarely associated and support the hypothesis that the intestinal lesions per se are not responsible for the liver disease.},

The marrow donor was his HLA-identical sister, who had suffered from celiac disease since birth. The post-transplant period was characterized by recurrent episodes of diarrhea. Detailed workup showed atrophic intestinal mucosa on histology and anti-gliadin and anti-endomysium antibodies in the serum, features that were not present before transplantation. GVHD was absent at that time. The patient remains free of symptoms on gluten-free diet and slight immunosuppression. This case suggests transmission of celiac disease by bone marrow transplantation and supports the T cell concept in celiac disease.},

The diagnosis of CD was established on the basis of ESPGAN criteria (1969). 5-15 years ago. Antigliadin antibodies, IgG-, and IgA-AGA (by fluorescence enzyme immunoassay), Gliastick by ELISA technique, and Anti-endomysium antibodies (by indirect immunofluorescence on sections of monkey esophagus) were examined in the serum. Only 5 patients had no antigliadin or anti-endomysium antibodies. In 21 cases the IgG-AGA showed positive results; the IgA-AGA was positive in 6, the Gliastick in 19, and the anti-endomysium antibodies in 8 cases. The main cause of the mismanagement of the diet was inadequate food labeling; so it seems to be important to also establish a Food Intolerance Data Bank in Hungary. The 5 sero-negative children volunteered for a gluten challenge; 3 of them became positive in a few weeks or months. Two patients remained negative even after 1 year. Their gluten sensitivity may not prove to be permanent.},

   abstract = {The pattern of spontaneous lipid deposition around aortic branch ostia was mapped in New Zealand White rabbits aged 1 month or 2 to 6 years. The young rabbits were studied within 1 day of weaning, and the older rabbits had been maintained on a low-protein, low-fat diet. Plasma concentrations of total cholesterol for the two groups averaged 75 and 18 mg/dL, respectively. Aortas were fixed in situ at a pressure of 90 to 100 cm H2O, stained with oil red O, and photographed en face under an epifluorescence microscope. Areas of staining contrasted in color with the fixative-stimulated autofluorescence of nondiseased tissue and were mapped by placing grids over the photomicrographs. Disease around intercostal ostia was rare, but two distributions were established by combining data from many branches. In weanlings, staining was seen within a triangular area downstream of the branch. In old animals, this area had the lowest frequency of disease; lesions tended to occur downstream of the spared region, along axes lying to either side of it, and at the lateral and upstream margins of the ostium. Disease was less rare at celiac branches. It occurred mainly downstream of the ostium in weanlings, whereas upstream sites were most affected in old animals, although significant disease remained at the juvenile locations. Earlier reports have described similar age-related distributions of disease in human aortas, consistent with a common underlying mechanism. The distributions also correlate with the spatial variations in arterial transport properties established in previous studies, and may be determined by them.},

However, notwithstanding patient' belief about 'allergies' related to food stuffs, only a minority of them have actually such a diagnosis substantiated. Moreover, the diagnostic approach to these problems is cumbersome and unsatisfactory, and the objectivation of a food hypersensitivity is often difficult. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For these reasons we studied by means of small bowel manometry a small group of patients with food hypersensitivity, and showed abnormal fasting and postprandial findings in those with the gut as a target organ on clinical grounds. RESULTS: Manometric abnormalities were somewhat similar to those previously described in celiac disease, a well recognized food allergy disease. The possible usefulness of this technique in the investigative approach of food hypersensitivity is discussed.},

Hyperthyroidism was diagnosed and he was treated with thyrostatic drugs. INVESTIGATIONS: Referred to our clinic, fT4 concentration, determined by routine ELISA, was found to be raised to 33.9 pmol/l, while fT3 and TSH levels were within normal limits. But the equilibrium-dialysis method gave a normal serum level also for fT4. Gastroscopy suggested coeliac disease, confirmed histologically. TREATMENT AND COURSE: The symptoms quickly improved on a gluten-free diet and the fT4 level returned to normal values even on routine measurement. CONCLUSION: The raised fT4 level with non-suppressed TSH was only revealed as a false finding by special non-routine laboratory methods. The reversibility and the close time relationship of the reported laboratory data with the clinical manifestations of the concomitant coeliac disease strongly suggested that changes in serum in the course of the latter disease played a role in these misleading laboratory results. An interference of coeliac disease with some laboratory tests has been previously described.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short stature is one of the features of Turner syndrome and a form of presentation of monosymptomatic celiac disease. METHODS: The recognition of celiac disease in two antiendomysium antibody-positive Turner syndrome girls who did not respond to growth hormone treatment led us to perform as a screening for celiac disease IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies and antiendomysium antibodies determination in other 35 Turner syndrome patients. Intestinal biopsy was proposed to the antiendomysium antibodies-positive girls; in the former, subtotal villous atrophy was found; in the latter, one parent's consent for intestinal biopsy was not obtained. RESULTS: The prevalence of celiac disease in Turner syndrome patients observed in the present study (8.1 if we consider 3 villous atrophy, 10.8 if we consider 4 antiendomysium antibody-positive) is quite high and seems to indicate that the association of these two disorders could not be coincidental. As to the clinical picture, celiac disease appeared atypical in one case, typical in another one and as a silent form in the third case. Of the 3 cases with villous atrophy on gluten-free diet growth hormone therapy was not effective in two girls, who were older than 16 years, while in the younger patient, detected by the screening, a significant increment of height velocity and height Standard Deviation Score for Chronological Age according to Turner references was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that celiac disease can be associated with Turner syndrome and even responsible for a failure of growth hormone therapy. Therefore we propose to perform in Turner syndrome patients antiendomysium antibody determination as a screening followed by intestinal biopsy in positive cases. This would be advisable at least before starting growth hormone treatment.},

   abstract = {Genetics of human diseases has passed through three main historical phases: (1) studies of formal genetics aimed at investigating mechanisms of inheritance using Mendelian models in population, family and twin surveys; (2) studies of associations between HLA antigens and diseases; and (3) direct mapping of genes through candidate gene or random genomic search approach. Very few data in each of these three phases are available for food allergy and intolerance. They are mostly confined to formal genetics studies of allergy in general and to HLA association studies in celiac diseases. The main reason for paucity of data in this important area of investigation is represented by the heterogeneity of the clinical entities grouped under the label of food allergy at the level of: (1) the clinical phenotype, because of the many diseases and end-organs interested; (2) pathophysiological variables involved, since several immunological and non-immunological mechanisms can be invoked in different cases of food allergy and intolerance; and (3) the foods or their absorbed metabolites which induce symptoms. However, progress made in genetics of allergy can be in part extrapolated to the limited number of cases where an IgE-mediated mechanism has been demonstrated. The review of studies based on a more punctual definition of the allergic phenotype and of the candidate genes (regions) of allergy: (1) suggests that allergen recognition and specific IgE response, total IgE (and IgG4) polyclonal activation, up-regulation of inflammatory cells (mast cells and eosinophils mainly) and hyper-responsiveness of end-organs are possibly regulated by different genetic and environmental factors; and (2) calls particular attention on the following genomic regions: 5q31.1-33, 6p21.3, 11q13,14. Research on genetics of food allergy and intolerance is highly recommended because of its high prevalence and of the potential applicative value of results for preventive measures of dietary control in subjects at risk. Since `food allergy and intolerance' does not represent an useful phenotype for genetic studies because of its heterogeneity, adequate strategies of gene mapping should be designed in study groups selected for defined variables with a well established role in the pathogenesis of the different clinical expressions of this common condition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Age at onset and clinical presentation of celiac disease have often been related to the age of gluten introduction into the diet. It has also been shown that breast feeding delays the onset of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study attempts to evaluate the respective contributions of these two parameters in the determination of the age at onset of the symptoms in celiac Tunisian children. RESULTS: One-hundred-sixty-nine children were studied. Mean duration of breast feeding in our population was 9.6 +/- 8.9 months and mean age of gluten introduction was 5.6 +/- 3.2 months. The mean age at onset of the disease was 15 +/- 8.7 months and mean latency time between gluten introduction and onset of the disease was 9.5 +/- 7.8 months. Both variables, duration of breast feeding and age at gluten introduction were strongly correlated to the age at onset of the disease (r = 0.47 and 0.40, respectively). Only breast feeding was correlated to the variable latency time (r = 0.33). Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the two variables independently influenced the age at onset with coefficients of regression of 0.90 +/- 0.20 and 0.26 +/- 0.07, respectively. Only breast feeding influenced the latency time with a coefficient of regression equal to 0.26 +/- 0.07. DISCUSSION: Our study confirms the independent effect of breast feeding in the determination of the age at onset of the disease. Breast feeding has two effects: an indirect effect, by delaying the introduction of gluten, and a direct effect, by increasing the latency time between gluten introduction and onset of the disease. CONCLUSION: Prolonged breast feeding, at least until the 6th month, and gluten introduction started at least at the 5th month of life, significantly delay the onset of the disease. Gluten introduction should be done progressively and under breast feeding protection. Introduction of gluten 2 months before weaning has a protective effect.},

The method is based on the direct observation of the characteristic avenin mass pattern, around 20-30 kDa, as revealed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF-MS). The mass range where avenin signals appear is free from mass peaks arising from wheat gliadin, barley hordein and rye secalin protein components, which are also toxic to coeliac patients. Therefore, avenins can easily be screened in complex formula food samples elaborated with mixtures of wheat, barley, rye and oats. In addition, a procedure to quantify avenins in food samples is described on the basis of avenin mass area measurement with a detection limit of 0.4 mg of avenins per 100 g of food.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac patients often have nutrient malabsorption with nutritional status impairment, but no report on their energy requirements is available. In this study body composition, dietary habits, basal energy expenditure, and substrate oxidation were investigated in patients with the classic form of coeliac disease. METHODS: Sixteen untreated and 18 adult coeliac patients on a gluten-free diet participated in the study. Body composition was assessed by anthropometry and bioimpedance. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry. A food diary over 7 days was collected. RESULTS: Coeliac patients showed reduced body weight components but not a different fat-free mass percentage compared with age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Basal metabolic rate normalized by fat-free mass (BMR/FFM) was higher in coeliac patients than in controls. Untreated patients showed a significantly higher non-protein respiratory quotient with regard to both treated patients (P < 0.01) and controls (P < 0.05), an increased percentage of carbohydrate intake, and a good correlation between lipid faecal loss and carbohydrate oxidation (Spearman R = 0.74; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Both groups of patients had lower fat mass and FFM content than controls. The preferential carbohydrate oxidation in untreated patients might be a result of both lipid malabsorption and high carbohydrate intake.},

   abstract = {We assessed the clonality of duodenal mucosal T cells in patients with celiac disease and controls. Fifteen adult patients were studied. Four patients had a complicated celiac disease, 3 did not respond to a gluten-free diet, and 2 had an ulcerative jejunitis (including 1 patient with nonresponsive celiac disease). Seven patients had an untreated celiac disease responsive to a gluten-free diet. Histological examination of duodenal biopsies of these 11 patients showed benign-appearing celiac disease without evidence of lymphoma. Four patients with nonulcer dyspepsia and normal duodenal biopsies served as controls. TCRgamma gene rearrangements were analyzed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction on DNA extracted from duodenal biopsies. Major clonal rearrangements of the T-cell receptor were found in 4 cases, all with complicated celiac disease. Monoclonality was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the junctional region in 3 cases and by hybridization with clone-specific oligoprobes. Patients with celiac disease responsive to gluten-free diet had mainly a polyclonal pattern, with 1 of them having an oligoclonal rearrangement. An oligoclonal pattern was also observed in 2 control patients. Three patients with complicated celiac disease evolved to T-cell lymphoma with liver (n = 2) or bone marrow (n = 1) invasion. Identical clones were found in the enteropathic duodenojejunum and peripheral blood in the patient with large-cell lymphoma with bone marrow invasion. This study suggests that complicated celiac disease is a cryptic T-cell lymphoma.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutrient malabsorption frequently occurs in HIV infected children, but very few studies have investigated exocrine pancreatic digestive capacity in these cases. AIMS: To investigate pancreatic function in HIV infected children and to determine whether faecal fat loss, a prominent feature of intestinal dysfunction, is associated with pancreatic dysfunction. PATIENTS: Forty seven children with HIV infection without apparent pancreatic disease and 45 sex and age matched healthy controls. METHODS: Pancreatic function was evaluated by measuring elastase 1 concentration and chymotrypsin activity in stools by ELISA and colorimetric methods, respectively. Intestinal function was evaluated by measuring fat and protein loss by the steatocrit method and by faecal alpha1 antitrypsin concentration. RESULTS: 14 (30%) had abnormal pancreatic function tests: seven had isolated elastase activity deficiency, three isolated chymotrypsin deficiency, and four pancreatic deficiencies in both enzymes. Patient enzyme values were significantly lower than those of controls. Low faecal pancreatic enzymes were not associated with symptoms. Twelve children had steatorrhoea and four had increased alpha1 antitrypsin. Steatorrhoea was significantly associated with reduced faecal pancreatic enzymes. There was a significant negative correlation between elastase 1 concentration and steatocrit. Children with pathological faecal elastase 1 or chymotrypsin values did not differ from the other HIV infected children with respect to nutritional and immunological status, stage of HIV disease, presence of opportunistic infections, or drug administration. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal pancreatic function tests are a frequent feature of paediatric HIV infection; this condition is associated with steatorrhoea, which probably contributes to the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In coeliac disease it has been demonstrated that the indirect pancreatic function tests detect a greater percentage of subjects with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency than the secretin-caerulein test. AIMS: To evaluate faecal pancreatic elastase-1 assay in monitoring patients with coeliac disease. PATIENTS: Thirty patients with coeliac disease (11 m; age range 1-7 years) completed a 2-month follow-up. As controls, we studied two sex-, age-matched patient groups: a) 15 patients with cystic fibrosis, b) 40 surgical patients without gastroenterological disease. METHODS: In all coeliac subjects, stools were collected over 24 hours at diagnosis and then 30 and 60 days after commencement of the gluten-free diet; on a sample of the faeces we assayed elastase-1 activity. In the control patients, faeces were collected over 24 hours for elastase-1 assay only once. The coeliac patients only underwent the secretin-caerulein test, at diagnosis. RESULTS: Ten out of 30 coeliac patients (33%) had subnormal faecal elastase-1 values at diagnosis, while all the surgical controls had values within the normal range; median values in coeliac patients were significantly lower than those of the surgical controls (median 287 mcg/g, 95% CI 271-430, versus 487 mcg/g, 95% CI 426-538, p < 0.007). Cystic fibrosis patient values (median 10 mcg/g, 95% CI 7-155) were significantly lower than both those of coeliac patients and those of the surgical controls (p < 0.0001). The secretin-caerulein test showed that 7/30 coeliac patients (23%) had a deficiency in one or more pancreatic enzymes; all these subjects had below normal faecal elastase-1 values. During the follow-up, we observed a progressive reduction in the number of coeliacs with pancreatic impairment; however, after 2 months of gluten-free diet, faecal elastase-1 deficiency persisted in 2/30 coeliacs. CONCLUSIONS: Faecal elastase-1 determination in coeliac patients reveals a similar frequency and duration of pancreatic impairment to those observed in studies performed using the faecal chymotrypsin assay; a reduction in faecal elastase-1 values can be linked to "non-typical pancreatic diseases".},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role that pancreatic impairment plays in growth recovery and the duration of this impairment. METHODS: Forty-six patients with celiac disease who had a median age of 2.5 years were enrolled. Fecal chymotrypsin level was determined at diagnosis and then every 15 days after the beginning of a gluten-free diet in all patients. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 17 of 46 patients with celiac disease had subnormal fecal chymotrypsin values. During the gluten-free diet, a progressive reduction in the percentage of patients with subnormal fecal chymotrypsin values was observed: 12 of 46 patients after 30 days and 2 of 46 patients after 60 days. Weight increase after 2 months of gluten-free diet was significantly greater in patients with normal fecal chymotrypsin values at diagnosis than in patients with subnormal values, and a positive correlation was found between fecal chymotrypsin at diagnosis and weight increase (r = 0.56). CONCLUSIONS: A small percentage of patients with celiac disease still had subnormal chymotrypsin concentrations after 60 days of gluten-free diet. Fecal chymotrypsin is a predictive index of weight recovery in the first months after diagnosis of celiac disease; it could be used to select patients for enzyme supplementation therapy.},

   abstract = {Since PAP is a stress protein expressed in human pancreas during pancreatitis but also constitutively synthesized in the small intestine, we looked whether its expression would be altered in patients with celiac disease. Serum PAP concentrations were determined consecutively in 54 patients with celiac disease on a free diet (group A), in 47 patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet (group B), in 22 patients with other intestinal pathologies but with normal intestinal mucosa (group C), in 14 patients with retarded growth, no gastrointestinal disease and normal intestinal mucosa (group D), and in 17 controls (group E). Serum PAP levels (ng/ml) were significantly higher in group A (127.3 +/- 56.8) than in the other groups (B: 47.2 +/- 20.5; C: 51.5 +/- 32.2; D: 47 +/- 22.8; E: 27.6 +/- 9.0), which were not different from each other. In group A, a positive correlation was observed between serum PAP values and antigluten antibody levels (vs. AGA IgG r = 0.58, p < 0.001; vs. AGA IgA r = 0.66, p < 0.001). Furthermore, 12 patients from group A were evaluated after 10-12 months of gluten-free diet and in all of them PAP serum concentration had decreased (mean +/- SE before the diet 122.5 +/- 36.4, after the diet 48.7 +/- 13.7, p < 0.0001). In addition, we performed an immunocytochemical study to localize PAP in the intestinal mucosa of patients from all groups except E. PAP was localized to the Paneth cells and to some globet cells, in patients with mucosal atrophy as well as in those with normal mucosa with no obvious quantitative difference. We concluded that in patients with celiac disease the active phase of the disease was accompanied by an increased serum concentration of PAP. Further studies are necessary to understand the mechanism leading to PAP elevation in the serum of patients with celiac disease.},

AIM: To make a retrospective study of the association of SIgAD with CD in Italy. METHODS: Hospital medical records of 2098 patients consecutively diagnosed as having CD were reviewed. RESULTS: Of 2098 patients with CD, 54 (2.6%) had SIgAD, representing a 10-16-fold increase over that in the population in general. This increase was not influenced by age or geographical factors. Patients with SIgAD had a higher incidence of silent forms (7/54, 13%), recurrent infections (16/54, 29.6%), and atopic diseases (7/54, 13%) than those without. The association with autoimmune and malignant diseases and the outcome after eating a gluten free diet were similar in patients with or without SIgAD. In all patients with SIgAD, antibodies for IgA gliadin and endomysium were absent, but serum levels of IgG anti-gliadin antibodies were high in almost all of them (51/54). CONCLUSIONS: Serum IgA should be measured in order to be able to interpret negative results for IgA anti-gliadin antibodies and anti-endomysial antibodies in patients being screened for CD. Since some patients with CD and SIgAD may be negative for IgG anti-gliadin antibodies, an intestinal biopsy should be performed in all suspected cases.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is the life-long intolerance to dietary gluten, usually characterized by severe damage to the small-intestinal mucosa. The widespread use of sensitive diagnostic tools, such as the serum anti-gliadin and the anti-endomysial antibodies, has shown not only that coeliac disease is one of the commonest disorders in Western countries but also that this condition is characterized by a higher degree of clinical variability than previously thought (typical, atypical and silent forms). The existence of a latent-potential coeliac disease and even a gluten-sensitive disease with immunological activation of an otherwise normal small-intestinal mucosa has recently been postulated. An increased prevalence of coeliac disease in a number of other disorders has also been reported in both children and adults. The reasons for such a wide clinical heterogeneity are still poorly understood but are likely to depend on both genetic and environmental factors. Further investigations are required to evaluate the impact of undiagnosed, clinically milder forms of coeliac disease on the well-being of the population.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: An increase in the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) in the rectal epithelium of patients with active celiac disease has been described. No data are available about how they vary during a gluten-free diet. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of a gluten-free diet on T-cell activation in the rectal mucosa of adult patients with celiac disease. METHODS: Frozen duodenal and rectal biopsies were available in four celiac patients (one male, three female, mean age 39 yr) both before and after 7 to 24 months on a gluten-free diet. Biopsy samples were stained using monoclonal antibodies directed against CD3, betaF1, TcRdelta1, CD25, and HLADR. Numbers of IEL were estimated by counting the peroxidase-stained cells per 100 epithelial cells. Four patients without histological abnormalities were used as control subjects. RESULTS: In the four patients with active celiac disease but in none of the controls, CD25 was expressed by both duodenal and rectal lamina propria cells and HLADR was expressed by duodenal (4/4) and rectal (2/4) epithelial cells. In addition, two patients with active celiac disease had features of lymphocytic colitis, i.e., >20 IEL per 100 epithelial cells. After a gluten-free diet, the mean number of rectal CD3+ betaF1+ IEL decreased (9% vs 21%) and the expression of CD25 and HLADR was no longer present. These changes mirrored those found in the small intestinal biopsies. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that in celiac disease, gluten-driven T-cell activation is not restricted to the proximal part of the intestine but is present on the whole intestinal length. Assessment of the effectiveness of a gluten-free diet through rectal biopsies warrants investigation, as it could lessen discomfort for patients and prove more cost-effective.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The etiology of refractory sprue is unclear. To gain insight into its pathogenesis, the phenotype and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement status of intestinal lymphocytes were analyzed in a group of patients with clinical or biological features of celiac disease but either initially or subsequently refractory to a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Intestinal biopsy specimens were obtained from 26 adults: 6 patients with refractory sprue, 7 patients with active celiac disease, and 13 normal controls. The phenotype of intestinal lymphocytes was studied by immunohistochemistry and, in 3 patients with refractory sprue, by cytometry of lymphocytes purified from intestinal biopsy specimens. TCR rearrangements were assessed by studying TCRgammaV-J junctional regions from DNA extracted from intestinal biopsy specimens and purified intestinal lymphocytes. RESULTS: In the 6 patients with refractory sprue, but not in normal controls or patients with active celiac disease, the intestinal epithelium was massively infiltrated by small lymphocytes that lacked CD8, CD4, and TCR, contained intracytoplasmic but not surface CD3epsilon chains, and exhibited restricted TCRgamma gene rearrangements. CONCLUSIONS: Refractory sprue is associated with an abnormal subset of intraepithelial lymphocytes containing CD3epsilon and restricted rearrangements of the TCRgamma chain but lacking surface expression of T-cell receptors.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of serologic antigliadin antibody (AGA) testing in predicting celiac disease in children. DESIGN: Prospective clinical assessment. SETTING: Hopital Sainte-Justine, montreal. PATIENTS: A total of 176 children with possible celiac disease who were referred for duodenal biopsy between January 1992 and June 1995. OUTCOME MEASURES: IgA and IgG AGA titres, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); duodenal biopsy; clinical outcome on a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Of the 176 children 30 were found to have celiac disease according to the criteria of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN). The sensitivity and specificity of the IgA AGA titre, as well as its positive and negative predictive values, were 80%, 92%, 67% and 96% respectively; the corresponding values for the IgG AGA titre were 83%, 79%, 45% and 96%. The respective values for IgA and IgG AGA titres combined were 93%, 71%, 43% and 98%. Only 2 of the 30 patients with celiac disease had false-negative results for both IgA and IgG AGA titres. The IgA and IgG AGA titres decreased significantly (p < 0.005) in all 11 patients after being on a gluten-free diet for at least 10 months and reached normal values in 8. CONCLUSION: AGA screening for celiac disease permits better selection of patients for duodenal biopsy and adds specificity to the histologic diagnosis. Such screening cannot replace intestinal biopsy, which remains the gold standard for diagnosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Evaluate in patients with celiac disease the tolerance of prolonged consumption of small amounts of gliadin contained in products containing wheat starch. DESIGN: Open 1-year trial of the addition of wheat starch to a gluten-free diet in a cohort of adult patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease who had never consumed wheat starch. The control group consisted of patients with celiac disease who tolerated wheat starch. SUBJECTS: Seventeen patients with celiac disease and 14 control patients, all diagnosed according to criteria of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, were recruited from the Canadian Celiac Association and the Quebec Celiac Foundation. SETTING: The study was conducted in the outpatient clinic of the Gastroenterology and Nutrition Service of Ste Justine Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were asked to consume four to six portions daily of a wheat starch-containing product, mainly bread, for up to 1 year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The gliadin content of the wheat starch product used in this trial was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patient outcome measures included symptoms, nutritional parameters (anthropometric data, complete blood count, serum folate and iron levels), and immunologic parameters (antigliadin antibody and antiendomysium antibody titers). RESULTS: A quantifiable amount of immunoreactive gliadin (0.75 mg/100 g) was found in the wheat starch. The majority of the patients with celiac disease (11 of 17) who had never consumed wheat starch previously developed symptoms, which resolved within weeks of discontinuing the product. Relapse of skin lesions was seen in two of three patients with coexisting dermatitis herpetiformis. No weight loss or biochemical changes were observed. Despite the presence of symptoms, antigliadin antibody and antiendomysium antibody determinations were not useful to detect the clinical intolerance. APPLICATIONS: The innocuousness of the long-term ingestion of "gluten-free" products containing wheat starch is still unproven, and prolonged use of such products by patients with celiac disease cannot be recommended.},

   abstract = {The mechanisms responsible for bowel disturbances in celiac disease are still relatively unknown. Recent reports suggested that small bowel motor abnormalities may be involved in this pathological condition; however, there are no studies addressing small bowel transit in celiac disease before and after a gluten-free diet. We studied the mouth-to-cecum transit time of a caloric liquid meal in a homogeneous group of celiac patients presenting with clinical and biochemical evidence of malabsorption and complaining of diarrhea. Sixteen patients were recruited and investigated by means of hydrogen breath test through ingestion of 20 g lactulose together with an enteral gluten-free diet formula. A urinary D-xylose test was also done in each patient. Both breath tests and D-xylose tests were carried out basally and after a period of gluten-free diet. Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited as a control group and underwent the same breath testing. At the time of the diagnosis, mouth-to-cecum transit time was significantly prolonged in celiacs with respect to controls (243 +/- 10 vs 117 +/- 6 min, P = 0.0001). The D-xylose test was also abnormal (average urinary concentration 2.8 +/- 0.25 g, normal values >4.5). No correlation was found in patients between mouth-to-cecum transit time and urinary D-xylose output (r = 0.22). After the gluten-free diet period, mouth-to-cecum transit time in celiacs was significantly reduced compared to prediet transit (134 +/- 8 vs 243 +/- 10 min, P = 0.0001) and did not show statistical difference when compared to that found in controls (P = 0.1). The D-xylose test reverted to normal in all but two subjects, who were found to be noncompliant with the diet. Mouth-to-cecum transit time is significantly prolonged in patients affected by untreated celiac disease when compared to healthy controls. This alteration might not be correlated to intestinal malabsorption, and the prolonged orocecal transit could be due to impaired small bowel function (deranged motility?). Since intestinal transit returned to normal values after an adequate gluten-free period, a link with severe active mucosal lesions is suggestive.},

PATIENTS: Fifty-five adults with coeliac disease and 51 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. METHODS: Routine clinical and laboratory work-up was used for diagnosis of coeliac disease. Age of first sexual intercourse, prevalence of individuals who were sexually active, frequency of intercourse, reduction in sexual desire, difficulty in attaining orgasm, pain during intercourse, and prevalence of individuals defining themselves as satisfied with their sexual life were investigated by an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire administered before and after one year's treatment with a gluten-free diet in coeliac patients, and only once in controls. Analyses included clinical conditions, demographic and socio-economic data. RESULTS: Compared with controls, untreated coeliac patients had a significantly lower frequency of intercourse and a lower prevalence of individuals satisfied with their sexual life. Patients with overt and subclinical coeliac disease did not show significant differences for any indices of sexual behaviour. Compared with untreated conditions, coeliac patients after one year of treatment had improved values for all indices of sexual behaviour: differences were significant for frequency of intercourse and prevalence of individuals satisfied with their sexual life. CONCLUSION: Untreated coeliac disease, even in its subclinical presentation, is associated with disorders in sexual behaviour which are improved by the dietary treatment.},

METHODS: Depressive symptoms were evaluated in 92 adult coeliacs, 100 normal controls (NC), and 48 chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) patients by means of a modified version of the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (M-SDS). CD patients were evaluated for the level of knowledge about CD and the compliance with diet. RESULTS: The M-SDS score differentiated CD patients from NC. Age at diagnosis and duration of and compliance with diet did not correlate with depression. Three main factors could be identified with the M-SDS: 'reactiveness', 'pessimism', and 'anhedonic-asthenic'. CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms are a feature of CD; they are present to a similar extent in patients with childhood- and adulthood-diagnosed CD. The results underline the relevance of personal psychologic resources, which play a fundamental role in determining and sustaining depression.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Conflicting evidence is reported about the effect of treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) in adults with celiac disease (CD). This study analyzed the effects on BMD induced by treatment with a calcium-rich, gluten-free diet in adults with nonsilent CD. METHODS: In 30 women and 11 men with newly diagnosed CD, BMD was measured at the right femur (femoral neck and right Ward's triangle) and the lumbar spine by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry under untreated conditions (pretreatment) and after 1-yr treatment with a calcium-rich, gluten-free diet. RESULTS: On average, posttreatment BMD was greater than pretreatment BMD at the lumbar spine (mean +/- SE: 0.907 +/- 0.028 and 0.795 +/- 0.028 g/cm2, respectively; p < 0.001), the femoral neck (0.818 +/- 0.023 and 0.741 +/- 0.030 g/cm2, respectively; p = 0.002), and the Ward's triangle (0.703 +/- 0.025 and 0.654 +/- 0.025 g/cm2, respectively; p < 0.001). The greatest BMD change (percent of baseline) was observed at the lumbar spine (+14.1%), the smallest at the Ward's triangle (+7.5%). In the absence of appropriate controls, the BMD change expected in the patients under untreated conditions was estimated by regressing pretreatment BMD over duration of CD with control for gender and age at which CD became clinically evident. The regression coefficient of this analysis indicated that 1 yr of untreated CD was associated with a BMD decrease at the lumbar spine by 0.00570 g/cm2 (95% confidence interval -0.0103 to -0.0011 g/cm2). The 95% confidence interval of the treatment-induced change in BMD at the lumbar spine (+0.060 to +0.160 g/cm2) did not overlap the 95% confidence interval of the BMD change expected under untreated conditions. A large interindividual variability was observed in the BMD response to the treatment: in univariate and multivariate analyses, the treatment-induced change in BMD was significantly related to gender (greater in women than in men) and to pretreatment age and BMD. CONCLUSIONS: The data show that BMD is increased by dietary treatment of CD in most but not all adult patients; pretreatment BMD, gender, and pretreatment age predict the bone response after a 1-yr treatment.},

   abstract = {Studies to determine the nature of the cereal component toxic to patients with coeliac disease have concentrated on wheat due to its nutritional importance. A number of in vitro studies have indicated the presence of one or more coeliac-disease-activating epitopes with the N terminus of the A gliadin molecule. In vivo challenge with three synthetic peptides subsequently indicated the toxicity of a peptide corresponding to amino acid 31-49 of A gliadin. Changes induced by this peptide included a decrease in the ratio of villous height to crypt depth, a decrease in enterocyte surface cell height and an increase in intra-epithelial lymphocyte count. There was evidence of mRNA for the pro-inflammatory cytokincs interferon gamma and interleukin 2 within 2 h of the in vivo challenge. We examined electron-microscopically biopsies from patients with coeliac disease challenged with gluten to determine the subcellular sites where gliadin co-localised with T-cell receptor subunits and HLA antigens. There were differences in co-localisation patterns between treated and untreated coeliac patients. These differences and the different patterns of gliadin staining within enterocytes of coeliac patients and controls, observed by others, suggest that gliadin may be metabolised via a different immunogenic pathway in coeliac disease. This might result in an abnormal presentation to the immune system, triggering a pathogenic, rather than a tolerogenic response.},

   abstract = {Many studies have been carried out on different aspects of coeliac disease in children and adolescents. However, little has been done on how these patients experience their situation and how they cope with dietary treatment. A group of 39 children and adolescents with coeliac disease participated in a controlled questionnaire study. Conclusions are that the acceptance of a gluten-free diet is problematic for the majority of children and adolescents affected by coeliac disease; in particular in the 12 to 17 year old group, that is in that period of life in which the individual tends to oppose the adult world, in search of an individual personality. This search is disturbed in the majority of coeliac patients. The feelings of difficulty connected to the gluten-free diet appear to be almost absent in the family environment, whereas they emerge significantly at times of meeting and sharing with friends.},

We report two adult patients who fulfilled all the criteria for the diagnosis of this disorder. METHODS: Over the past 5 years we have seen four adult patients (all women, median age 51.5 [range 38-64] years) with subtotal villous atrophy, which was unresponsive to a gluten-free diet. The patients were HLA-DQ2 positive. IgA antigliadin and antiendomysial antibodies were not found in any of the patients. We did an indirect immunofluorescence search for enterocyte autoantibodies on monkey jejunum and for other autoantibodies for all four patients. FINDINGS: Of the four patients, two were positive for enterocyte autoantibodies and one of these two patients was positive for antiactin, antiparietal cell, and antithyroid microsomal autoantibodies. INTERPRETATION: To the best of our knowledge the two patients affected by severe enteropathy, who had never responded to any exclusion diet, and who were positive for enterocyte autoantibodies are the first cases of autoimmune enteropathy described in adults. We propose that adult patients whose disorders are unresponsive to a gluten-free diet should be tested for enterocyte autoantibodies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Adult celiac disease is associated with osteopenia, which is not always reversible after gluten-free diet (GFD). A prospective study was conducted to evaluate whether pretreatment indices of bone and mineral metabolism are predictive of the extent of bone mass gain after diet. METHODS: Lumbar and femoral bone mineral density (z-score) and serum levels of parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, COOH-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP), and COOH-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) were measured in 20 celiac patients at diagnosis and after 2 years of GFD. RESULTS: All patients showed a posttreatment improvement in bone mass and in serum levels of indices of bone and mineral metabolism. Nevertheless, only in 12 of 20 patients was this improvement at least equal to half the SD of the z-score, which equals a gain of at least 5% in bone mass. Pretreatment levels of PICP strictly correlated with the increase in lumbar (r(s) = 0.92; P < 0.001) and femoral z-scores (r(s) = 0.89; P < 0.001). Only in patients with basal PICP above the normal range did the z-score increase after GFD by at least half the SD. CONCLUSIONS: In adult celiac disease, a high rate of osteosynthetic activity before treatment is predictive of the satisfactory recovery of bone mass after GFD.},

We report the prevalence of celiac disease in a stratified random sample (n = 101) of adult insulin-dependent diabetic patients (age, 18-59 yr) attending our clinic, and in an age- and sex-matched control group (n = 51). METHODS: Screening was by anti-endomysial antibody, measured by indirect immunofluorescence using sections of human umbilical cord. RESULTS: Celiac disease had not been suspected in any patient at the time of screening. Eight patients tested positive for anti-endomysial antibody, all of whom had a distal duodenal biopsy performed. Five patients had histologic evidence of celiac disease. One patient with negative histology was receiving immunosuppressive therapy for a renal-pancreas transplant. Of the five patients with abnormal histology, two improved on gluten restriction, one was unable to comply, one refused treatment, and one was lost to follow-up. No control subject tested positive for endomysial antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes have an increased prevalence of celiac disease. Because most cases are clinically unrecognized, consideration should be given to screening all insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients with endomysial antibodies.},

Among these, thyroid disease has been described in around 10% of the cases with hypothyroidism being the most frequently reported. Clinical suspicion of thyroid involvement in patients with celiac disease is difficult since the symptomatology is scarce or is masked by the picture of malabsorption. Nonetheless, its detection is important since it is not solved by gluten free diet and its correction requires specific treatment. Thyroid function studies, in addition to determination of antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibodies, should be considered in celiac patients refractory to conventional dietetic treatment. We herein present the case of a 65-year-old woman who consulted for a malabsorption syndrome in whom celiac disease of the adult was simultaneously presented with hyperthyroidism secondary to autoimmune thyroiditis.},

However, reactive lymphoid follicles have been found also in the stomach of H. pylori-negative coeliac patients, suggesting that other environmental factors may be involved in MALT genesis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of gluten withdrawal in H. pylori-negative coeliac patients with gastric MALT. METHODS: We studied 23 H. pylori-negative untreated coeliac patients with gastric MALT. All patients underwent determination of antigliadin (AGA) and antiendomysium antibodies (EMA) and upper endoscopy with multiple biopsies in duodenum, gastric corpus, and antrum. Lymphoid follicles and H. pylori status were assessed by histopathologic and enzymatic analysis. All patients were started on a gluten-free diet and were reevaluated after 12 months. To consider their adherence to the gluten-free diet we relied on direct patient questioning. Thirteen patients who had strictly adhered to the gluten-free diet constituted our study group. Ten patients who had not strictly adhered to gluten withdrawal from their diet constituted the control group. RESULTS: Regression of MALT was obtained in 9 of 13 (69%) patients who strictly followed the gluten-free diet; in the control group MALT disappeared in 2 of 10 (20%) patients (P=0.0361). DISCUSSION: Disappearance of reactive lymphoid follicles in the gastric mucosa of H. pylori-negative coeliac patients after gluten withdrawal suggests that antigens related to alimentary gluten may constitute persistent stimuli for development of gastric MALT in coeliac patients.},

The PBI was also administered to a control group (55 subjects) and 22 patients with Crohn's disease or celiac disease. The three groups were matched for age and socioeconomic status. The RAN and B/PAN patients gave significantly different interpretations of the parental bond (PB): for the former, it was adequate with both parents, for the latter it was inadequate, especially with the father. The fact that these differences exist at the onset of anorexia prior to any possible effect of therapy suggests that its structure is determined by different family dynamics.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease may present with dyspepsia or reflux. There are characteristic duodenal appearances associated with villous atrophy (mosaic pattern mucosa and loss, reduction in number or scalloping of duodenal folds) which may prompt small-bowel biopsy during routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. These appearances were sought in patients referred by their general practitioners for open-access endoscopy (OAE), to determine the prevalence and significance of coeliac disease as a cause of symptoms. METHODS: Five hundred consecutive patients undergoing OAE by one consultant gastroenterologist were studied. Forceps biopsy specimens from the distal duodenum were taken if appearances were suggestive. If villous atrophy was confirmed, the response of symptoms to dietary gluten exclusion was assessed. RESULTS: Ten patients had suggestive endoscopic appearances, of whom eight had villous atrophy, giving a prevalence of coeliac disease of 1.6% (1:63). All eight had mosaic pattern mucosa, with three also having reduction of duodenal folds, and four having scalloped folds. All had serum endomysial antibodies (EmA). Apart from diarrhoea, described by one patient, there were no symptoms of 'typical' coeliac disease at diagnosis: three patients were overweight. After dietary gluten exclusion all reported symptomatic improvement, with disappearance of EmA in five patients to date. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of coeliac disease among patients undergoing OAE, which is relevant to their clinical symptoms and which can be identified by careful endoscopic inspection of the duodenum.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is characterized by small intestinal damage with loss of absorptive villi and hyperplasia of the crypts, typically leading to malabsorption. In addition to nutrient deficiencies, prolonged celiac disease is associated with an increased risk for malignancy, especially intestinal T-cell lymphoma. Celiac disease is precipitated by ingestion of the protein gliadin, a component of wheat gluten, and usually resolves on its withdrawal. Gliadin initiates mucosal damage which involves an immunological process in individuals with a genetic predisposition. However, the mechanism responsible for the small intestinal damage characteristic of celiac disease is still under debate. Small intestinal biopsy with the demonstration of a flat mucosa which is reversed on a gluten-free diet is considered the main approach for diagnosis of classical celiac disease. In addition, IgA antibodies against gliadin and endomysium, a structure of the smooth muscle connective tissue, are valuable tools for the detection of patients with celiac disease and for therapy control. Incidence rates of childhood celiac disease range from 1:300 in Western Ireland to 1:4700 in other European countries, and subclinical cases detected by serological screening revealed prevalences of 3.3 and 4 per 1000 in Italy and the USA, respectively. IgA antibodies to endomysium are particularly specific indicators of celiac disease, suggesting that this structure contains one or more target autoantigens that play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. However, the identification of the endomysial autoantigen(s) has remained elusive. We identified tissue transglutaminase as the unknown endomysial autoantigen. Interestingly, gliadin is a preferred substrate for this enzyme, giving rise to novel antigenic epitopes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Immunoglobulin A (IgA) autoantibodies to endomysium (EMA) are highly specific and sensitive markers for celiac disease. Recently, we identified tissue transglutaminase (tTG) as the major if not sole endomysial autoantigen. METHODS: An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established to measure IgA anti-tTG titers in serum samples from 106 celiac patients with partial or subtotal villous atrophy, 43 celiac patients on a gluten-free diet, and 114 diseased and healthy controls. Results were correlated with clinical and histological data and with EMA titers. RESULTS: In patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease consuming a normal, gluten-containing diet, 98.1% of the serum samples had elevated IgA titers against tTG, whereas 94.7% of the control sera were negative. IgA anti-tTG correlated positively with semiquantitative IgA EMA titers (r = 0.862; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: An ELISA based on tTG allows diagnosis of celiac disease with a high sensitivity and specificity. IgA anti-tTG and IgA EMA show an excellent correlation, further confirming the enzyme as the celiac disease autoantigen. Because the assay is quantitative, not subjected to interobserver variation, and easy to perform, it will be a useful tool for population screening of a hitherto underdiagnosed disease.},

We describe the case of a 28-year-old woman, who developed severe coeliac disease during a trip in the Australian outback. The nutritional history revealed that the patient's diet contained more wheat products during her trip than she was used to in Holland. Moreover, the onset of symptoms coincided with a spontaneous miscarriage of an 8-week-old embryo. This correlation has been described in several case reports in the literature. However, the pathophysiologic mechanism behind this correlation is unknown. Some speculative mechanisms are proposed here. Further investigations into this relationship could increase our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of coeliac disease.},

The hemodynamic parameters of the superior mesenteric artery were evaluated by duplex Doppler ultrasonography in children with celiac disease to show whether histomorphologic changes in small bowel mucosa led to any alteration in splanchinic blood flow. METHODS: The hemodynamic parameters of the superior mesenteric artery were evaluated by Doppler ultrasonography in 23 children with celiac disease. Ten patients were studied at the time of diagnosis. The remaining 13 children were studied after complete clinical and histologic recovery induced by gluten-free diet. Additionally, 9 patients out of 13 who were on a gluten-free diet for about 2 years were given gluten challenge, and superior mesenteric artery blood flow was measured after the challenge. The results were compared with those of healthy children. RESULTS: Peak systolic velocity of the superior mesenteric artery was higher in untreated celiac patients than in healthy controls and treated celiac patients. Peak systolic velocity of the superior mesenteric artery in the treated group of children was close to that of control subjects, implying that successful treatment with gluten-free diet improves hemodynamic changes. The comparison of Doppler ultrasonographic measurements of the challenge group before and after the gluten challenge revealed that the peak systolic velocity, resistive index, and blood flow of the superior mesenteric artery were changed significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The pathophysiologic events in small bowel mucosa during the active phase of celiac disease induce some hemodynamic changes that can be detected noninvasively by duplex Doppler ultrasonography.},

GH-BP II levels were significantly lower in patients during the active phase of the disease than after the diet or in comparison with control subjects, appropriate for age and sex. There was no difference in the GH-BP-I levels of patients and controls, nor did they change after the diet. Blood levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were reduced before the diet in all patients while ligand blotting showed that IGFBP-2 and 1 were increased. All of these parameters normalized after the gluten-free diet. IGFBP-4 was not greatly influenced by the disease. Furthermore, we found a significant, positive correlation between GH-BP II and IGF-I or IGFBP-3 levels. The height standard deviation scores and body mass indices of the patients improved significantly after the diet. The body mass index significantly and positively correlated with GH-BP II, IGF-I or IGFBP-3 levels. In conclusion, our data show that celiac children had multiple alterations in the growth axis during the active phase of the disease which disappeared during the gluten-free diet.},

Prognosis of epilepsy would depend on how early the gluten-free diet was started. The diagnosis of celiac sprue should be entertained in patients with brain calcifications and epilepsy. Search for anti-endomysium antibodies could provide useful information although villosity atrophy in the proximal portion of the small bowel and its regression with gluten-free diet remain the essential elements for the diagnosis of celiac sprue.},

   abstract = {Colonic histopathology in some patients with untreated celiac sprue and refractory sprue has been said to be indistinguishable from lymphocytic colitis, but there have been no objective comparisons on which this is based. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and to characterize the nature of colonic histopathology at the time of diagnosis in patients with celiac or refractory sprue. Colonoscopic biopsy specimens obtained at the time of diagnosis from 16 patients with celiac sprue, six patients with refractory sprue, nine patients with lymphocytic colitis, and five normal controls were analyzed blindly by histological and morphometric methods, quantitating the number and specific subtypes of inflammatory cells within the lamina propria and epithelium. Immunoperoxidase staining of intraepithelial lymphocytes with a monoclonal antibody to CD8 also was performed. Three of 16 patients with untreated celiac sprue (19%) were thought to have colonic histological abnormalities, which by morphometry consisted of slightly increased numbers of lymphocytes in the surface epithelium and lamina propria, many of which were CD8-positive. These abnormalities were distinguishable from lymphocytic colitis by the lack of increased overall lamina propria cellularity and surface epithelial abnormalities, and by fewer intraepithelial lymphocytes. In refractory sprue, colonic histological abnormalities were more frequent than in celiac sprue, occurring in four of six patients (67%), more pronounced, and identical to those in the lymphocytic colitis syndrome. However, colonic intraepithelial lymphocytes in lymphocytic colitis were mostly CD8-positive, whereas those in the colitis of refractory sprue rarely were. Mild colonic lymphocytosis in patients with untreated celiac sprue should be distinguished from lymphocytic colitis by the lack of surface epithelial abnormalities, the lack of increased cellularity of the lamina propria, and the lack of ongoing watery diarrhea after treatment with a gluten-free diet. In contrast, colonic histopathology in refractory sprue is indistinguishable from lymphocytic colitis, although immunohistochemical differences do exist.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The majority of patients with celiac sprue experience diarrhea before diagnosis. There have been no studies of the prevalence or causes of chronic diarrhea in these patients after treatment with a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with celiac sprue (59 women and 19 men) treated with a gluten-free diet for at least 12 months were surveyed about their bowel habits. Those with chronic diarrhea, defined as passage of loose stools three or more times per week for 6 months, underwent an extensive diagnostic evaluation to determine its cause. RESULTS: Sixty-two of the 78 patients (79%) experienced diarrhea before treatment, and 13 (17%) had chronic diarrhea (of lesser severity) after treatment. The causes of diarrhea in 11 patients consenting to this study were microscopic colitis, steatorrhea secondary to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, dietary lactose or fructose malabsorption, anal sphincter dysfunction causing fecal incontinence, and the irritable bowel syndrome. Only 1 patient had antigliadin antibodies detected in serum or small intestinal villous atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: After treatment of celiac sprue with a gluten-free diet, chronic diarrhea persists in a substantial percentage of patients. Although ongoing gluten ingestion is one possible cause, other causes may be more frequent. Therefore, diagnostic investigation of diarrhea in celiac sprue after treatment seems warranted.},

A prevalence of 1 per 676 individuals has been reported among adults in Norway. A much higher incidence has been documented in Sweden, both among children (one per approximately 300 liveborns) and among adults (1:256 healthy blood donors). Similar prevalence figures have been reported from Italy among young students. Eight new, biopsy-proven cases of coeliac disease were recently found by screening 2296 blood donors in Bergen (1:287). The symptoms of coeliac disease are often vague. Oligo- and asymptomatic cases often occur. The advisory council of the Norwegian Coeliac Association has established guidelines for the diagnostic work-up and for follow-up of patients with coeliac disease, in order to raise awareness of the disease, achieve a standardized work-up procedure and improve follow-up.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Decreased bone mineral density is a common finding in untreated celiac disease patients. However, the precise pathophysiology of osteopenia remains incompletely understood. Pathological features of gluten sensitivity are associated with local release of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines. We investigated the serum levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-1 receptor antagonist in celiac patients and correlated them with bone density measurements. METHODS: We assessed serum samples of 16 female patients at the time of diagnosis (on an unrestricted diet) and after a mean time of 37 months on a gluten-free diet. At the same time, bone mineral density in the lumbar spine and total skeleton was determined by DEXA. RESULTS: Untreated patients had high serum levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 and normal IL-1-RA. Treatment produced a decrease in median IL-1beta levels (p = NS) and a significant diminution of IL-6 (p < 0.05). On the contrary, IL-1-RA increased significantly after treatment (p < 0.05). Baseline lumbar spine Z-score and IL-6 levels exhibited a significant inverse correlation (r = -0.61; p < 0.01). Patients with more severe baseline osteopenia (< -2 Z-scores) had a significantly lower IL-1-RA than those with less bone compromise (> -2 Z-scores). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the inflammatory process observed in active celiac disease is associated with high serum levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 and normal levels of IL-1-RA. Treatment significantly reduces both proinflammatory cytokines and significantly increases the antiinflammatory one. We also suggest that these cytokines might have a role in the osteopenia associated with celiac disease.},

The presence of normocalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism should prompt the physician to look for vitamin D deficiency. This observation concerns a 34-year-old vegetarian woman with combined primary hyperparathyroidism, Graves' disease, and celiac disease. The patient presented with severe bone deformities; she was unable to walk, and had severe muscular weakness and weight loss. Biochemical findings revealed severe hyperparathyroidism with normocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, very low urinary calcium, and low 25-hydroxy vitamin D level. Thyroid tests showed hyperthyroidism with positive thyroid receptor antibodies, confirming the presence of Graves' disease. Positive antigliadin and antireticulin antibodies and complete villous atrophy on duodenal biopsy established the presence of celiac disease. The patient underwent a near-total thyroidectomy, with the removal of a parathyroid adenoma. To our knowledge, this observation is the first finding of an association between celiac disease, Graves' disease, and primary hyperparathyroidism. It emphasizes the need to rule out intestinal malabsorption in the case of normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism.},

Comparisons were made with two groups of 12 healthy control dogs of breeds other than IS, one fed the same diet as the setters and the other fed a gluten-free diet. Gluten-sensitive IS showed a rise in permeability (mean [SEM] urinary L/R) from 0.23 (0.07) at four weeks to 0.39 (0.05) at eight weeks, remaining at 0.36 (0.04) at 16 weeks. These results were significantly higher in gluten-sensitive than control IS at six, eight and 16 weeks, compatible with jejunal biopsy lesions characteristic of gluten-sensitive enteropathy demonstrated in affected dogs at 16 weeks. Urinary L/R ratios of control dogs of breeds other than IS peaked at six weeks 0.27 (0.02), and were significantly higher than those of control IS at six and eight weeks, demonstrating differences in permeability between Irish setter dogs and other breeds at this age. There were no significant differences in urinary X/G ratios at six, eight and 16 weeks of age between any of the groups of dogs challenged with gluten. Urinary L/R and X/G ratios were similar in the control dogs of breeds other than IS fed gluten-containing and gluten-free diets. These findings indicate that intestinal permeability testing of puppies during controlled oral gluten challenge provides a practical screening test for gluten sensitivity in Irish setter dogs at an early age.},

Malignant small intestinal lymphoma is the most serious complication of celiac disease, also being noted as a complication of immunosuppressive therapy. The diagnosis of small intestinal lymphoma complicating celiac disease is notoriously difficult. Perforation is the most common complication of small intestinal lymphoma, frank hemorrhage being unusual. We report a case of massive, fatal hemorrhage from small intestinal lymphoma complicating unresponsive celiac disease treated with cyclosporine. The patient was presented with severe diarrhea and nutritional deterioration. Unresponsive celiac disease was diagnosed on the basis of clinical and histologic criteria with no response while on a gluten-free diet, corticotherapy and octreotide acetate injections. Cyclosporine therapy was advised. The patient had a remarkable clinical response. After 3 months from the start of the cyclosporine therapy, the patient returned with massive intestinal bleeding. The patient underwent emergency surgery diagnosing an enteropathy-associated lymphoma. We conclude that cyclosporine therapy for unresponsive celiac disease should be considered in select, severely ill patients only after a full-thickness biopsy of the small intestinal wall to disclose a latent super-imposed lymphoma, which course may be accelerated by immunosuppressive therapy.},

Health professionals should ensure the baby receives a sufficient and balanced diet during the weaning period, to meet the needs for energy and growth. Breast milk or infant formula should continue up to the age of at least one year. The weaning period is a good time to educate parents in good nutrition. A wide variety of foods should be the aim in child nutrition, but each different type needs to be started separately during weaning. Care is needed to ensure vegetarian babies receive enough proteins, vitamins and minerals (especially iron). Failure to thrive has a multitude of causes, and treatment must be that of the cause. Strictly vegan children who eat no dairy products will need added synthetic vitamin B12. Failure to thrive may be due to physical problems (eg choanal atresia), infection, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, parental ignorance or poverty. Other causes include coeliac disease, cow's milk protein allergy, cystic fibrosis, severe eczema or asthma, or diabetes.},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with celiac disease (20 women, five men; mean age, 30 +/- 7 years) and 10 healthy volunteers (seven women, three men; mean age, 28 +/- 6 years) were examined with Doppler sonography. Nineteen patients were untreated (no dietary restrictions) and six patients were treated with a gluten-free diet at the time of the examination. Imaging was performed at both fasting and 15 min after an 1890-kJ meal. We introduced a parameter called "resistive difference," defined as the mathematic difference between the resistive index measured at fasting (highest value) and that measured at 15 min after the meal (lowest value) as a way to express the postprandial resistive change in the superior mesenteric artery. RESULTS: Untreated patients with flat mucosa showed a resistive difference of 0.03 +/- 0.05, followed by untreated patients with mucosal subatrophy (0.05 +/- 0.04), treated patients (0.09 +/- 0.02), and healthy volunteers (0.12 +/- 0.04). A statistically significant difference was noticed between the resistive difference of healthy volunteers and both those of the untreated patients with subatrophy (p = .016) and of the patients with complete atrophy (p = .011), as well as between the resistive difference of the treated patients and both those of the untreated patients with subatrophy (p = .021) and of the patients with complete atrophy (p = .020). CONCLUSION: We believe that Doppler measurement of resistive difference in the superior mesenteric artery can be an effective way to express severity of celiac disease and to document its regression after diet therapy.},

METHODS: Daily dietary fat intake, 24 h fecal fat, COFA, fecal chymotrypsin activity (as an index of pancreatic exocrine function), and total T3, T4, and TSH levels were assessed in 28 patients with active Graves' disease. In 24 patients, reassessment was done after attaining a euthyroid state with carbimazole therapy. RESULTS: In the thyrotoxic state, 13 of 28 patients had steatorrhea, whereas 15 had normal (<6 g/day) fat excretion (11.4 +/- 6.7 g vs 2.9 +/- 0.8 g, p = 0.0007). Daily fat intake, basal BMI, and serum T3 and T4 levels were similar in the steatorrheic and nonsteatorrheic groups. The mean COFA of the steatorrheic group was significantly lower than that of nonsteatorrheic group (91.6% +/- 4.8% vs 97.7% +/- 0.9%, respectively; p = 0.0006). In the steatorrheic group, fat excretion and COFA normalized after attainment of euthyroidism (changes in fat excretion and COFA = 7.3% +/- 6.3 g/day and 7.7% +/- 5.4%, respectively). Fecal chymotrypsin levels were similar in the steatorrheic and nonsteatorrheic thyrotoxics and in 16 healthy control subjects. The levels did not show any significant changes following attainment of euthyroid status. CONCLUSION: Steatorrhea associated with a decrease in COFA can occur in a reversible manner in 46% of patients with Graves' disease. However, steatorrhea in these patients is not linked with weight loss or with pancreatic exocrine dysfunction.},

The aim of this study was evaluate the compliance to a gluten-free diet and the dietary habits in general of coeliac teenagers and young adults. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 306 adolescents and young adults were followed in a coeliac clinic. They were grouped on the basis of: strict compliance to a gluten-free dietary regimen (n = 223, 73%); dietary transgressions 2-3 times/month (n = 46, 15%); and frequent transgressions or a full gluten-containing diet (n = 37, 12%). RESULTS: The physical growth status was optimal in the male patients, and less so in the females, but was not related to compliance. Symptoms were very rare in all groups. Compliance to the diet was related to sex (females better than males), age (younger better than older), good school grades, and good self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS: The teen-agers studied consumed an average of about 11.32 kg/month of gluten-free products provided by the Italian Health System. Gluten-free pasta and bread were the daily choices. The mean cost for each patient was estimated to be Italian Lire 242,640 (ECU 124) per month or ECU 1,490/year.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease has a wide range of clinical features. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether specific HLA genotypes are associated with particular clinical appearances. METHODS: One hundred forty-five patients with confirmed celiac disease were oligotyped for DR and DQ HLA genes. Clinical notes, physical examination, and a questionnaire provided their personal data. Patients were grouped into nine genotypic categories, according to the presence of the specific DQ heterodimer DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 (hence termed alpha0beta0), in single or double dose, and the presence of the DRB4 antigen. RESULTS: Age at first symptoms and age at beginning of gluten-free diet were not significantly different in the nine groups. The initial symptoms of the disease had a similar distribution in all groups. In twenty-seven patients, disease was diagnosed by family screening: they shared a similar HLA genotype with those who had relevant symptoms. The actual growth status-evaluated by standardized height, percentage of median weight for age, and percentage of median weight for height--was not different in the nine groups. Presence of unusual health complaints was not associated with a specific genotype. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that clinical features of celiac disease are associated with different HLA genotypes. Genes outside the HLA may play a relevant role.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: For patients with coeliac disease, adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is essential to restore the intestinal mucosa. It is less clear whether this ensures well-being of the patient. We have therefore assessed aspects of the quality of life of adult coeliac patients who had been on a GFD for 10 years. METHODS: By means of the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), the subjective health status was measured in 89 adult coeliac patients (61% women) aged 35-74 years. Patients shown to be in histologic remission (n=60) were evaluated by means of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). RESULTS: The coeliac patients scored significantly lower in the SF-36 than general population, notably within the General Health and Vitality domains. The low scoring was confined to the female patients, who also reported significantly more gastrointestinal symptoms in the GSRS than the male coeliacs. The functional status and perceived health of the coeliac patients appeared unrelated to their biopsy findings. CONCLUSIONS: After 10 years on a GFD adult coeliac patients fail to attain the same degree of subjective health as the general population. This is particularly true for female patients and suggests that factors beyond normalization of the intestinal mucosa are of importance for the perceived health status of coeliacs diagnosed in adult life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: People with gluten sensitivity should avoid foods containing wheat, rye, and barley, but there has been debate about whether they should avoid oats. Although patients with celiac disease have recently been shown to tolerate oats, less is known about the effects of oats on patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. METHODS: We studied seven men and three women (mean age, 58 years) with biopsy-confirmed dermatitis herpetiformis. They had followed a strict gluten-free diet for a mean of 15.8 years, which controlled their rash and enteropathy. The patients added oats that were not contaminated with gluten to their diets for 12 weeks (mean [+/-SD] daily intake, 62.5+/-10.8 g). RESULTS: None of the patients had any adverse effects. Serologic tests for antigliadin, antireticulin, and antiendomysial antibodies were negative before oats were introduced into the diet and after they were discontinued. Villous architecture remained normal: the mean (+/-SE) ratio of the height of villi to the depth of crypts was 3.59+/-0.11 before the diet and 3.71+/-0.09 afterward (normal, 3 to 5), and the mean enterocyte heights were 31.36+/-0.58 microm and 31.75+/-44 microm, respectively (normal range, 29 to 34). Duodenal intraepithelial lymphocyte counts all remained within normal limits (mean, 13.8+/-1.03 per 100 enterocytes before the diet and 14.2+/-1.2 per 100 enterocytes afterward; normal range, 10 to 30). Dermal IgA showed no significant changes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis can include moderate amounts of oats in their gluten-free diets without deleterious effects to the skin or intestine.},

In most cases of folic acid deficiency no attempt was made to establish aetiology. We recommend that younger patients without an obvious cause are investigated initially by dietary assessment and measurement of anti-endomysial antibody and by duodenal biopsy with small-bowel follow-through if clinically indicated.},

Our study was performed in an area of high prevalence of CS to determine the prevalence of immunodeficiency states in patients with CS, to examine their clinical characteristics, response to treatment, and HLA phenotypes compared with a group of age- and sex-matched persons with CS but without immunoglobulin deficiency. Fourteen of 604 patients with CS were identified as being selectively deficient in IgA, whereas one had common variable immunodeficiency. At diagnosis, anemia was present in 8 of 14 IgA-deficient patients compared with 10 of 42 controls (p = 0.047), whereas abdominal pain was more common in controls with CS. Autoimmunity and recurrent infection were more prevalent in the IgA-deficient group. Response to gluten-free diet was similar in both groups in terms of histologic structure and recovery of intestinal brush-border enzyme activity. IgA-deficient participants with CS had no increased risk of associated malignancy or lymphoma. HLA phenotypes were similar in both groups. The prevalences of selective IgA deficiency and common variable immunodeficiency in this series of patients with CS are 2.31 in 100 and 0.16 in 100, respectively. Although this group is unique in character, close follow-up coupled with conscientious compliance with a gluten-free diet, remains the mainstay of treatment for these patients.},

Three cases had symptoms suggesting malabsorptive syndrome during infancy and one case was diagnosed CD before the onset of seizures. In all cases serologic markers of CD were found, especially antiendomisium antibody, and intestinal biopsy indicated several grades of atrophy. The electroencephalograph (EEG) findings pointed to focal abnormalities in three patients and generalized abnormalities in one patient. In all cases computer tomography (CT) showed bilateral, almost symmetrical occipital calcifications in the cortical subcortical layers. The enhanced CT were unremarkable and magnetic resonance images (MRI) were normal. After diagnosis of CD, all patients followed a gluten-free diet and in three patients a significant reduction in seizure frequency was observed. CD should be ruled out in all cases of epilepsy, cerebral calcifications of unexplained origin and malabsorption syndrome in infancy.},

   abstract = {The increased incidence of lymphoma in celiac sprue (CS) is well documented, and the risk of developing this malignancy is 40-100-fold greater than in the general population. The author believes that gluten may also be at the root of lymphomas in asymptomatic and latent celiac sprue, as well. Among the 20-30% of the population which has the HLA factors most common in celiac, increased intestinal permeability leads to absorption of macromolecular peptides with opioid activity, which derive from pepsin digests of wheat. The presence, in the bloodstream, of these peptides may increase the risk of lymphomas for the entire hereditary group, which includes CS. Several processes contribute to the effect that is herein hypothesized, including opioid attachment at the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), and subsequent downregulation of production of natural killer cells. This may offer an explanation for our longstanding awareness that there is an 'impaired lymphocyte reactivity against tumor cells in patients with coeliac disease' which may also apply to first-degree relatives with the same HLA markers.},

Furthermore, severe inflammation of the small bowel can be present without gastrointestinal symptoms. It is estimated that most subjects with celiac disease are not diagnosed. Yet, early diagnose is desirable, since celiac disease causes growth retardation in untreated children and is potentially cancer disposing. Thus, all patients should adhere to a strict gluten-free diet. The role of antibody testing and small bowel biopsy in celiac disease will be discussed. In the future, the development of new tests may allow screening of large populations.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A high prevalence of reflux esophagitis in celiac children and gut motor disorders in adult patients have been described. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of esophageal symptoms and the esophageal motility pattern in adult celiac patients before and after gluten-free diet. METHODS: In 22 consecutive adult celiac patients, before and after gluten-free diet, and in controls we calculated an esophageal symptom score regarding heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, and chest pain, and performed esophageal manometry using a constantly perfused multilumen catheter. RESULTS: Patients were divided into two groups: with and without steatorrhea. Before gluten-free diet, the prevalence of esophageal symptoms was 45.5 % in all patients, but was significantly higher in patients with steatorrhea than in those without and in 44 control subjects (80% vs 16.7% and 27%, p < 0.05). Lower esophageal sphincter pressure was 17.5+/-5.3 in all patients, but was significantly lower in patients with steatorrhea than in patients without steatorrhea and 11 controls subjects (13.1+/-4.1 vs 21.0+/-2.9 and 20.7+/-3.7 mm Hg (mean+/-SD, p < 0.05). After the diet, the prevalence of esophageal symptoms diminished in all patients (9% vs 45.4%, p < 0.05) and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, measured in 13 patients, increased (19.0+/-3.7 vs 15.7+/-5.3 mm Hg, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Adult celiac patients with steatorrhea present a higher prevalence of esophageal symptoms and a lowered lower esophageal sphincter pressure compared with celiac patients without steatorrhea and control subjects, but these phenomena can be reverted to control levels by gluten-free diet.},

Investigations revealed evidence of malabsorption and jejunal biopsy revealed sub-total villous atrophy in keeping with coeliac disease. Peripheral blood film was within normal limits. She responded well clinically to a gluten-free diet and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Four years after the initial diagnosis she presented acutely with vomiting, pleuritic chest pain, pyrexia and bronchospasm. Blood cultures confirmed the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and she was treated appropriately with ampicillin. Despite this she died shortly after admission. It is recognized that blood film examination alone cannot exclude hyposplenism complicating coeliac disease and it is presumed that this was the reason for the development of fatal pneumococcal septicaemia in this patient. Prophylactic vaccination may be appropriate in hyposplenism secondary to coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is associated with a wide spectrum of clinical presentation and may be overlooked as a diagnosis. There is some evidence that untreated CD is associated with a doubling of mortality, largely due to an increase in the incidence of malignancy and small intestinal lymphoma, which is decreased by a strict gluten-free diet. We studied the clinical features of screening-detected coeliacs compared to age- and sex-matched controls as a 3-year follow-up to a population screening survey, and followed-up subjects who had had CD-associated serology 11 years previously to determine whether they have CD or an increased mortality rate compared to the general population. Samples of the general population (MONICA 1991 and 1983) were screened for CD-associated serology and followed-up after 3 and 11 years, respectively, and assessed by a clinical questionnaire, screening blood tests and jejunal biopsy. Mortality rates for 'all deaths' and 'cancer deaths' were compared in subjects with positive serology in 1983 with reference to the general population. Thirteen coeliacs were diagnosed by villous atrophy following screening, compared to two patients with clinically detected CD, giving a prevalence of 1:122. Clinical features or laboratory parameters were not indicative of CD compared to controls. Subjects with positive serology followed up after 11 years did not have an excess mortality for either cancer deaths or all causes of death. Screening-detected CD is rarely silent and may be associated with significant symptoms and morbidity. In this limited study with small numbers, there does not appear to be an increased mortality from screening-detected CD, although the follow-up may be too short to detect any difference.},

Sixteen of 22 patients positive for gliadin antibodies underwent small bowel biopsy, and 15 had normal mucosa. Patients with chronic oral mucosal disorders and a positive endomysial antibody test may suffer from celiac sprue. By contrast, gliadin antibodies were very prevalent even in the absence of celiac sprue.},

We examined the nutritional status of 40 adult patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease classified according to the grade of villous atrophy: partial, subtotal, and total. Nutritional status was determined by food records as well as by anthropometric and biochemical measurements. Anthropometric results did not differ among the three atrophy groups, but serum ferritin and erythrocyte folate were lower in patients with total villous atrophy than in the other groups. Most of the abnormal biochemical values were normalized during 1 y of a gluten-free diet; villous atrophy healed concomitantly. To conclude, patients with total mucosal villous atrophy at diagnosis had low erythrocyte folate and serum ferritin values, but no other major differences were found in nutritional status among celiac disease patients with different grades of villous atrophy.},

As certain immunological features are now found in both CoD and healthy persons carrying the HLA DQ2 heterodimer, we sought to establish whether healthy members of the families of CoD patients who are positive for HLA DQ2 and also have increased densities of TCR gammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) in their small bowel mucosa have elevated levels of circulating TCR gammadelta memory cells. Peripheral blood T cells were analysed by flow cytometry in 22 patients with CoD and 16 healthy family members. Untreated CoD patients had higher percentages of circulating CD45RO+ TCR gammadelta cells and CD45RO+ Vdelta1+ cells than healthy family members. On the other hand, the amount of circulating Vdelta1+ lymphocytes was lower in patients with CoD compared with healthy family members. In contrast, no differences were found between HLA DQ2+ and HLA DQ2- healthy family members in respect of circulating TCR gammadelta cell subsets. The change in circulating TCR gammadelta cell subsets found in patients with CoD is thus a consequence of an ongoing immunological process which diminishes on a gluten-free diet rather than a phenomenon directly caused by DQ2. These changes in peripheral blood are not found in healthy individuals who have the same HLA alleles DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0201 encoding the HLA DQ2 and who also have increased densities of TCR gammadelta IEL in their otherwise normal jejunal mucosa.},

Metachronous malignancies are well established in the colon, where adenocarcinoma is common, but are exceptional in the small intestine. We describe a young woman with a long history of malabsorption who was shown to have coeliac disease complicated by a small-bowel adenocarcinoma. The cancer was resected, and the coeliac disease went into complete remission on a strict gluten-free diet. Fifteen years later she developed iron deficiency anaemia. Investigations showed a metachronous small-bowel adenocarcinoma but continuing remission of the coeliac disease. The case provides strong evidence against a causative role for the enteropathy of active coeliac disease in small-bowel adenocarcinoma and against a protective effect of a gluten-free diet in tumour development. Predisposition to adenocarcinoma in coeliac disease is probably genetic.},

In some psychiatric disorders abnormal urinary peptide patterns and peptide levels, and elevated levels of IgA antibodies to food proteins have been detected. These abnormalities are probably due to insufficient breakdown of the proteins gluten and casein. The aim of this study was to discover whether such abnormalities could be found in urine samples and serum of children with dyslexia. After screening 291 pupils in the fourth grade, 15 dyslexics and 15 controls were pairwise matched by gender, age, and cognitive level. Word decoding, spelling, and short-term memory tests were carried out, and information on handedness, immune and other disorders was obtained. Analyses of 24-h urine samples and of serum were performed. The reading abilities significantly differentiated the groups, and significant differences were found in frequency of left-handedness, immune disorders and other disorders. Three dyslexic children had elevated IgA antibodies. Two of these had positive endomycium tests, and coeliac disease was confirmed by biopsy. One had antibodies to proteins in milk. Our findings may suggest weak urinary peptide abnormalities in the dyslexic children, and they show significant differences in levels of IgA of antibodies to food proteins.},

The mean concentration of b-2-m in children with an established diagnosis of CD was 4.38 +/- 1.86 mg/l. In children receiving a gluten-free diet, the mean b-2-m concentration was 1.95 +/- 1.09 mg/l, and in children who received a gluten-containing diet, the concentration was 3.19 +/- 0.71 mg/l. In children with CD who were on a gluten-free diet and who presented no antibodies against EmA in class IgA serum, b-2-m concentration was within the normal range (1.86 +/- 0.55 mg/l). The concentration of b-2-m in children with secondary malabsorption syndrome was within the physiological range (1.77 +/- 0.64 mg/l). In children with IgA-EmA antibodies present in serum, the b-2-m concentration was significantly higher (3.5 +/- 1.23 mg/l; P < 0.001) than that in children with IgA-EmA in serum. We showed a linear dependence between the degree of villous atrophy in CD and concentrations of b-2-m in serum (r2 = 0.94). Determination of b-2-m concentration in sera of children with CD may be used to monitor treatment with a gluten-free diet and to differentiate secondary malabsorption syndrome from CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An improvement in screening for celiac disease has recently been described that uses human umbilical cord as a substitute for monkey esophagus to determine IgA endomysium antibodies in adults. As using monkey esophagus is ethically questionable for large-scale screening, we studied whether substitution of umbilical cord would be suitable for pediatric patients as well. METHODS: Serum from 53 children with untreated celiac disease, 22 in remission and 13 on challenge, were screened for antigliadin IgA, antigliadin IgG, and IgA reticulin antibodies, in addition to IgA endomysium antibodies tested both on monkey esophagus and on human umbilical cord. Controls included 20 patients with cow-milk-sensitive enteropathy, 23 with inflammatory bowel disease, and 23 with diabetes mellitus, and 48 patients who were biopsied to exclude celiac disease either because of positive gliadin antibody test or disturbed growth. RESULTS: Sensitivity (0.94) and specificity (1.0) were similar for umbilical cord and esophageal determinations in active celiac disease. Both substrates detected identical positive cases and neither gave false-positive results. In celiac patients on a gluten-free diet, endomysium antibodies with either substrate were positive in seven identical cases and negative in 15 of 22 cases. Correlations with reticulin antibodies were comparable with human umbilical cord and monkey esophagus (0.83 and 0.85, respectively; Spearman Correlation Section Pair-Wise deletion). CONCLUSIONS: Human umbilical cord is an excellent substitute for monkey esophagus to determine endomysium antibodies in celiac diagnosis in children and adolescents.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of prolonged feeding of gliadin, a major fraction of gluten, on enzyme activities of enterocyte brush border membrane enzymes in rats, mice and pigs. Brush-border membranes were isolated from mucosal scrapings of the small intestine of 21-d-old rat pups hand-fed with formula milk diet, two-month-old nu/nu and +/+ BALB/c mice and two-month-old piglets fed three times a week starting at birth with high doses of gliadin. Activities of lactase, sucrase and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) were determined. Individual animal models differed in their response to gliadin feeding. In comparison with albumin fed controls the activities of DPP IV and lactase were decreased in rat pups, nu/nu BALB/c mice and piglets. DPP IV activity was mostly affected in the ileum of rats and piglets fed with gliadin starting at birth. On the other hand, lactase and sucrase activities of nu/nu BALB/c mice and piglets decreased to the largest extent in jejunum.},

   abstract = {Laparoscopic surgery is rapidly gaining in popularity among general surgeons. It is not widely used to treat abdominal malignancies because of technical difficulties and the fear of peritoneal dissemination. We describe the use of laparoscopic surgery to treat early gastric cancer. A 66-year-old man was diagnosed with early gastric adenocarcinoma by endoscopic ultrasonography and biopsy. Subtotal gastrectomy along with removal of the perigastric (D1) and selective extraperigastric lymph nodes over the celiac trunk was accomplished laparoscopically, through five punctures and a minilaparotomy. The patient's convalescence was uneventful. Bowel sounds were heard on postoperative day 1. On postoperative day 3, he passed flatus. The patient was started on a clear liquid diet on postoperative day 5. There was neither leakage nor obstruction after oral intake. He was discharged on postoperative day 11. No local recurrence or distant metastasis was found during 16 months' follow-up. This is the first report of successful laparoscopic resection of early gastric cancer with lymph node dissection in Taiwan.},

A series of 128 patients with coeliac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD), 8 patients with a newly diagnosed CD, and 30 healthy controls participated in a clinical and histopathological study of their oral mucosa. Oral mucosal lesions occurred in 71/128 GFD-treated CD patients. in 4/8 untreated and in 10/30 controls, and oral symptoms in 85/128, in 6/8 and in 10/30, respectively. Five CD patients had aphthous ulcers. Moderate to severe lymphocytic inflammation occurred in 36/117 and in 14/117 of the biopsy specimens of GFD-treated CD patients, in 1/8 and 2/8 of untreated CD patients, and in 3/30 and in 1/30 of controls, respectively. Intraepithelial T-cells were significantly more frequent in GFD-treated CD patients than in controls. There was no difference between untreated CD patients and controls. In the lamina propria of the GFD-treated CD patients, T-cells were more frequent than in the other groups. Mast cells were significantly more frequent in patients with GFD-treated CD. Nine GFD-treated CD patients had raised serum endomysium IgA antibody titres, although five of them reported to follow a strict GFD. A lack of strict compliance with a GFD may be related to the high prevalence of oral changes and symptoms. In addition, T-cell infiltration in the oral mucosa tends to increase with a longer duration of CD, independent of GFD-treatment. Clinically, it is important to study the oral cavity of patients suspected of having CD where the only clue to the disease may reside, since no less than 66% of the patients in this study had oral symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the new hormonal entity oxyntomodulin-like immunoreactivity in malabsorption states, and to assess its potential in celiac disease management. METHODS: We measured basal and postprandial oxyntomodulin-like immunoreactivity values in 35 children divided into 3 groups: group 1 was composed of 13 children with celiac disease, either under a gluten-free diet (8 patients) or normal diet (5 patients); group 2 was composed of 8 children hospitalized for gastroenteritis or chronic diarrhea, without biological evidence of malabsorption nor abnormal jejunal mucosa; group 3 was composed of 22 control subjects. RESULTS: Fasting and meal-stimulated levels in the control group were 71+/-10 and 130+/-26 pmol/l, respectively. Mean concentrations were elevated in patients with celiac disease (basal = 349+/-254 pmol/l, postprandial = 446+/-332 pmol/l) and in the group 2 (basal = 139+/-58 pmol/l, postprandial = 218+/-85 pmol/l), but the difference with control subjects did not reach statistical significance. In children with celiac disease, basal and stimulated values correlated with the degree of malabsorption as assessed by hemoglobin (p = 0.006 and p = 0.01, respectively) and serum folate concentrations (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Oxyntomodulin-like immunoreactivity is noticeably higher in healthy children than previously measured in healthy adult subjects. This hormonal parameter is not an adequate diagnostic tool in celiac disease. Nevertheless, in the context of celiac disease, its elevation reflects the degree of malabsorption and may provide a quantitative approach of the extent of mucosal damage.},

We report the case of a 14-year old female patient who suffered from a coeliac disease diagnosed in 1988 with considerable improvement with a gluten-free diet. Her two daughters also presented coeliac disease and her sister suffered from nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Four years later, she presented non pruriginous small nodules over both lower extremities. Skin biopsy revealed a non-caseating granuloma into the derm: we only could evocate sarcoidosis affecting the skin. The dermatological lesions improved during the following weeks with a gluten free diet and relapsed each time this diet was stopped. Many clinical associations with coeliac disease have been described with numerous visceral and skin-mucosa involvements. Eight cases of coeliac disease associated with sarcoidosis affecting the lung have been reported: in five cases, coeliac disease preceded sarcoidosis and in one case sarcoidosis relapsed each time gluten was reintroduced like in our case. This two diseases seem to share immunological and genetic disturbances.},

The prevalence rate has increased over the last decades and just 1/3 of cases are diagnosed in childhood. There is a striking association with class II histocompatibility antigens, HLA-DR3 and HLA-DQ2. Cellular immune response mediated by intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes is the primary event in the small intestine damage. Up to 50% of adult coeliac patients don't present intestinal symptoms being more frequent subclinic forms. The immunological markers of coeliac disease are antigliadin, antireticulin and antiendomysial antibodies, being the last one the most specific. Mortality of coeliac patient is increased mainly for malignancies, being the most frequent the intestinal T lymphoma.},

Immunoprecipitation occurred exclusively with 25 coeliac disease serum samples, but with none of the 25 control samples. The 85 kDa antigen was cleaved with endoproteinase Asp-N, and after amino-terminal sequence analysis, the three cleavage products tested all yielded sequences that could be assigned to tissue transglutaminase (EC 2.3.2.13; tTG). In order to prove that tTG obtained from the fibrosarcoma cells binds to the endomysial antibody fraction of coeliac serum IgA, the authors performed indirect immunofluorescence with high titre coeliac disease serum samples on monkey oesophagus with or without prior incubation of those samples with a commercially available tTG extract (Sigma, Deisenhofer, Germany). Pretreatment with tTG almost completely abolished endomysial antibody labelling. Also, when the Sigma tTG was used as antigen in an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 12 coeliac disease patient samples but none of the seven control serum samples displayed increased IgA immunoreactivity. Dieterich et al conclude they have identified tTG as the unknown endomysial autoantigen.},

The effect of a gluten-free diet can be monitored with serological tests. A positive test result often indicates an inadequate gluten-free diet. However, slight dietary transgressions and minor mucosal damages cannot always be revealed with the serological tests. Therefore, small-bowel mucosal biopsy remains the most sensitive method to monitor the effect of a gluten-free diet.},

ANIMALS: Six gluten-sensitive and 12 healthy Irish Setters and 3 healthy Greyhounds. PROCEDURE: Jejunal biopsy specimens were taken at 4 and 12 months of age from the 6 gluten-sensitive Irish Setters, which had been reared on a gluten-free diet to which a controlled dose of gluten (0.5 g/kg of body weight/d) was added. Control specimens were obtained at 4 (n = 5) and 12 (7) months of age from the healthy Irish Setters, which had been fed a conventional gluten-containing diet, and at 4 months of age from the healthy Greyhounds fed the controlled dose of gluten. The specimens were subjected to histologic and ultrastructural examinations and assay of brush border enzymes. RESULTS: Gluten-sensitive Irish Setters developed abnormalities characteristic of GSE at 4 months. Abnormalities were comparable to changes not seen previously until 12 months in dogs with GSE fed a conventional gluten-containing diet. In addition, microvilli were stunted and irregular, and a few were vesiculated and reduced in number; the glycocalyx was reduced or absent. By 12 months of age, there was improvement in morphologic and biochemical parameters, indicating partial recovery despite continued exposure to gluten. CONCLUSIONS: Relative early onset of intestinal damage, compared with that previously reported, and subsequent partial recovery suggestive of oral tolerance to gluten may be attributable to oral administration of gluten as a purified extract rather than in dietary cereal, but alternative explanations include differences in environment or genetic susceptibility to gluten.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The gluten-free diet is the standard therapy for patients affected by celiac disease, although compliance with the diet is not optimal in adolescents or adults. Moreover, the gluten-free diet may induce nutritional imbalances. METHODS: Alimentary habits and diet composition were examined in 47 adolescents with celiac disease and 47 healthy aged-matched control subjects. All subjects compiled a 3-day alimentary record that allowed determination of their energy intakes: the macronutrient composition of their diets; and their iron, calcium, and fiber intakes. To evaluate compliance with the gluten-free diet, immunoglobulin A antigliadin and antiendomysium antibodies were assessed in all with celiac disease. RESULTS: The analysis of the records and the results of antibody levels showed that 25 subjects strictly followed dietetic prescriptions (group 1A), whereas 22 patients consumed gluten-containing food (group 1B). Those with celiac disease and control subjects (group 2) consumed a normocaloric diet. Lipid and protein consumption was high, however, and the consumption of carbohydrates low. Moreover, dietary levels of calcium, fiber, and especially in girls, iron, were low. These nutritional imbalances were significantly more evident in group 1A than in group 1B, as a consequence of poor alimentary choices. Moreover, in group 1A overweight and obesity were more frequent (72%) than in group 1B (51%) and in the control subjects (47%). CONCLUSIONS: In people with celiac disease, adherence to a strict gluten-free diet worsens the already nutritionally unbalanced diet of adolescents, increasing elevated protein and lipid consumption. In the follow-up of patients with celiac disease, considerable effort has yet to be made to improve compliance with a gluten-free diet, and especially to control the nutritional balance of the diet in compliant patients.},

In the present report, we describe a reproducible method for purification of these antigen molecules from fibroblast culture medium. Using reversed-phase chromatography as the final purification step, four different protein molecules reacting with coeliac disease patient sera IgA were obtained. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for coeliac disease-specific IgA, a mixture of 0.5 microgram of the four reversed-phase-separated molecules was used as antigen. The optical density values in ELISA of the sera from newly diagnosed coeliac disease patients (n = 34) were 0.740-3.400 (mean 1.830) and in control patients (n = 66) 0.090-0.850 (mean 0.320). Using an arbitrary cut-off level of 0.700, the sensitivity of the present autoantibody test was 100%, specificity 91% and positive predictive value 85%. Our identified autoantigens may generate the production of the classical tissue antibodies, known as anti-reticulin and anti-endomysium antibodies, and may be used as antigen in an immunoassay for the antibodies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Osteopenia is a common complication of celiac disease. The aims of this study were to evaluate whether treatment produces bone remineralization and whether calcium and vitamin D supplementation are necessary to reduce osteopenia. METHODS: Bone mineral density and biochemical parameters of bone and mineral metabolism were measured in 14 newly diagnosed adult celiac disease patients. All patients were treated with a gluten-free diet and were randomized to receive diet only (n = 7) or diet plus calcium (1.0 g/day) and vitamin D (32,000 IU/wk) supplementation (n = 7). Bone density was measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. Tests for biochemical determinations were repeated every 3 months. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 11 patients had evidence of osteopenia (> 1 SD below normality) in the spine and total skeleton. After 12 months of gluten restriction, overall bone mass had increased 5.0% (p < 0.01) in the lumbar spine and 5.0% (p < 0.002) in the total skeleton. When one only considers those 11 patients who strictly followed gluten restriction, bone density increased 8.4% in the lumbar spine and 7.7% in the total skeleton. Remineralization occurred throughout the skeleton but was more pronounced in the axial than in the peripheral skeleton. The increase in bone mass was independent of age or menopause. Remineralization in patients treated with diet only was similar to that of patients treated with diet and supplements. Basal biochemical parameters showed a high bone turnover with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Treatment induced a decrease in bone turnover activity. However, a complete restoration of biochemical parameters was not achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Strict gluten avoidance promoted a significant increase in bone mineral density. However, values still remain markedly low after 1 yr in several patients. Although calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not provide additional benefit to that obtained by diet alone in the doses administered, our results do not preclude a possible effect of vitamin D at higher dose.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The detection of IgA anti-gliadin antibodies in adults can either be helpful in the diagnosis of coeliac disease, be persistent in subjects with normal jejunal mucosa, or occur transiently. We decided to investigate the effects of smoking, alcohol consumption, and dietary intake on the development of IgA anti-gliadin antibodies. METHODS: Serum samples from subjects enrolled from a large Northern Ireland population sample (MONICA survey) were screened for IgA anti-endomysium and IgA anti-gliadin antibodies. All subjects with positive antibodies were invited for clinical assessment 3-4 years after the initial screening sample. During this follow-up a repeat serum sample was obtained and a jejunal biopsy performed. At enrollment in the MONICA survey, lifestyle information including smoking, alcohol consumption, and dietary intake was obtained. RESULTS: At follow-up 13 subjects had persistent positive serology and villous atrophy, and 9 had persistent positive serology but normal jejunal histology; in 29 the serology had returned to normal, and the jejunal histology was normal There was no difference in smoking, alcohol consumption, or dietary intake between subjects with and without coeliac disease. Subjects with transient serology findings ate significantly more soda bread than the other groups (at the time of initial screening). Analysis of gliadin content of soda bread and plain white bread showed a significantly higher amount of gliadin present in soda bread. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with transient IgA anti-gliadin antibodies eat significantly more soda bread. The gliadin content of Irish soda bread contained a greater amount of gliadin than white bread. Eating breads with high available gliadin content may cause the appearance of anti-gliadin antibody.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse the intake of coeliac disease (CD) inducing, gluten containing cereals (wheat, rye, barley and oats) in Estonian infants diet and compare these results with neighbouring countries with different CD incidence rate. DESIGN: Study group consisted of 32 healthy full term infants of Estonian origin. SETTINGS: Study was carried out in Tartu University Women's Hospital and in Tartu University Children's Hospital. These are both primary care facilities. SUBJECTS: Infants were recruited to the study group according to their health parameters and parents agreement to take part of this study. Material of this article is based on one part of Estonian infants dietary habits investigation. RESULTS: The total amount of gluten containing cereals in Estonian infants diet was lower than in Sweden and Finland. We found that there is a certain parallelism between CD incidence and cereal intake. Wheat intake of Estonian infants was very close to Finnish infants, but almost twice lower than in Swedish infants. CONCLUSION: Data from the study is consistent with the hypothesis that gluten intake during infancy play role in development of CD. The quality of gluten-containing cereals may have important part in the development of the disease.},

   abstract = {The action of tissue Transglutaminase (TGase) on specific protein-bound glutamine residues plays a critical role in numerous biological processes. Here we provide evidence for a new role of this enzyme in the common, HLA-DQ2 (and DQ8) associated enteropathy, celiac disease (CD). The intestinal inflammation in CD is precipitated by exposure to wheat gliadin in the diet and is associated with increased mucosal activity of TGase. This enzyme has also been identified as the main target for CD-associated anti-endomysium autoantibodies, and is known to accept gliadin as one of its few substrates. We have examined the possibility that TGase could be involved in modulating the reactivity of gliadin specific T cells. This could establish a link between previous reports of the role of TGase in CD and the prevailing view of CD as a T-cell mediated disorder. We found a specific effect of TGase on T-cell recognition of gliadin. This effect was limited to gliadin-specific T cells isolated from intestinal CD lesions. We demonstrate that TGase mediates its effect through an ordered and specific deamidation of gliadins. This deamidation creates an epitope that binds efficiently to DQ2 and is recognized by gut-derived T cells. Generation of epitopes by enzymatic modification is a new mechanism that may be relevant for breaking of tolerance and initiation of autoimmune disease.},

In the present study we measured the bone mineral density (BMD) in children and adolescents at diagnosis of celiac disease and after approximately 1 y of a gluten-free diet. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine and in the whole skeleton by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 44 celiac disease patients aged 2.58-20.42 y at diagnosis. BMD was also measured in a subset of 25 patients after 1.4 +/- 0.04 y of a gluten-free diet. BMD was compared with that of 177 healthy control subjects aged 1.52-20.99 y. Lumbar spine and whole-body BMD values at diagnosis of celiac disease were significantly lower than in control subjects (P = 0.015 and P = 0.0001, respectively) after differences in age and anthropomorphic variables were controlled for. The subjects studied after the gluten-free diet had BMD values not significantly different from those of control subjects. In conclusion, children and adolescents with celiac disease have remarkably reduced lumbar spine and whole-body bone density. A gluten-free diet promotes a rapid increase of BMD that leads to a complete recovery of bone mineralization. These results emphasize the need for an early diagnosis and treatment in patients with celiac disease to obtain an adequate peak bone mass at the end of puberty.},

Treatment of pancreatic steatorrhea is described. Throughout this study, we compared characteristics of maldigestion and malabsorption in these patient populations and our study revealed that fecal fat excretion reflected quantitative differences in fat consumption, plasma fatty acid profiles reflected quantitative and qualitative differences in fish oil consumption, and there were no differences in pancreatic exocrine dysfunction among these three groups. Since differences in fecal fat excretion and plasma fatty acid profiles appear to depend on dietary fats, the pathology and treatment of CP patients should be evaluated and the findings used to prescribe treatments.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a chronic disorder of gluten sensitivity associated with a spectrum of mucosal lesions termed preinfiltrative, infiltrative, hyperplastic, destructive, and atrophic. The symptoms are not related to the degree of mucosal pathology but to the extent of the mucosal lesion. Neoplasms constitute the major complication of celiac disease, and EATCL is the most common neoplasm in this category. There is evidence that a strict gluten-free diet is protective against the complications of celiac disease; hence it is important that even the subclinical forms be diagnosed early. Small bowel biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of celiac disease; however, antibody tests are a useful adjunct in deciding whom to biopsy and for screening groups at high risk before initiating a lifelong gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease has a prevalence of between 1/300 and 1/2000 in Europe. A net increase has been observed in the past few years and has been correlated with the greater attention focused on this pathology. The clinical signs may be heterogeneous and their onset may occur at any age. In addition to the classic presentation of the typical malabsorption syndrome, an ''atypical'' presentation has been described, especially in ''adults'', with more frequent involvement of extraintestinal sites and more often in a mono/paucisymptomatic form. The classic variety of coeliac disease is currently thought to be merely the tip of an iceberg whose submerged parts are represented by the subclinical variations, correlated clinical syndromes not yet fully identified and an asymptomatic variety (silent, latent or potential) characterised by various degrees of permanent or transient diet-related alterations to intestinal mucosa. Recently, the association between coeliac disease and epilepsy was described in patients with bilateral occipital calcifications. This study reports the case of a 36-year-old man with manifestations of late onset coeliac disease after a long history of epilepsy starting in infancy and associated with cerebral calcifications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease appears to be a T cell-mediated enteropathy induced by gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Duodenal biopsy specimens from patients with celiac disease and histologically normal controls were investigated to see if cytokine expression is related to disease activity. METHODS: Cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was determined by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ expression by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In normal controls, mRNA levels were usually below the quantitative limit, even after in vitro gluten stimulation. By contrast, interferon (IFN)-gamma mRNA was increased more than 1000-fold in untreated disease. In vitro gluten stimulation of specimens from treated patients (gluten-free diet) increased IFN-gamma mRNA to the levels of untreated patients. In addition, increased mRNA levels for interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were found after such stimulation, whereas mRNA for IL-5, IL-10, and IL-12p40 was usually below the quantitative level. Biopsy specimens from untreated patients contained on average 10-fold more lamina propria cells positive for IFN-gamma than normal controls, whereas cells containing IL-4 were rare in both subject groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that mucosal gluten exposure in patients with celiac disease rapidly elicits high levels of IFN-gamma expression and lower levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha even in the virtual absence of IL-12.},

Therefore, they were immunohistologically characterized with antibodies recognizing CD3, CD8, CD57, T cell-restricted intracellular antigen (TIA-1), and granzyme B (GrB). The TIA-1 labels cytotoxic granules of resting and activated T-cells, whereas GrB decorates activated cytotoxic T cells. Thirty patients with celiac disease, including 20 taking gluten and 10 on a gluten-free diet, 15 patients with nonceliac disease-associated lymphocytic gastritis, and 20 controls were studied. Stained cells were counted and results were given as IELs/100 epithelial cells or percentage of lamina propria cells. Sixty percent to 90% of CD3+ IELs and up to 12% of lamina propria cells contained TIA-1-positive cytotoxic granules. The number of GrB+ IELs and LpLs was increased in Helicobacter pylori-positive controls (p < 0.03 vs. H pylori-negative controls) and celiac disease patients taking gluten (p < 0.05 vs. controls). The highest number of GrB+ IELs and LpLs was found in nonceliac disease-associated lymphocytic gastritis (p < 0.009 vs. controls, p < 0.05 vs. celiac disease). This study shows that a high proportion of gastric IELs and LpLs is potentially cytotoxic in nature. Through stimuli not yet identified, a proportion of them becomes activated after H pylori infestation and in lymphocytic gastritis.},

With this model it was shown that antigens such as ICAM-1 and HLA-DR are upregulated as early as 1-2 h after gliadin challenge in patients with CD. After 24 h the lamina propria contained CD4+ T cells expressing the IL-2 receptor alpha-chain, which is a sign of activation. Intraepithelial lymphocytes increased in number and showed proliferative activity. After in vitro stimulation with gliadin, endomysial antibodies were found in the supernatant of the cultured mucosa from patients with CD following a gluten-free diet. This supported the notion that endomysial antibodies are at least in part produced locally. The model was also successfully used to identify toxic constituents of gliadin. Presently, organ culture is not commonly used for diagnostic purposes.},

Plasma alpha-tocopherol, retinol and lipids were determined in the same samples. The levels of markers of oxidative stress derived from both protein (carbonyl groups) and lipids (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) were significantly higher in celiac disease patients, whereas lipoproteins and alpha-tocopherol were significantly lower. These data indicate that in celiac disease, even when asymptomatic, a redox imbalance persists; this is probably caused by an absorption deficiency, even if slight. Dietary supplementation with antioxidant molecules may offer some benefit and deserves further investigation.},

Under the age of two, 35 children showed subtotal villous atrophy in their initial biopsy but nine of these on subsequent gluten challenge and rebiopsy were found to tolerate gluten normally. Challenge and rebiopsy are also necessary for children over the age of two where the initial biopsy changes are less severe than subtotal villous atrophy. Such challenges can probably be carried out earlier than the recommended age of six given in the 1990 ESPGAN (European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition) report with little risk of serious dental damage.},

An enteric coated enzyme microsphere pancreatic enzyme preparation (Pancrease) has been marketed with several levels of lipase activity, implying that there is a dose-response relationship between dose and effectiveness such that the high potency form appears to be the most cost effective. METHODS: In a randomized, single-blind, cross-over study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a commercial enzyme preparation with different amounts of lipase per dosage unit in adults with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Patients received a diet comprising 100 g fat each day for 6 days. With each meal (three per day) they received two capsules of either Pancrease MT4 (8000 unit lipase), Pancrease MT10 (20,000 units lipase), Pancrease MT16 (32,000 units lipase) or placebo. A 72-h quantitative faecal collection was carried out for the last 3 days of the 6-day period. RESULTS: There was a reduction in faecal fat excretion with each of the preparations compared to placebo. The difference failed to reach significance with the 8000 units lipase preparation (P > 0.05) but was significant (P = 0.02) with the 20,000 units lipase and the 32,000 units lipase preparations (faecal fat excretion: placebo = 42.1 +/- 29 g, lipase 8000 = 22.1 +/- 7.3 g, lipase 20,000 = 10.2 +/- 4.5 g and lipase 32,000 = 15.8 +/- 12.5 g, P < for 20,000 units and 32,000 units lipase compared to placebo). CONCLUSION: A dose-response relationship between the amount of lipase administered with each meal and a reduction in faecal fat was not evident. The most potent preparation did not provide additional benefits compared to the less expensive lower potency dosage form.},

They are associated with several animal diseases and are a potential threat to human health. A total of 127 samples of corn-based foods (gluten-free diet) in the Czech Republic were analysed by Ridascreen Fumonisin Fast ELISA methods in years 1995-1996. Eighty eight % of the corn-based foods were found to be positive for fumonisins (FB1, FB2, FB3) and 12% of the examined corn-based foods laid below of a determination limit which was about 9 ng fumonisins/g corn-based foods. The highest fumonisin contamination levels were recorded in extruded corn products containing up to 1,808 micrograms/kg of fumonisins. Levels ranging from < 9 to 1,243 ng/g fumonisins were detected in polenta. Lower levels of fumonisins were found in other commodities, such as corn flour (up to 487 ng/g), corn instant porridge (up to 788 ng/g), and corn pastes (511 ng/g). Intake of fumonisins from several corn-based foods (gluten-free diet) for the population with coeliac disease was estimated. The highest estimate of exposure dose of fumonisins was determined from corn-extruded bread: 3.2 micrograms/person/day (mean of measured values). Daily intake of fumonisins from polenta is expected 2.8 micrograms/person/day (mean). The lower exposure dose of fumonisins we can expect from corn instant porridge, corn postes and other corn products--corn and amaranth biscuit, corn beverage: 0.9, 1.1 and 0.3 micrograms/person/day (mean) respectively.},

CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old female with a history of two episodes of small bowel ileus due to vascular causes presented with subacute pain in the left lower extremity. Angiography revealed a short segmental occlusion in the P III segment of the popliteal artery with small vessel collateralization and proximal occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery und the coeliac trunk. Vascular risk factors in this patient included smoking over a duration of 10 years, use of oral contraceptives (estrogen and gestagen combination) and elevated levels of homocysteine in the fasting state and after methionin loading. The patient was treated conservatively with intravenous application of prostaglandins, additionally she underwent training to improve her walking capability. After 4 weeks of the fasting state as well as after methionin loading were normalized by an oral substitution with folate and B vitamins. So far it was not possible to prove a genetic defect of the enzymes participating in the metabolism of homocysteine. CONCLUSION: This clinical conference of a young female patient with occlusion of several arteries illustrates the differential diagnosis of premature occlusive vascular disease with special regard to mild hyperhomocysteinemia as an independent risk factor.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty hyperthyroid patients (15 Females and 5 Males, mean age 47 years) were studied. Eight of them had diarrhea and 10 steatorrhea. The control group was composed of 20 healthy volunteers (13 F and 7 M, mean age 49 yrs). OCTT and fecal fat excretion were measured before and after propylthiouracil administration (300 mg/day for 10 day and then 200 mg/day for 30 days). RESULTS: Before the treatment in hyperthyroid patients had began the mean OCTT was significantly lower than in the control group (64 min. versus 107 min; p < 0.0001). After treatment mean OCTT became similar to the controls (p = ns); diarrhea disappeared in all affected patients and mean fecal fat excretion was reduced from 7.9 gr/24h to 3.4 gr/24h, with a statistically significantly difference (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The treatment with propylthiouracil induces the normalization of thyroid hormone status and consequently of OCTT with the disappearance of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and steatorrhea, with a better efficacy if compared to other drugs utilized in the treatment of hyperthyroidism.},

In this study, we examined whether increased numbers of gamma/delta TcR positive lymphocytes occur in the oral mucosa of patients with DH. Oral and jejunal mucosal biopsies were taken from 13 newly diagnosed and 13 gluten free diet (GFD)-treated patients with DH. Monoclonal antibodies and avidin-biotin peroxidase method was used for staining, and TcR positive cells were counted from the buccal and jejunal epithelium. Very few gamma/delta TcR positive lymphocytes were seen in the buccal epithelium of untreated or GFD-treated DH patients (median 0.4 and 0.3 cells/mm2), whereas alpha/beta TcR positive lymphocytes were frequent in both groups of DH patients (154 and 250 cells/mm2) and healthy controls (135 cells/mm2). The numbers of gamma/delta TcR positive intraepithelial lymphocytes were significantly increased in the jejunum of both untreated (43 cells/mm) and GFD-treated (27 cells/mm) DH patients compared to control patients (2.2 cells/mm). The present study did not, therefore, disclose any evidence for active recruitment of gamma/delta TcR positive lymphocytes in the oral epithelium, but showed substantial amounts of intraepithelial alpha/beta TcR positive lymphocytes both in DH patients and healthy controls.},

Jejunal biopsies taken from eight-month-old GSE-affected dogs reared on a normal, gluten-containing diet exhibited partial villous atrophy and contained more intra-epithelial lymphocytes than controls. The morphological abnormalities were reversed by feeding a gluten-free diet for five months and the changes were accompanied by an increase in the mucosal activity of the microvillar hydrolases, particularly aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV, which reverted to pre-treatment levels after a gluten challenge. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of microvillar membrane proteins isolated from GSE-affected dogs revealed an essentially normal protein map that was comparable to controls. The exception was an intense 85 kDa protein spot that diminished when the affected dogs were fed a gluten-free diet and re-intensified after a gluten challenge.},

   abstract = {Recent studies using the technique of the human genome screening in families with multiple siblings suffering from coeliac disease have suggested the presence of at least four different chromosomes in the predisposition to suffer from coeliac disease. Two loci in chromosome 6 appear to be important in disease susceptibility. Other studies based on cytokine gene polymorphisms have found a strong association with a particular haplotype in the TNF locus. This haplotype carries a gene for a high secretor phenotype of TNFalpha. The finding may be important in understanding the heterogeneity of inflammatory response. Evidence has been presented in favour of a predominantly Th1 pattern of cytokine production by the coeliac disease associated HLA-DQ restricted T cell clones. HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 restricted gliadin-specific T cells have been shown to produce IFN-gamma, which appears to be an indispensable cytokine in the damage to enterocytes encountered in the small intestine, since the histological changes can be blocked by anti-IFN-gamma antibodies in vitro. TNF-alpha, also produced by several T cell clones, may in conjunction with IFN-gamma have a toxic effect or enhance the IFN-gamma-induced increase of HLA-class II expression on surface enterocytes. In the lamina propria this leads to an increased expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 on T lymphocytes and macrophages. Th1 cells also activate cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that migrate in the epithelial layer, and stimulate further LPL macrophages to produce IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha enhancing the inflammatory response. During this process autoreactive T cells proliferate, creating a situation which is very similar to the process that takes place in autoimmune diseases. Occasionally, this inflammatory destruction of the small intestinal integrity initiated by gluten peptides goes further and develops into a proper autoimmune disease which requires the use of immunosuppressive drugs in addition to a gluten-free diet.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the intraduodenal lipase activity in patients with celiac disease by means of the 13C mixed-triglyceride breath test and to monitor pancreatic function after the institution of a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Seventeen untreated patients with celiac disease (mean age, 17.4 +/- 10.5 years) were studied. After an overnight fast, patients were given a standard test meal consisting of 100 g of white bread and 0.25 g of butter per kilogram of body weight, to which 16 mg di-stearyl-13C-octanoyl-glyceride (mixed triglyceride) had been added. Breath samples were taken twice at baseline and at 30-minute intervals for 6 hours after the meal. 13C enrichment in breath was determined by means of Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (IRMS) (ANCA-NT; Europa Scientific, Crewe, UK). Results were expressed as the maximum percentage of 13C recovery per hour at any time, the time to reach peak excretion of 13C, and the percentage of 13C cumulative dose over 6 hours. RESULTS: Mixed-triglyceride breath test results were pathologic in three patients and at the lower limit of the normal range in another patient. In the remaining 13 patients, the results were within normal values. At the 6- and 12-month follow-ups, all patients showed normal intraduodenal lipase activity. CONCLUSIONS: In approximately 24% of patients with celiac disease, the intraduodenal pancreatic lipolytic activity is impaired. The mixed-triglyceride breath test could be used to assess fat maldigestion and to monitor the need for enzyme replacement therapy in such patients.},

J., and T. L. Powley. Am. J. Physiol. 271 (Regulatory Integrative Comp. Physiol. 40): R766-R779, 1996]. To evaluate the contributions of the vagus to this detection of gastric volume, groups prepared with different selective vagotomies and equipped with pyloric cuffs and gastric catheters were tested. Liquid diet consumption during a 30-min feeding bout was measured after infusions of 5.0 and 10.0 ml of normal saline on cuff-open and cuff-closed trials. Consistent with earlier observations, sham animals with cuffs closed exhibited volume-dependent suppression of food intake to the infusions, and completely vagotomized animals did not inhibit feeding in response to the loads. In cuff-closed trials, the suppression function slopes of the selective vagotomy groups were intermediate to those of the shams and the completely vagotomized animals. Furthermore, for the different groups, the extent of suppression after vagotomy was proportional to the density of the afferent innervation respective branches supplied to the stomach. Specifically, the group with the gastric branches spared (nonsignificantly attenuated in comparison to shams) and the group with only the hepatic branch spared (significantly attenuated with respect to shams) both still exhibited significant dose-dependent suppression slopes (compared with completes), whereas the group with only celiac branches spared was not significantly different from completely vagotomized animals. In sum, the vagus nerve mediates the detection of the gastric volumes tested, and the different branches of the vagus make distinctive contributions to this afferent feedback.},

A group of celiac disease (CD) patients was used as index population. METHODS: Stool fat, nitrogen, and water were measured with near-infrared analysis of 1- and 3-day stool collections in 96 celiac disease patients on a free diet (in 39 also on gluten-free diet) and in 96 matched controls and 14 patients with latent CD. RESULTS: The fecal output of fat, nitrogen, and water was significantly increased in free-diet CD, whereas their percentage content was only slightly modified compared with controls. None of the variables under consideration differed significantly between the 24-h and 72-h stool specimens. CONCLUSION: Our data show that the high value of fecal fat, nitrogen, and water, in celiac disease, are mainly due to the fecal weight, whereas the percentage composition of stool does not offer additional diagnostic information. Furthermore, 3-day stool collection is not necessary to confirm or rule out malabsorption in most patients. Near infrared analysis of 24-h specimens is time- and cost-effective and may increase the use of stool analysis and be usefully employed to monitor the clinical follow-up of patients with chronic diarrhea.},

   abstract = {Abdominal pain, excruciating and recurrent, is the dominant feature of chronic pancreatitis that initially brings most of the patients to the physician's attention. The pathogenesis of pancreatic pain is often multifactorial and explains why not all patients respond to the same mode of therapy. Increased intraductal pressure as a result of ductal stricture and/or calculi is the most frequent cause for pain in the large majority of patients with large duct disease. Interstitial hypertension, ongoing pancreatic ischemia, neuronal inflammation, and extra pancreatic complications may be the sole or additional factors in the pathogenesis of pain. The management of pain is difficult and requires a team approach. Internist, gastroenterologist, radiologist, surgeon, and a psychiatrist may have to work together to achieve maximum success. Drug and alcohol dependency needs vigorous management by a psychiatrist. Supportive therapy with a low-fat diet and antioxidant supplementation are helpful. When analgesic therapy fails, surgery may have to be considered much before a narcotic dependency develops. If at all of use, oral pancreatic enzyme therapy is suitable only in a selected group of patients--women with idiopathic pancreatitis. Endoscopic papillotomy, stent placement, and stone removal, although becoming popular, are under trial only and appear to be suitable in those with obstructive disease mostly localized to the head of the pancreas without much proximal disease. A patient with a dilated duct system is a good candidate for Puestow's pancreatico-jejunal anastamosis, which appears to be the best surgical procedure. Those with small duct diseases are difficult to be managed. Resective procedures and celiac ganglion blocking are suggested but not of much help.},

It is the 13th such case that has been published over the last 25 years and only the 7th to be reported in a child. We believe that the concurrence of these two diseases is not coincidental, because a gluten-free diet had beneficial effects on the pulmonary symptoms not only in our case but also in other such patients. However, the pathogenetic relation between IPH and CD remains unclear. Although circulating immune complexes were detected in our patient's serum, there was no evidence of their putative damaging effect on the basement membrane of the alveolar capillaries. Furthermore, no IgA deposits could be demonstrated in alveolar basement membranes. Therefore the hypothesis that there is a reaction between IgA reticulin or endomysial antibodies and an alveolar basement membrane antigen with consecutive structural damage is unlikely.},

METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 4 patients with active CD on a gluten-containing diet, 11 biopsy-proven CD patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD), and 52 non-coeliac gastrointestinal controls. In all patients IgA antigliadin antibody (AGA) titres were determined with enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), and IgA antiendomysium antibodies (EMA) with indirect immunofluorescence on human umbilical cord. Cryostat sections of human brain occipital cortex were incubated with the patients' sera and subsequently labelled with anti-human IgA fluorescein conjugate. RESULTS: All sera from patients with active CD on a gluten-containing diet yielded positive results in both the IgG-AGA and EMA test and in indirect immunofluorescence on brain tissue, disclosing a strong fluorescence over blood-vessels structures. All sera from CD patients on a GFD and from non-coeliac gastrointestinal controls gave a negative result on both the EMA test and the immunofluorescence reaction on human brain. CONCLUSIONS: Sera from patients with active CD contain IgA antibodies that react with human brain vessel structures, giving intense fluorescence. These antibodies are not present in sera from coeliac patients on a GFD or non-coeliac controls. This finding might be involved in the abnormal nervous system manifestations frequently described in association with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bone metabolism may be disturbed in children with celiac disease. METHODS: Two markers of bone turnover were used: the level of osteocalcin (BGP) and the level of carboxylterminal peptide of type I procollagen (PICP). BGP and PICP were measured by radioimmunoassays in 18 untreated children with celiac disease (mean age: 22.9 +/- 15.6 months) and in 15 control subjects (mean age 28.5 +/- 21 months). All the patients were rechecked after 1 month and again after 3 months from beginning of a gluten-free diet (GFD). RESULTS: Compared with controls at diagnosis our patients had significantly lower serum levels of BGP and PICP (p = 0.003 and p = 0.018 by Student's t test, respectively). These levels increased markedly during the 1st 3 months of GFD. CONCLUSIONS: The alteration in calcium phosphate homeostasis caused by celiac disease directly affects the synthesis of both components of the connective matrix of bone. Measurements of BGP and PICP provide a reliable and rapidly obtainable index of normalization of the processes of bone growth which can be achieved with a GFD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a genetic, immunologically mediated small bowel enteropathy that causes malabsorption. The immune inflammatory response to gluten frequently causes damage to many other tissues of the body. The condition is frequently underdiagnosed because of its protean presentations. New prevalence data indicate that symptomatic and latent celiac disease is present in one of 300 people of European descent. Age of onset ranges from infancy to old age. Symptomatic presentations include general ill-health, as well as dermatologic, hematologic, musculoskeletal, mucosal, dental, psychologic and neurologic diseases. Celiac disease has a 95 percent genetic predisposition and, thus, it is frequently associated with autoimmune conditions such as diabetes mellitus type 1 and thyroid disease. Untreated patients have an increased incidence of osteoporosis and intestinal lymphoma. Excellent diagnostic screening tests are now available, including those that detect antigliadin and antiendomysial antibodies. Therapy with a gluten-free diet is effective, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms and secondary complications in almost all patients. Local and national celiac-sprue associations facilitate care of patients with celiac disease and support dietary compliance.},

Some patients with celiac disease develop osteoporosis and arthritis responsive to a gluten-free diet. It seems that osteoporosis is a frequent feature in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and steroid use is an important risk factor. The use of steroids in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has generated medicolegal questions. This year a wealth of information has been published regarding hepatitis C virus infection. Arthritis, myopathy, and antibody production are some of the reported manifestations of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. There is evidence that may link chronic hepatitis C virus infection with the antiphospholipid syndrome.},

CD activity was assessed by intestinal biopsy to determine intestinal atrophy histologically and by measuring the level of antiendomysial antibody titer. TTR was measured in 26 CD patients fed a diet containing gluten and 22 CD patients fed a gluten-free diet. The control group was composed of 65 healthy sex- and age-matched children. We compared the TTR levels to the two established markers of CD activity. TTR levels were lowest among the celiac patients fed a diet containing gluten and differed significantly from those of the other two groups (r = 0.7, p < 0.002). The TTR levels correlated inversely with both the degree of mucosal atrophy (r = 0.6, p < 0.005) and with anti-endomysial antibody titers (p < 0.005). TTR levels appear to be correlated with morphologic and serologic markers of activity in celiac patients. TTR can be used as a systemic parameter in assessing celiac patients. It can contribute information to the evaluation of children in whom celiac disease is suspected, and it can monitor patients' diet compliance.},

The following associations were found: auto-immune thyroid disease (4.3% of DH patients and 6.0% of CD patients), insulin dependent diabetes (1.0% DH and 5.5% CD), lupus erythematosus (1.3% DH and 0.3% CD), Sjogren's syndrome (1.0% DH and 2.9% CD), sarcoidosis (1.3% DH and 1.8% CD), and vitiligo or alopecia areata (1.6% DH and 0% CD). We have shown that patients with DH are similar to those with CD in that many have associated endocrine or connective tissue disorders. Most of these diseases began before DH had been diagnosed suggesting that those on a gluten-free diet are not at special risk of contracting them.},

The presence of a rash is also a sensitive indicator of gluten ingestion in dermatitis herpetiformis, and this was used to study whether patients with this disease could also tolerate oats. PATIENTS/METHODS: Eleven patients with dermatitis herpetiformis in remission on a gluten-free diet were challenged daily with 50 g oats for six months. Clinical symptoms were recorded, serum samples taken, and skin and small bowel biopsies performed before and after the oat challenge. A control group comprised of 11 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis on a conventional gluten-free diet was also studied. RESULTS: Eight patients challenged with oats remained asymptomatic, two developed a transient rash, and one withdrew because of the appearance of a more persistent but mild rash. Three of the 11 controls also developed a transient rash. IgA endomysial antibodies remained negative in all patients. The small bowel villous architecture, the densities of intraepithelial CD3 and alpha/beta and gamma/delta T cell receptor positive lymphocytes and crypt epithelial cell DR expression remained unaltered during the oat challenge. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the absence of oat toxicity on the gluten sensitive small bowel mucosa and suggest that the rash in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis is not activated by eating oats.},

IgA-deficiency was ruled out in all patients. Positivity was considered for titers > 30.3 UA obtained from controls. The AAG-IgA titer was positive in 9 of 10 celiac patients on P1. Nine of these 10 patients were tested on P2; all cases showed a decrease in the AAG-IGA level and a significant difference was observed between the mean values for P1 and P2; although seven patients had maintained positive titers. On P3 and P4 all patients had AAG-IGa negative levels. On P1 the AAG-IGA liter levels were significantly higher than the values for P2, P3 and P4. The AAG-IgA values decreased towards control levels after one year of treatment. In Group III one out of 14 patients had a positive titer and the AAG-IgA values in this group were significantly lower than the celiac titers on P1 and P2 and no difference was found compared to patients titers on P3 and P4. The sensitivity of ELISA test was 90% and the specificity 93%. The AAG-IgA determination proved to be reliable for differentiating celiac disease from food hypersensitivity and useful in monitoring gluten-free diet compliance.},

   abstract = {This review reevaluates the rational basis for choice of diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected malassimilation. Prospective evaluation of diagnostic tests must fulfil several requirements for a correct assessment of their clinical value. Very few studies meet such requirements, resulting in unnecessary investigations as well as overlooked cases with a negative impact on patients and society. This problem includes evaluation of assimilation of macronutrients (carbohydrate, fat, protein) as well as micronutrients (e.g. vitamin B12), and it is further complicated by the occurrence of conditions with occult (compensated) malassimilation. Malassimilation of carbohydrates may be physiological (starch, fructose, sugar alcohols etc., in certain ethnic groups lactose) as well as pathological. In both instances chronic gastro-intestinal distress may arise in sensitive individuals. The diagnosis is based on tolerance tests, combined with blood tests or breath tests (hydrogen excretion). The latter is considered the most reliable, but the available evidence for choice of tests is not solid. Similar reservations apply to conditions of bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine, which may lead to diffuse malassimilation. The frequency and clinical importance of this condition is in all probability underestimated. Screening for coeliac disease may be achieved by several serological tests (reticulin-, gliadin-, endomysial antibodies), of which IgA-endomysial antibodies seem superior. Comparative studies are often flawed in design, however, and permeability tests may also eventually find their place in the test battery. There is thus a strong need for more evidence-based diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected malassimilation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease may be associated with a wide variety of diseases of known or suspected immunological aetiology. OBJECTIVE: To screen for both (a) the prevalence of coeliac disease in adults with autoimmune thyroid diseases, and (b) thyroid impairment among adults with coeliac disease, as compared to sex- and age-matched controls. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: University teaching hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 152 consecutive adults with autoimmune thyroid diseases, 185 consecutive coeliac disease patients (53 newly diagnosed and 132 already on a gluten-free diet) and 170 sex- and age-matched controls. METHODS: Screening for coeliac disease was done by means of IgA anti-endomysium antibodies, detected by indirect immunofluorescence on monkey oesophagus. Patients with positive sera underwent duodenal biopsy for diagnostic confirmation. Thyroid function was assessed by measuring the levels of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone, free T3, free T4, thyroperoxidase and thyroid microsome antibodies. Autoimmune thyroid diseases were classified according to the American Thyroid Association guidelines. RESULTS: Anti-endomysium antibodies were positive in five of 152 autoimmune thyroid disease patients (3.3%) and coeliac disease was histologically confirmed in all: this prevalence is 10-fold higher than expected. Only one patient presented with gastrointestinal complaints, but iron deficiency was found in three and alterations at bone mineralometry in all. The overall prevalence of autoimmune thyroid diseases was significantly higher (38/185, 20.5%) in coeliac patients than in controls (19/170, 11.2%). The prevalence of both hypo- and hyperthyroidism was not different from that of controls, while the prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease with euthyroidism was 13% in patients and 4.7% in controls. CONCLUSIONS: The association of coeliac disease with autoimmune thyroid disease is not surprising as they share common immunopathogenetic mechanisms. It is advisable to screen autoimmune thyroid disease patients for coeliac disease as there is an increased risk for gluten intolerance. In contrast, thyroid function assessment in coeliac disease patients is probably less justified, although the need for a strict clinical follow-up of those patients with euthyroidism and autoimmune thyroid disease, who could develop overt thyroid impairment, remains an open question.},

We explored the age-dependent changes in intraepithelial gamma/delta and alpha/beta TCR+ cells from 137 biopsies from patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis and from controls. Biopsy specimens from 100 patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis and from 37 controls were studied with an immunohistochemical method using MoAbs to T cell receptors and peroxidase staining. An increase in the density of intraepithelial gamma/delta T cells above the mean +2 s.d. of the density in controls was present in 97 of 100 specimens from patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis. The density of gamma/delta+ cells of patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis on a normal gluten-containing diet showed a positive correlation with age (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001). In controls, the density of gamma/delta+ cells remained low throughout the age-range studies, from age 0.6-57 years. In controls, alpha/beta+ cells increased with age (r = 0.57, P < 0.001). The increase in density of intraepithelial lymphocytes with age is in agreement with their thymus-independent character and local proliferation.},

   abstract = {We have developed a model of autonomic nervous system aging using the mouse superior cervical sympathetic ganglion (SCG) which is characterized by the reproducible development of distinctive, markedly-enlarged neuritic swellings (vacuolar neuritic dystrophy, VND). These structures contained an admixture of lucent vacuoles and subcellular organelles, and involved both presynaptic and postsynaptic ganglionic elements. Quantitation of the frequency of VND was accomplished at the light microscopic level and validated by ultrastructural examination. VND lesions were 30-100-fold more frequent in the aged mouse paravertebral SCG than in the prevertebral celiac/superior mesenteric (C/SMG) sympathetic ganglia. Although VND was identified in all ages of mice examined, the number of lesions increased significantly with age. The frequency of VND was a function of the strain of mouse examined with a 40-fold difference in VND frequency between C57BL6 mice, the least involved strain, and the DBA/2J strain, which was most affected and began to develop significant numbers of lesions at an early age. As in our human studies of aging in the sympathetic nervous system, there was a prominent gender effect with males developing twofold greater numbers of VND lesions than females. Mice maintained on a significant calorie restricted diet for 30 months developed 70% fewer lesions than ad libitum-fed, age and sex matched controls. The aging mouse SCG, therefore, represents a robust animal model with reproducible, quantifiable and unambiguous neuropathology. Insights into pathogenetic mechanisms gained in the subsequent analysis of this relatively simple peripheral sympathetic nervous system model may contribute to the understanding of some of the most complex and significant problems involving higher brain function.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the diagnostic potential and accuracy of CDS in the diagnosis and management of visceral artery stenosis in young patients with abdominal pain. METHOD: 126 patients < 45 y with abdominal pain were examined by CDS. Other diseases were excluded before. Systolic (Vmax.sys.) and end diastolic (Vmax.diast.) peak velocities in exspiration and inspiration were measured in the celiac (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Vmax.syst. > 1.8 m/s in exspiration and inspiration was regarded as a respiratory fixed stenosis. This was followed by intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (i.a. DSA) including visualization of the pancreaticoduodenal artery (PDA), and, if fixed stenosis was confirmed, by operation. CDS was again performed in the follow-up. RESULTS: CA stenosis were found in 19 patients (mean age 28.9 y). 4 were respiratory fixed, 2 combined with SMA stenoses or occlusion, all proved by i.a. DSA. The others had no evidence of fixed CA stenoses. The 4 operated patients were postoperatively immediately well. One with intermediate pain again had a stenosis in the SMA-bypass which was successfully treated by PTA. The others were treated with dietary procedures and regularly controlled by CDS. CONCLUSION: Ligamentary CA stenosis in young patients is rare, but may lead to considerable abdominal pain and weight loss. Hemodynamicly significant stenoses are proved by CDS with respiratory fixed Vmax.syst. > 1.8 m/s and Vmax.diast. > or = 1 m/s; i.a. DSA often shows a retrograde perfusion of the PDA. Such patients should be treated surgically. CDS should be performed in the follow-up.},

   abstract = {Tight junction morphology was analyzed in freeze fracture electron micrographs from biopsies at two locations along the surface-crypt axis in the jejunum of children with treated and untreated sprue and in control subjects. In control jejunum, strand number, meshwork depth, and total depth of the tight junction decreased from surface to crypt, consistent with the concept of the crypt being more permeable than the surface epithelium. In acute sprue, strand number was reduced in all regions along the surface-crypt axis, from 5.5+/-0.2 to 3.4+/-0.3 (surface) and from 4.7+/-0.2 to 3.6+/-0.1 (crypt). Meshwork depth was also reduced at all regions along the surface-crypt axis. Strand discontinuities were more frequent in acute sprue. Aberrant strands appeared below the main meshwork of crypt tight junctions in acute sprue. In asymptomatic children treated with the gluten-free diet, jejunal tight junctional structure only partially recovered. Strand number was restored to normal at the surface, but was still decreased in the crypts, from 4.7+/-0.2 to 3.9+/-0.3. We conclude that the epithelial barrier function of the small intestine is seriously disturbed by structural modifications of the tight junction in acute symptomatic celiac disease, thereby accounting for increased ionic permeability noted in a parallel study on identical specimens. This epithelial barrier defect may contribute to diarrhea in celiac disease by a "leak flux mechanism." In children with sprue treated with a gluten-free diet, barrier dysfunction was only partly recovered, suggesting a level of "minimal damage."},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to establish whether body composition in patients with celiac disease is normal and influenced by the age at diagnosis or by the duration of the gluten free diet. METHODS: A group of 66 children with celiac disease and 76 healthy controls were studied by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. We compared celiac patients with the control group, and within the celiac disease group, we compared patients with different age at diagnosis (28 diagnosed in the first 24 months vs 38 later) and with different duration of the diet (16 in gluten free diet for less than 12 months, 11 for less than 24 months, and 39 for more than 24 months). RESULTS: Overall we did not find any significant difference in body composition between overall celiac patients and controls. However the fat mass, the body mass index, and the spine bone mineral density values in late diagnosed celiac patients were significantly lower than in early diagnosed patients (significance values were p < 0.009; p < 0.002; p < 0.002, respectively). Patients on diet for less than 12 months showed significantly lower bone mineral content and density than those on diet for more than 24 months (significance values were, respectively, p < 0.011 and p < 0.022). Spine mineral density was the only parameter significantly influenced both by age at diagnosis (p < 0.03) and duration of gluten free diet (p < 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Only an early diagnosis of celiac disease in pediatric age and a strict gluten free diet, lasting more than 12 months, allow celiac patients to reach a normal mineralization.},

In physiologic and pathologic circumstances this process may involve effector and target cells. METHODS: To identify serine esterase granules in intraepithelial lymphocytes, fresh-frozen human small intestine mucosal sections from normal and celiac-affected mucosa were incubated with substrate-specific N-alpha-benzyloxy-carbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl (BLT) and a chromogen (4 Benzoylamino-2,5-diethoxybenzene-dazonium chloride hemi [zinc chloride] salt as capture agent and were examined by light microscopy. RESULTS: Normal mucosa showed an occasional intraepithelial lymphocyte with BLT-positive intracytoplasmic granules. Some large mononuclear cells of the lamina propria were similarly stained. Many more intraepithelial lymphocytes were BLT-positive among the surface enterocytes of untreated celiac mucosa. Lamina propria mononuclear cells close to the basal layer of crypt cells also appeared to be increased. CONCLUSIONS: The histochemical identification of BLT-positive esters within intraepithelial lymphocytes suggests their involvement in enterocyte death under physiologic conditions. The increased BLT-positive intraepithelial lymphocytes found in the celiac mucosa may be related to the known increase in cytotoxic intraepithelial lymphocytes in untreated celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiorgan upper gut transplantation is becoming clinically feasible; however, the effects of multivisceral transplantations on gastrointestinal motility are unknown. Our aim was to determine the neural and hormonal mechanisms controlling motility patterns after complete extrinsic denervation of the upper gut as a model of multivisceral upper gut autotransplantation. METHODS: Seven dogs successfully underwent in situ neural isolation of the stomach, entire small intestine, proximal colon, liver, and pancreas by transecting all connections (distal esophagus, midcolon, all nerves, lymphatics) to this multivisceral complex except the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and the suprahepatic and infrahepatic vena cava; these vessels were meticulously stripped of adventitia under optical magnification. Blood flow was not disrupted to prevent confounding effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury. After 1- to 2-week recovery, myoelectric and manometric recordings of stomach and myoelectric recordings of small bowel were obtained from conscious animals. RESULTS: During fasting the characteristic cycling migrating motor complex (MMC) was observed in the stomach and small intestine. The gastric component of the MMC was absent in one of the seven dogs. Regular cycling of the MMC during fasting, however, was intermittently disrupted and replaced by a noncyclic pattern of intermittent contractions in two of seven dogs 43% of the recording time. A small meal (50 gm liver) did not abolish the MMC as occurs in normal dogs; in contrast, a large meal (500 gm liver) did abolish the MMC. CONCLUSIONS: Extrinsic innervation to the upper gut modulates but is not requisite for interdigestive and postprandial motility of the stomach. Because relatively normal global motility patterns are preserved, multivisceral upper gut transplantation should be a viable option in selected patients.},

A sural nerve biopsy showed marked loss of myelinated fibres without evidence of regenerative phenomena. Distal involvement and features of nerve pathology are consistent with a "dying-back" mechanism to underlie the nerve damage.

The measurement of sucrose permeability is proposed as a novel means to detect upper gastrointestinal damage, with potentially greater use than conventional methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of sucrose in the detection of celiac disease. METHODS: Permeability tests were performed in 27 newly diagnosed patients, at diagnosis, after upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed to exclude macroscopic gastric lesions, and after 2 months on a gluten-free diet. Results were compared with those obtained in 30 healthy subjects and 7 patients with chronic diarrhea but no evidence of celiac disease. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 25 of 27 patients had increased urinary excretion of sucrose. Mean sucrose excretion in patients with untreated celiac disease was significantly increased compared with healthy controls and controls with disease. Sucrose excretion decreased significantly after treatment and completely normalized in 60% of patients. The lactulose-mannitol ratio was abnormal in 26 of 27 patients, with a mean value significantly greater than that observed in healthy controls. This ratio also significantly declined after treatment; however, no values returned to the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Increased sucrose permeability is a sensitive marker for advanced celiac disease. Moreover, it decreases rapidly in response to a gluten-free diet and therefore is potentially useful to follow response to therapy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This prospective study was designed to assess the nutritional changes associated with the long-term treatment of celiac disease. In addition, we analyzed whether these changes were related to the degree of compliance with a gluten-free diet. METHODS: We studied nutritional parameters and body composition in 25 newly diagnosed celiac patients after a mean period of 37 months (range 25-49 months) on a gluten-free diet. Body composition parameters (fat, lean tissue, and bone masses) were measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Anthropometry was measured according to conventional formulas. RESULTS: At diagnosis, fat (-49%), lean tissue (-12%), and bone (-24%) compartments were reduced, compared with that of sex- and age-matched controls. After treatment, we noted a significant increase in body weight (p < 0.0001), fat mass (p < 0.0005), bone mass (p < 0.002), and body mass index (p < 0.005). In contrast, we did not observe a significant increase in lean-tissue mass or muscle mass. Patients who adhered strictly to a gluten-free diet experienced a greater, though nonsignificant improvement in fat mass, body weight, and body mass index than patients whose compliance had been partial. Mean caloric intake at the end of the study was significantly lower among those patients who had adhered strictly to a gluten-free diet, compared with those who had complied only partially with the diet (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the institution of a gluten-free diet in celiac disease patients results in a significant improvement in nutritional parameters, as measured by anthropometry and/or body composition. This effect was more pronounced in patients who followed strict gluten restriction and was related mainly to changes in fat and bone compartments.},

   abstract = {Accumulating evidence indicates that coeliac disease (CD) is a multifactorial disorder where several heritable factors in conjunction with environmental factors are involved in the disease development. Gluten proteins are a critical environmental factor as the presence of disease in affected individuals is strictly dependent on dietary gluten exposure. Most likely coeliac patients have genetically shaped immune responses to gluten proteins that cause intestinal pathology. Many of the CD genes thus supposedly encode variants of proteins with immune functions. HLA has been identified as a major genetic factor, but yet no further genes have been identified. There probably exist several predisposing non-HLA genes, but available data indicate that the heritable contribution by each of them can be small. Combined genetic and functional studies will hopefully identify additional predisposing genes in the future.},

   abstract = {Tacrine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, reversible hepatotoxicity in about 30% of patients at therapeutic doses limits clinical use. The purpose of this study was to develop and characterize a model of tacrine hepatotoxicity to begin to understand the mechanisms of injury. Rats were given tacrine (10-50 mg/kg, intragatrically) and killed 24 hr later. An increase in serum aspartate aminotransferase was observed up to 35 mg/kg and histology revealed pericentral necrosis and fatty changes. Aspartate aminotransferase was increased from 12 to 24 hr and returned to control values by 32 hr. Livers were perfused in a nonrecirculating system to measure oxygen uptake and trypan blue was infused at the end of each experiment to evaluate tissue perfusion. Time for trypan blue to distribute evenly throughout the liver 3 hr after tacrine treatment was significantly increased (6.9 +/- 1.3 min) compared to controls (1.0 +/- 0.3 min) reflecting decreased tissue perfusion. Tacrine also significantly increased the binding of a hypoxia marker, pimonidazole, in pericentral regions almost 3-fold, and increased portal pressure in vivo significantly. It is hypothesized that tacrine, by inhibiting acetylcholine breakdown in the celiac ganglion, increases sympathetic activity in the liver leading to vascular constriction, hypoxia and liver injury. To test this hypothesis, the hepatic nerve was severed and animals were allowed to recover before tacrine treatment. This procedure significantly reduced serum aspartate aminotransferase, time of dye distribution, pimonidazole binding and portal pressure. Furthermore, a free radical adduct was detected with spin trapping and electron spin resonance spectroscopy 8 hr after tacrine treatment, providing evidence for reoxygenation. When catechin (100 mg/kg, i.p.), a free radical scavenger, was given before tacrine, injury was decreased by about 45%. Furthermore, feeding 5% arginine in the diet significantly reduced portal pressure and time of dye distribution. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that tacrine hepatotoxicity is a hypoxia-reoxygenation injury mediated through the sympathetic nervous system.},

Brush border enzyme activity and morphological assessment were performed on small intestinal biopsies in 27 of the treated coeliac patients. RESULTS: Forty per cent of untreated coeliac patients and 18% of treated coeliac patients had abnormal tests. In treated coeliac patients, no significant correlation was detected between the pancreolauryl test result and either brush border enzyme activity or morphological parameters. CONCLUSION: Abnormal pancreolauryl test results are common in untreated and treated adult coeliac disease patients. Abnormalities in treated coeliac patients do not correlate with the degree of recovery of small intestinal morphology or brush border enzymes.},

Nitric oxide has been shown to affect mucosal permeability after ischemia-reperfusion, but little is known about the regulatory role of nitric oxide in celiac disease. The purpose of this study was to assess nitric oxide production in children with celiac disease and in control subjects. METHODS: The sum of nitrite and nitrate in the urine was measured with a colorimetric method in 137 children with a median age of 3 years, 84 patients and 53 reference children, all of whom underwent a small intestinal biopsy to confirm or overrule suspicion of celiac disease. RESULTS: Median urinary nitrite-nitrate concentration in celiac children was 3323 microM (4147 +/- 1102; mean +/- SEM) at first clinical examination and 2501 microM (2939 +/- 386) after gluten challenge, which was significantly higher than concentrations in reference children (1029 microM; 1174 +/- 116) and in children with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet (882 microM; 1369 +/- 360) (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A gluten-containing diet is associated with an increased nitrite-nitrate secretion in the urine in children with celiac disease, presumably as a result of nitric oxide synthase activation and nitric oxide production in the diseased small intestinal mucosa.},

Whether different doses and formulations of bacterial lipase and diets affect steatorrhea was tested in pancreatic-insufficient dogs. METHODS: A dose of 0-600,000 IU of powdered and 135,000 and 300,000 IU of liquid bacterial lipase was given with a standard meal to 5 dogs with ligated pancreatic ducts. In 4 dogs, 0 or 300,000 IU (normal 6-hour postprandial amount) of powder bacterial lipase was also given with five meals containing 850 kcal with different nutrient caloric densities (mixture design). Coefficients of fat absorption during 72-hour fecal balance studies were used to assess treatments. RESULTS: With the standard meal, powder bacterial lipase reduced steatorrhea in a dose-dependent manner (P = 0.03), and 135,000 and 300,000 IU of the liquid form decreased steatorrhea more than powder bacterial lipase (P = 0.017 and 0.057, respectively). Coefficients of fat absorption with 300,000 IU of powder bacterial lipase correlated (r2 = 0.79; P < 0.001) with increasing proportions of fat calories in diets. CONCLUSIONS: Liquid bacterial lipase decreases steatorrhea more than powder, and 300,000 IU of powder bacterial lipase ingested with high-fat meals corrects canine pancreatic steatorrhea. The combination of adequate mixing of small amounts (milligrams) of bacterial lipase and high-fat meals abolishes canine steatorrhea and may abolish human pancreatic steatorrhea.},

   abstract = {Osteoporosis is a complication of adult celiac disease. The gluten-free diet improves but does not normalize bone mineral density. Only few and conflicting data are known about the influence of the disease and diet on bone mineralization in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the radial bone mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD) in children and adolescents who are asymptomatic on gluten-free diet. The BMD and BMC values of non-dominant radius midshaft in ninety-one children (53 girls and 38 boys, mean age: 11.7 years, mean duration of disease: 8.7 years) were determined by single photon absorptiometry. At the diagnosis and at least three years after gluten-free diet, serum calcium, phosphorous and albumin concentrations and alkaline phosphatase activities were determined in all, and additionally intact parathormone concentrations in 16 patients. The mean BMC Z-score value in the entire study population did not differ from the value of normal age-matched population (mean Z-score: -0.27), but in female adolescent group was significantly lower than the normal value (mean Z-score: -1.04, p < 0.01). In contrast, the mean BMC Z-score value was significantly higher than in normal value in girls (mean Z-score: +1.36, p < 0.001), in boys (mean Z-score: +0.53, p < 0.02) as well as in the total patients group (mean Z-score: +1.01, p < 0.001). The diameter of radius midshaft was significantly smaller in all age group than the normal mean value. Serum laboratory parameters of asymptomatic patients were in the normal range. The serum parathormone value in treated patients was significantly lower than in untreated celiac children (mean +/- SD: 3.77 +/- 1.07 versus 7.89 +/- 2.54, p < 0.01), but significantly higher compared to controls (2.89 +/- 0.9, p < 0.05). The data indicate that the gluten-free diet alone is not able to normalize bone mineralization in children. The significant increase of serum parathormone level in treated asymptomatic patients may be explained by the lower calcium content of gluten-free diet. The authors suppose that low calcium supply in children similarly to adult patients can lead to increased parathormone secretion, which can cause the retardation of bone growth even in treated patients with celiac disease.},

We describe a female patient who presented with clinically and histologically typical EED in whom previously undiagnosed coeliac disease was found. Appearance of EED lesions was preceded by widespread joint pains. In extensive laboratory tests, the only abnormal findings were an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and decreased haemoglobin and folic acid levels. Later, IgA and IgG type antireticulin and antigliadin antibodies were detected. Serum total IgA was elevated but no paraproteinaemia was found. In lesional skin, granular deposits of IgA and C3 were seen at the dermo-epidermal junction. A duodenal biopsy revealed total villous atrophy. Dapsone treatment was partly effective but complete healing of the EED lesions was achieved only after the introduction of a strict gluten-free diet. The patient has now remained symptom-free on the diet for 1.5 years.},

   abstract = {Inflammation is characterized by increased nitric oxide production. Nitrotyrosine has recently been suggested to be useful as a marker for NO-mediated tissue damage. In context of the development of an ELISA for detection of nitrotyrosine in plasma, monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies were developed by injecting mice with nitrated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The specificity of the antibodies was determined by binding to nitrated BSA, lack of binding to unmodified BSA, tyrosine, 3-chlorotyrosine or phenylalanine and inhibition of binding by nitrotyrosine. The antibodies developed are useful for Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining. Using these antibodies a nitrotyrosine sandwich ELISA was developed with a lower detection limit of approximately 0.2 nM. The intra- and interassay variance were 2.4% and 11.9%, respectively. Using this newly developed ELISA, 1.27 +/- 1.03 microM nitrotyrosine was detected in plasma samples of celiac disease patients whereas nitrotyrosine was undetectable in control samples. Elevated nitrotyrosine levels were paralleled by an increase in plasma concentrations of NO-oxidation products (NOx), nitrite and nitrate from 15.1 +/- 6.1 microM in controls to 61.0 +/- 28.2 microM in celiac disease patients. Both nitrotyrosine and NOx levels declined when the patients were on a gluten-free diet, suggesting a relation between intestinal inflammation and plasma nitrotyrosine and NOx levels.},

To determine if a flat jejunal mucosa in celiac patients is related to a reduced cholecystokinin-secreting capacity, increasing doses of bombesin were infused into six patients with celiac disease and a flat jejunal mucosa (group A), in seven celiac patients with a normal jejunal mucosa while on a gluten-free diet (group B), and in seven healthy controls (group C). Bombesin induced significant (P < 0.05) increments of plasma CCK to a maximum value of 1.0 +/- 0.3 pM in group A, to 1.5 +/- 0.3 pM in group B, and to 1.2 +/- 0.3 pM in group C (NS between groups), that were accompanied by significant (P < 0.05) gallbladder emptying responses of 70 +/- 4% in group A, 47 +/- 10% in group B and 65 +/- 5% in group C. Dose-response relationships were not different between groups. We conclude that there is no major impairment of gallbladder responsiveness to bombesin or of cholecystokinin-secreting capacity in patients with a flat jejunal mucosa due to celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an intolerance to protein fractions in wheat, rye, barley, and possibly oats. When these grains are consumed by a person with celiac disease, they damage the mucosa of the small intestine, which eventually leads to malabsorption of nutrients. Patients are therefore advised to remove these grains from their diet, with lifelong adherence generally suggested. Although many dietitians and physicians consider this dietary prescription to be standard protocol, it is actually quite controversial. Whether oats can safely be consumed by persons with celiac disease has been debated since the gluten-free diet was first advocated more than 40 years ago. Historically, there have been several reasons for this debate, including the difficulty in identifying the precise amino acid sequence in gliadin that is responsible for toxicity; the differences in cereal chemistry between wheat and oats; and the lack of well-designed studies to assess the toxicity of oats. A growing body of evidence now suggests that moderate amounts of oats may be safely consumed by most adults with celiac disease. If further research continues to find no adverse effects from oat consumption, a consensus may emerge on the place of oats in the gluten-free diet. In the meantime, individual dietary prescriptions, routinely assessed for appropriateness using histologic and/or serologic studies, may be warranted to prevent unnecessary dietary restrictiveness and undesirable medical complications.},

   abstract = {One of the characteristic features of celiac disease is an increase in anti-gliadin antibodies (Abs). Recently we found that some of the monoclonal Abs to gliadin cross-react with molecules on rat enterocytes. One of these cross-reacting molecules was identified as rat calreticulin. This study shows that the levels of serum IgA Abs to gliadin, rat, and human enterocytes; purified enterocyte antigens; and calreticulin in sera from patients with active disease were significantly higher than in patients on a gluten-free diet and healthy controls (P < 0.001). Anti-gliadin Abs were isolated by affinity chromatography from the sera of six active celiac patients. The reactivity of these anti-gliadin Abs was demonstrated to be significantly higher (P < 0.05) with human enterocytes and human calreticulin than with other antigens tested. Furthermore, using isolated patients' anti-gliadin Abs bound to Sepharose 2B, two main proteins of molecular mass 62 and 66 kDa were purified from a lysate of human enterocytes. The 62-kDa enterocyte antigen was identified as human calreticulin. These findings suggest that anti-gliadin Abs may play a pathogenic role in celiac disease by cross-reacting with enterocytes. Calreticulin in enterocytes may be one of the putative targets for autoimmune reactions.},

The gold standard for the evaluation of fat malabsorption is the faecal fat balance method. The acid steatocrit method has recently been introduced as a simple method to evaluate faecal fat. The present study was aimed at evaluating the acid steatocrit in clinical practice. Faecal fat excretion and acid steatocrit results were determined in 42 children, half with and half without fat malabsorption. Acid steatocrit results correlated significantly with both faecal fat excretion (p < 0.01) and faecal fat concentration (p < 0.001). Sensitivity and specificity of the acid steatocrit for the diagnosis of malabsorption were 90% and 100%, respectively. We consider the acid steatocrit method useful for the screening and monitoring of patients with steatorrhoea.},

Investigations into first-degree relatives of coeliac disease patients have often shown that relatives exhibit intermediate features of coeliac disease, possibly due to a low gluten intake. AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of gluten consumption in the general Dutch population for different age and sex groups and for different product groups, and to investigate the daily gluten intake of first-degree relatives of coeliac disease patients. METHODS: Questionnaires concerning the gluten intake of 55 first-degree relatives of coeliac disease patients were analysed. To determine the gluten intake of the general Dutch population, the results of a mass investigation were used. The amount of gluten in the gluten-rich products was estimated by multiplying the amount of vegetable proteins by 0.8. RESULTS: The median daily gluten intake of the relatives was 12.9 g (range: 3.8-31.3). The mean daily gluten intake of the study population in the Netherlands was 1 3.1 g. CONCLUSION: The gluten intake of first-degree relatives of coeliac disease patients was the same as that of the general population. Thus, a low gluten intake apparently does not explain the aspecific presentation and prevalence of coeliac disease in first-degree relatives of coeliac disease patients.},

Hair diameter was significantly lower and cuticular erosion scores higher in those who were not on gluten-free diets as compared to controls, showing a tendency towards normal values following start of gluten-free diets. Proton-induced X-ray emission showed significantly lower zinc content of the hair shaft in the group with acute coeliac disease and after a short-term diet, which approached the normal range only after a year-long diet. The serum prolactin levels in healthy controls and in coeliac patients on the diet were within normal limits, whereas in children with coeliac disease taking gluten in their meals, a significant hyperprolactinaemia was found. The erythrocyte glutathione content of coeliac children was elevated, and the glutathione disulfide level was significantly decreased, as compared to values in normal controls. The erythrocyte glutathione disulfide level and glutathione disulfide/erythrocyte glutathione ratio in coeliac children also differed from those in children with iron deficiency. With genotyping, the DQB1*0201/2 (p < 0.00001) and DR3 (p < 0.00001), DR7 (p < 0.01) alleles showed significant positive association with the disease.},

The results were positive for antiendomysial antibodies and the jejunal biopsy confirmed the coexistence of celiac disease, which was asymptomatic until that moment. The gluten-free diet ameliorated the index of cholestasis. Case 2 was an old man suffering from undiagnosed celiac disease for at least 5 years prior to admission at our Department. The diagnosis was based on the histological examination of a jejunal biopsy. The patient did not follow the gluten-free diet and was again admitted to our Department 6 years later with symptoms of cholestasis. The liver biopsy and ERCP confirmed the diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis.},

In an attempt to clarify this association, the prevalence of celiac disease among diabetic children was determined, and the risk of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was defined in pediatric patients with celiac disease. METHODS: Ninety-three children with diabetes were analyzed for the presence of celiac disease-related markers (antigliadin and antiendomysial antibodies) and characteristic alterations in the intestinal mucosa. In another group, 93 children with celiac disease were screened for pancreatic autoantibodies and pancreatic beta-cell function. RESULTS: Among children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, a 6.45% prevalence of celiac disease was observed, a value significantly higher than that found among healthy controls. In contrast, only three celiac disease patients showed potential autoimmunity toward the pancreatic beta cell, a proportion not significantly different from that in the general population. Additionally, no alteration of glucose metabolism was observed in the antibody-positive patients. CONCLUSION: The increased risk of celiac disease among patients with diabetes requires a long follow-up to determine the presence of celiac disease markers among patients with diabetes, to avoid potential malignant disease derived from untreated celiac disease. In contrast, there is no evidence to support an increased risk of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus among children with celiac disease. In accordance with the accepted influence of diet in the development of autoimmune diabetes, a hypothetical mechanism of protection against insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus that is mediated by environmental factors related to restricted diet is suggested in this population.},

   abstract = {Increased gastrointestinal permeability was found in celiac disease already 20 years ago. Originally a genetical defect was supposed leading to elevated permeability and later to celiac disease. However, patients under long-term gluten-free diet normalized their permeability tests. On the other side, unaffected relatives of patients with celiac disease showed high permeability but not different from patients with irritable bowel syndrome and with a tendency for normalization during follow-up. In active symptomatic celiac disease, permeability is elevated in the gastroduodenum - measured by sucrose test - as well as in the small intestine - measured by lactulose/mannitol ratio. The sensitivity in active celiac disease is high (near 100%), the specificity is low due to high permeability in many intestinal diseases as in acute infectious gastroenteritis, Crohn's disease, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment, etc. In contrast, lactulose/mannitol test permeability is much less sensitive in silent celiac disease without diarrhea (74%). The real importance of permeability disease is established by its use for follow-up of celiac patients under gluten-free diet whereas it is correlated to the degree of mucosal atrophy. In vitro tests also show increased lactulose mucosal to serosal flux in celiac disease, but not correlated to oral permeability test. In conclusion, lactulose/mannitol test is the only noninvasive functional test in celiac disease which has essential importance in active celiac disease and in follow-up under diet.},

Raised concentrations of transaminases, or aminotransferases, have been retrospectively observed in about a half of patients with coeliac disease who are on a gluten-containing diet. We aimed to establish the overall prevalence of coeliac disease among patients with cryptogenic hypertransaminasaemia. METHODS: Of the 600 consecutive patients referred to our outpatient clinic for liver disease due to raised serum transaminases from September, 1995, to June, 1997, 55 were classified as having cryptogenic hypertransaminasaemia after the exclusion of every known cause of liver disease. These patients were tested by indirect immunofluorescence for IgA to endomysium and for IgA and IgG to gliadin. FINDINGS: Five patients were positive for both IgA to endomysium and IgG to gliadin, whereas IgA to gliadin was only found in four patients. IgG to gliadin was also present in another patient who was not positive for antibodies to endomysium. The six antibody-positive patients had duodenal biopsy that showed a subtotal villous atrophy consistent with coeliac disease in the five patients with antibodies to endomysium. The patient with only IgG to gliadin had a normal small-intestine mucosa. None of the five patients with coeliac disease had gastrointestinal symptoms. Liver biopsy samples were taken from three of the five patients with flat mucosa and showed a histological picture of nonspecific reactive hepatitis. Transaminase concentrations reverted to normal within 6 months in four patients with coeliac disease who followed a strict gluten-free diet. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that about 9% of patients with cryptogenic hypertransaminasaemia are affected by symptom-free coeliac disease. Gluten-sensitive enteropathy and antibody screening for coeliac disease by means of antibodies to endomysium and gliadin should be considered in these patients.},

Initially, latent celiac disease was suggested because of normal endoscopic findings, the finding of non-specific inflammation on histological evaluation of duodenal biopsies, positive IgA and IgG gliadin, as well as endomysium antibodies and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. There was no response to a gluten-free diet. A reevaluation revealed Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is characterized by autodestruction of enterocytes after exposure of genetically susceptible individuals to dietary gluten. To define the transport pathways of proteins involved in the celiac immune response, we wished to determine the subcellular compartments of the intestinal mucosa where wheat gliadin peptides colocalize with receptors of T lymphocytes, including alpha/beta-TCR, gamma/delta-TCR, and CD8. Semithin and ultrathin frozen section of jejunal biopsies from CD patients and controls were used to perform immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling as well as in situ hybridization experiments. In patients with active CD, we detected gliadin peptides in vacuoles and Golgi complexes of enterocytes. CD8, alpha/beta-TCR, and gamma/delta-TCR were found in vacuoles and Golgi complexes within these gliadin-containing enterocytes in addition to the surface of intraepithelial and mucosal T lymphocytes. In contrast, we observed that the localization of CD4, CD3, T cell-restricted intracellular antigen (TIA), and leukocyte common antigen (LCA) was restricted to lymphocytes in CD patients. We further detected labeling signals for gliadin peptides, CD8, alpha/beta-TCR, and gamma/delta-TCR at the basal membrane of enterocytes that were interdigitated by extensions of lymphocytes. In situ hybridization experiments revealed that CD8 and gamma/delta-TCR were not expressed by CD enterocytes. We conclude that CD8, alpha/beta-TCR, and gamma/delta-TCR are targeted to Golgi complexes and vacuoles of small intestinal enterocytes in active CD. The observed process may be involved in the pathogenesis of CD enterocytes. We propose a mechanism for the uptake of CD8, alpha/beta-TCR, and gamma/delta-TCR by the basolateral membrane of small intestinal enterocytes.},
