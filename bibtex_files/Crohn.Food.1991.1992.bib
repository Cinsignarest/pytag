The patient felt throughout the period of parenteral nutrition very well, he worked and the secretion from the fistula stopped after four weeks. After 15 months of complete parenteral nutrition and elimination of oral food intake a marked improvement of the local finding in the rectum was observed. All laboratory findings (haemogram, liver tests, urea, creatinine, transferrin, albumin, cholinesterase and pre-albumin, serum levels of sodium, potassium, chlorides, calcium and phosphates) were throughout the observation period within a normal range. The body weight of the patient increased during the 15 months by 1 kg. The described case is the first one where domiciliary parenteral nutrition was used in Czechoslovakia under ambulatory conditions.},

The patients' mean Pettit Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) while taking baker's yeast (mean, 107.9; SE, 6.1) was significantly greater than during yeast exclusion (mean, 102.1; SE, 5.7; p less than 0.05). The mean of each patient's maximum CDAI during yeast exclusion (mean, 107.1; SE, 5.7) was significantly lower than those during the base-line (mean, 115.2; SE, 6.1; p less than 0.05) and baker's yeast inclusion periods (mean, 113.9; SE, 6.7; p less than 0.05). Patients with elevated yeast antibodies tended to develop a higher CDAI while receiving baker's yeast (13 of 15).

Nine patients [serum creatinine (s-Cr) less than 2 mg/dl; 24-hour proteinuria higher than 1.5 g, but not nephrotic) were treated with 5-ASA (2.4 g/day for 6 months); 9 similar patients were treated with SCG (400 mg/day for 6 months); the follow-up extended to 6 months after stopping therapy. The 5-ASA group showed a slight but not significant decrease in s-Cr, 24-hour/proteinuria, IgA circulating immune complexes (IgA-CIC) and IgA rheumatoid factor (IgA-RF); serum beta 2-microglobulin and serum IgA were unchanged; 2 of 9 treated patients showed, after 6 months of therapy, a reduction in proteinuria of more than 50% that lasted for the subsequent 18 months. The SCG-treated group showed a slight but not significant increase in 24-hour proteinuria and a significant decrease in serum IgA; unchanged were s-Cr, IgA-CIC, IgA-RF, serum beta 2-microglobulin; no patient treated with SCG showed a reduction in proteinuria of more than 50%. At the dosages and for the periods used, 5-ASA and SCG did not show a significant influence on clinical and laboratory parameters of disease in IgAN; other trials with increased dosages are warranted to definitely ascertain the possible therapeutic role of these drugs in IgAN.},

   abstract = {Growth failure is frequently associated with Crohn's disease. However, it does not seem to be fully accounted for by overt endocrinological abnormalities or nutrient deficiencies. It may be related to an abnormal utilization of available substrates, particularly proteins, due to an imbalance in protein metabolism kinetics. Its primary mechanism may be an increase in protein breakdown rates over synthesis, specifically related to the associated inflammatory syndrome, and progressively leading to a protein debt. Reduction in food intake would only exaggerate this trend by further reducing the synthesis to breakdown ratio, whereas nutrient supplementation merely compensates for the deficit by promoting protein synthesis.},

A survey of dietary oil usage was conducted among Asians in Leicester, comparing inflammatory bowel disease patients with healthy controls. Two groups were comparable for age, sex, religion, place of birth, number of years spent in Britain and vegetarian status. There were no significant differences in actual oils used between healthy controls and patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease (chi 2 = 0.142 and 1.803 respectively, p greater than 0.50). However patients with Crohn's disease were found to recycle their cooking oil significantly more often than age and sex-matched colitics (p less than 0.05) and particularly age and sex-matched controls (p less than 0.01). A similar study needs to be conducted in India where the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease is low. If this difference is confirmed a programme of health education in cooking habits could lower the incidence of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease encompasses both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, two conditions so alike clinically that they are frequently indistinguishable from one another. Inflammatory bowel disease occurs at a rate of approximately five per 100,000 people. It tends to cluster in families and is seen four to five times more often in Jewish Caucasians than in other Caucasians. The etiology is unknown. Increasing attention is being paid to autoimmune factors, genetic factors and food allergies, and the notion that inflammatory bowel disease has its roots in a psychological disorder continues to pale for want of empirically sound evidence. Disease pattern is one of remission and exacerbation. The aim of therapy is to maintain an optimal lifestyle in remission through an individually tailored protocol of medications. Sulfasalazine remains the medication of choice; corticosteroids have short-term utility in exacerbation; and immunosuppressants, though controversial, are thought to have some steroid-sparing benefits during acute flare-ups. Indications for surgery vary, depending on whether or not a clear differential diagnosis has been made between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. There is no cure for inflammatory bowel disease except for total colectomy in clearly diagnosed ulcerative colitis. Current research endeavors seek a cause or causes for inflammatory bowel disease, but the literature does not solidly support any one possibility above other rival etiologies.},

Infants in developed settings experience twice the hospitalization rate and more severe illness from lower respiratory tract infection, primarily respiratory syncytial virus. In developing countries the mortality risk is 4-fold. for otitis media, the relative risks were 3.3-4.3 for Finnish infants. Bacterial meningitis and/or bacteremia had a 4-fold risk for hospitalization in a Connecticut study, and a 3-fold relative risk in 2 developing country studies. Human milk was the best preventative for bacteremia and necrotizing enterocolitis in prematures in British neonatal units. A 20-fold reduction in neonatal deaths occurred in Philippine study of breastfeeding, especially in low birth weight babies. Diarrhea causes the most infant mortality in developing nations, where bottle-feeding raises rates 14-fold. In the U.S. estimated relative risks is 3.7 for diarrheal mortality. Sudden infant death is about 1/5 less common in U.S. breast fed babies than in bottle fed. There is evidence for better long-term health after breast feeding in disorders such as celiac disease, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, malignant lymphoma, chronic liver disease, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies. The design of good studies of protection conferred by breast feeding, and the possible modes of action of breast milk are discussed.

   abstract = {Intrinsic factor is produced by the gastric parietal cell. Its secretion is stimulated via all pathways known to stimulate gastric acid secretion: histamine, gastrin, and acetylcholine. There is, however, a different mode of secretion for both substances: atropine, vagotomy, and H2 receptor antagonists inhibit both intrinsic factor and acid secretion, but secretin and the hydrogen-potassium ATPase antagonist omeprazole have no effect on intrinsic factor while substantially reducing acid secretion. Cobalamin in food is bound to animal protein. Cobalamin deficiency due to inadequate dietary intake is rarely seen in extreme vegetarians (vegans). In the stomach cobalamin is liberated from its protein binding by peptic digestion and bound to R-proteins. Hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria, whether medically induced or not, may impair cobalamin uptake. The cobalamin-R-protein complex is split by pancreatic enzymes in the duodenum, where cobalamin is bound to intrinsic factor. Pancreatic insufficiency may lead to cobalamin deficiency. Lack of intrinsic factor is the commonest cause of cobalamin deficiency; very rarely, aberrant forms of intrinsic factor are produced, but the clinical syndrome is similar. Gram-negative anaerobe bacteria bind the cobalamin-intrinsic factor complex, and bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine diminishes cobalamin resorption. Parasitic infections with fish tape-worm and Giardia lamblia are also associated with cobalamin malabsorption. The cobalamin-intrinsic factor complex binds to the ileal receptors in the terminal ileum. Cobalamin absorption may be impaired after resection or by diseases affecting more than 50 cm of the terminal ileum, such as Crohn's disease, coeliac disease, tuberculosis, lymphoma or radiation. There is clearly a wide diversity in the aetiology of cobalamin deficiency, which requires a versatile diagnostic approach.},

Clinical acceptance of food sensitivity has been delayed by the use of dubious diagnostic techniques by a minority of practitioners and the lack of laboratory diagnostic tests, but several double blind studies have now fully validated the existence of food sensitivity syndromes. More widespread recognition of food sensitivity would be cost effective for the National Health Service.},

Twenty-seven patients with established Crohn's disease who attained clinical remission after four weeks of enteral feeding were followed prospectively for up to 36 months. Twenty of these were willing to be tested for specific food intolerance using a pre-defined dietary elimination protocol; the others continued on a normal unrestricted diet. Eighteen patients (67%) have since relapsed; 89% of the relapse occurred within the first 6 months. Of the 15 patients with colonic involvement, 12 (80%) relapsed by 6 months. In contrast only 3 of 11 with isolated small bowel disease experienced early relapse. Of the 14 patients who completed the process of dietary testing, 5 could not identify any trigger foods; the remaining 9 were maintained on exclusion diets, 3 of whom relapsed early. Of the 11 taking a normal diet, 9 relapsed. Disease duration, previous intestinal resection or prior steroid therapy did not affect the relapse rate. Eight patients (31%) obtained a long-term remission, mean 23 months (range 12-36 months), without any medication. Long-lasting remissions can be obtained in about one-third of patients with Crohn's disease following treatment with a defined formula diet. Colonic involvement is associated with a high early relapse rate.},

Plasma zinc remained stable when volunteers fasted all day, but self-selected meals and 600 kCal of dextrose or fat emulsion caused significantly reduced plasma zinc concentrations [mean (SD) 12.1 (1.4), 12.3 (0.6) and 12.2 (0.7) mumol/L at 1400 h, respectively, compared with a fasting level of 13.9 (1.6) mumol/L at 0800 h, P less than 0.05]. In patients undergoing intravenous hyperalimentation, plasma zinc decreased from 12.0 (1.4) mumol/L at 0800 h to 10.0 (1.1) mumol/L at 1400 h [mean (SD), P less than 0.01]. These data show that both enteral and i.v. feeding cause a decline in plasma zinc and that glucose alone is not responsible for this post-prandial fall since ingestion of isocaloric amounts of glucose or fat have a similar effect.},

   abstract = {Malnutrition is a frequent occurrence in patients with acute inflammatory bowel disease. Total nutritional support provided either parentally (TPN) or enterally (TEN) has been advocated not only as an adjunct for improving nutrition but also as primary therapy. For patients with acute Crohn's disease, short-term rates of remission after TEN are equivalent to TPN. Coupled with certain advantages when compared with TPN, including simpler administration, fewer side effects, and preservation of the intestinal mucosal barrier, TEN may therefore be the preferred route for nutrient delivery. Controlled trials indicate equivalent or superior efficacy when enteral polymeric diets are compared with elemental diets for inducing remission in acute Crohn's disease. Moreover, when provided as an elemental diet, TEN is as effective as corticosteroids for achieving remission in acute Crohn's disease, but corticosteroids appear to be more effective than polymeric diets. Although the provision of nutritional support rather than bowel rest is the major factor contributing to symptomatic improvement, the optimal nutrient composition and the precise mechanisms whereby nutritional support achieves clinical remission remain to be clarified. In contrast to Crohn's disease, nutritional support is not effective for achieving remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. Thus, enteral nutritional support is an effective therapy for the short-term management of acute Crohn's disease. Whether long-term remission is equivalent to treatment with drugs or surgery requires prospective evaluation. Future avenues of investigation also include defining the optimal nutrient composition and the underlying mechanisms that achieve maximal nutritional repletion, promote mucosal cell renewal, and potentially directly retard production of inflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {The incorporation of the fatty acids in fish and olive oil into the colonic mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease was examined during 12 weeks' dietary supplementation with the oils, and the influence on colonic mucosal prostaglandin and thromboxane generation was measured. With a dietary supplement of 18 g fish oil daily, concentrations of the major polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oil, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, were significantly raised in mucosal lipids. The first time these were measured, after three weeks' supplementation, the mean increases in eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid were seven fold and 1.5 fold respectively, and these increases were maintained during the 12 week study. Arachidonic acid values fell throughout the study and this reduction was significant at 12 weeks. Mucosal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxane B2, and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha synthesis were suppressed, and this reached significance (p less than 0.05) at three and 12 weeks for PGE2 and at 12 weeks for thromboxane B2. The predominant fatty acid in olive oil is oleic acid. Supplementation with 18 g/day resulted in a significant increase in oleic acid in colonic mucosa at 12 weeks (p less than 0.05) and a fall in stearic acid and docosahexaenoic acid; there was no significant change in eicosanoid synthesis. It is concluded that colonic lipids and prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis can be readily altered by dietary supplementation with fish oil. The extent of incorporation of the fatty acids present in oils is dependent upon the individual fatty acid.},

The twins were made up of five pairs concordant and nine pairs discordant for Crohn's disease, and two pairs concordant and 10 pairs discordant for ulcerative colitis. Two patients with Crohn's disease had a slight increase in disease activity, the others were in clinical remission. Two striking observations were made: first, individuals with ulcerative colitis were indistinguishable from healthy twins, and controls except for the response to gliadin. Both healthy and diseased twins had higher IgA levels to gliadin than controls. Second, twins who had developed Crohn's disease displayed higher antibody titres towards yeast cell wall mannan in particular, but also to whole yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) of all antibody types (IgA, IgG, and IgM). In contrast, the response to gliadin, ovalbumin, and betalactoglobulin did not differ from healthy twins and was even lower than in the controls. The results argue against an increased systemic antigen presentation caused by an impaired mucosal barrier in the inflammatory bowel disease. Rather, they suggest that yeast cell wall material--that is, mannan, or some antigen rich in mannose and cross reacting with mannan, may play an aetiological role in Crohn's disease, but not in ulcerative colitis. The increases in IgA and IgM, as well as IgG suggest that local and systemic immune systems are selectively activated by antigen(s) present in the cell wall of baker's yeast.},

   abstract = {Although defined formula diets may be useful for initial episodes of Crohn's disease, the effects of these diets on subsequent attacks of Crohn's disease or in conjunction with corticosteroids are unknown. To evaluate these issues, we studied 27 patients in a randomized prospective trial. Ten patients received only prednisone (group I), nine received only a defined formula diet (Vital HN [high nitrogen]) (group II), and eight received a combination of prednisone and Vital HN (group III). At the time of entry into the study, the groups were similar with respect to age, sex, Crohn's Disease Activity Index, previous and current treatments, anatomic site of disease, and nutritional status. After 1 month of treatment, we noted seven successes (70%) and three failures in group I (prednisone only), three successes (33%) and six failures in group II (Vital HN only), and six successes (75%) and two failures in group III (combination therapy). Four patients randomized to receive only Vital HN were unable or unwilling to tolerate the defined formula diet. Of the five patients who were able to take the defined formula diet for 1 month, however, three (60%) were successfully treated. The patients who received prednisone (groups I and III) responded better than did the patients who received only the defined formula diet. These results may be attributable to the use of a nonelemental diet or the treatment of patients who were not experiencing an initial attack of Crohn's disease or who had previously received corticosteroids. The expensive and often poorly tolerated defined formula diets should not be considered as a substitute for standard therapy with corticosteroids in Crohn's disease.},

Patients with active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index greater than 200) were randomized to receive either enteral nutrition with a liquid oligopeptide diet (n = 55) or a combination of 6-methylprednisolone, 48 mg daily, subsequently tapered, and sulfasalazine, 3 g daily (n = 52). The two groups were not different with respect to age, sex, body weight, location of disease, or treatment before the study. The severity of disease was similar at the beginning of the study in both groups [Crohn's Disease Activity Index (mean +/- SEM), 323 +/- 12 vs. 316 +/- 11]. Remission was defined as a decrease of the initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index by 40% or at least 100 points. Twenty-nine patients in the diet group and 41 patients in the drug group reached remission within 6 weeks of therapy (chi 2 test, P less than 0.01). The median elapsed time to remission was 30.7 days in the diet group compared with 8.2 days in the drug group (Mantel Cox, P less than 0.01). To determine whether one of these treatments was more beneficial for a subgroup of patients, the effectiveness of both treatments was analyzed separately in patients with very severe disease (initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index greater than 300) and less severe disease (initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index less than 300), and in patients with different disease location. However, no influence of initial disease activity or disease location on the effect of either treatment could be shown. These data show that enteral nutrition is less effective than a combination of 6-methylprednisolone and sulfasalazine in treating active Crohn's disease.},

This is in part due to reduced terminal ileal bile salt absorption and consequent increased cholesterol saturation in bile. The aim of this study was to evaluate gallbladder contractility, a second important factor in the pathogenesis of gallstones, in Crohn's disease. 2. Thirty patients with Crohn's disease and no known biliary tract disease and nine healthy control subjects were studied. After an overnight fast, gallbladder volume was determined by real-time ultrasonography before and 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min after ingestion of a standard liquid fatty meal. 3. Compared with healthy control subjects, patients with Crohn's disease had similar fasting gallbladder volumes (control, 18.7 +/- 2.3 ml; Crohn's disease, 18.2 +/- 2.3 ml). Percentage emptying was significantly impaired at 30, 40 and 50 min in patients with Crohn's disease compared with control subjects. Patients with Crohn's disease limited to the small bowel had gallbladder contractility that was comparable with that of control subjects, whereas in those with large-bowel disease, minimum residual gallbladder volume was significantly smaller than in control subjects. Patients with both large- and small-bowel Crohn's disease demonstrated the most marked abnormalities, with gallbladder volumes significantly larger than those of control subjects at 30, 40 and 50 min. Likewise, patients with Crohn's disease who had undergone previous bowel resection had impaired emptying at 30, 40 and 50 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Regarding the unknown pathogenesis of Crohn's disease repeatedly the importance of diet has been accentuated. Epidemiological, biochemical and animal experimental results have focused on a possible relationship between the consumption of chemically processed, partial hydrogenated fats and the development of regional enteritis. In this context an experimental animal model in pigs was designed to analyze, whether transmission electron microscopic alterations of ileal mucosa could be induced by forage of chemically processed fats. By creation of a retroperistaltic ileal segment the contact time between chyme and intestinal mucosa was prolonged. Our underlying question was to what extent disorders of the intestinal barrier function could be compared to Crohn's disease. Present study concentrates on the epithelial-cell-layer. It was shown that in comparison to the control animals the lamina epithelialis mucosae of all animals after fat-feeding was characterized by: sublethal lesion of the enterocytes/crypt-epithelial cells (shortening and alteration of the microvilli, degeneration of mitochondria, formation of autophagocytic vacuoles); goblet cell hyperplasia and increased production of mucus; focal appearance of intraepithelial lymphocytes as well as presence of polymorphonuclear granulocytes in the epithelium; widening of the intercellular-space locally up to total loss of the functional structure of the epithelial-cell-layer. In total the picture can be evaluated as an inflammatory process of the ileal mucosa. It can be concluded, that chemically processed fats as used in the described experimental conditions could induce this process. The feature of mucosal damage shows obvious similarities to ultrastructural findings in Crohn's disease if compared.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease plays an important role in children's pathology. There is an increase in its incidence last decades. The etiology of Crohn's disease isn't yet known. The aim of therapy is to induce remission of the symptoms and disease's activity. Drug treatment as well as surgical procedures according to the side-effects and short-lasting effect have not shown to be satisfactory so far. Very important feature of Crohn's disease is growth retardation as well as puberty delay what is even emphasized by corticosteroid therapy which these children are quite long on. Recent research has shown that an elemental diet is as effective as corticosteroid therapy in inducing remission. Its positive effect on growth has been especially emphasized. It is not still certain how the elemental diet acts. It is supposed that its useful effects are achieved by its complete absorption without the need for extra digestion, by bowel rest, hypoallergenicity, changing in intestinal microflora, by caloric intake and reducing protein exudation by a direct influence on the mucosa of the small intestine. Because of all previously mentioned the elemental diet is recommended as a treatment of choice, especially for the nonstenositing features of Crohn's disease of the small intestine.},

Of the six patients failing to respond to elemental diet, four with steroid-refractory disease required early resective surgery for symptom relief, and two continued with steroid therapy, one in much reduced dosage. Elemental diet can bring about a sustained remission in many patients with Crohn's disease dependent on or refractory to corticosteroids, and reduce the need for surgical intervention.},

We obtained retrospective information about food intake 5 years previously by a postal questionnaire for 152 cases with Crohn's disease, 145 cases with ulcerative colitis, and 305 controls. The relative risk of Crohn's disease was increased for subjects who had a high (55 gm or more per day) intake of sucrose (relative risk = 2.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.4-5.0) and was decreased for subjects who had a high (15 gm or more per day) intake of fiber (relative risk = 0.5, 95% confidence interval = 0.3-0.9). The most striking finding was an increased relative risk of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis associated with consumption of fast foods: the relative risk associated with consumption of fast foods at least two times a week was estimated at 3.4 (95% confidence interval = 1.3-9.3) for Crohn's disease and 3.9 (95% confidence interval = 1.4-10.6) for ulcerative colitis. Although coffee seemed to provide a protective effect for both diseases, there are reasons to consider this finding an artifact.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease involves a great risk of malnutrition. Malabsorption, bacterial contamination, frequent abdominal surgery, meal-related pain, protein loss through the damaged mucosa contribute to creating nutritional problems. Malnutrition can worsen the outcome, both in medical and surgical patients, and deteriorate an often already altered immune response. Weight loss, low levels of blood protein, electrolytes, micronutrients and vitamins are usually related to the extension of the mucosal damage. Nutritional assessment can be difficult due to oedema and bleeding, who interfere with both clinical and laboratory evaluation. The exact amount of nitrogen, lipids, minerals stool loss can be useful. It is widely accepted the use of nutritional support in Crohn's disease, but many Authors do not agree concerning the route (enteral or parenteral) and the kind of nutrient to be used. Still controversial is the role of nutrition: just support or real therapy? Most recent hypothesis concerning the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease indicate food and/or bacterial antigens as involved in determining the pathology. The "bowel rest", considered for many years as a fasting period necessarily supported by parenteral nutrition, can also be obtained by the temporarily reduction or stop in presenting those antigens to the bowel mucosa. This new concept can be achieved not only by parenteral nutrition, but with an enteral elemental diet as well. The elemental diet contains all nutrients in the simplest way and thus succeeds in lowering or eliminating the antigenic power. The reported results seem to indicate an equivalence of enteral and parenteral nutrition; anyway enteral is advisable when feasible, being more physiological and less expensive and involving a lower risk of serious complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Previous studies have shown malnutrition to be the most likely cause of the decrease in height and weight velocities in these children. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an intermittent defined formula diet on growth and disease activity in children with Crohn's disease and growth failure. Six Tanner stage I-II patients, mean age 13.6 years with height less than the 5th percentile or height velocity less than the 3rd percentile were enrolled in a 1-year prospective study. An isotonic, hydrolyzed whey, medium-chain triglyceride formula was given by nocturnal nasogastric infusion at a caloric equivalent of 50th percentile for age, as the exclusive nutrient source 1 out of 4 months during a 1-year period. A 2-week exclusion diet and a 2-week low-residue diet followed the defined formula diet before resuming the regular diet for 2 months. Patients served as their individual control based on observations of at least 1 year before the study. Height and weight velocity significantly increased. Prednisone intake significantly decreased, and significant improvement was seen in disease activity, albumin, and somatomedin C. The results indicate that an intermittent defined formula diet can improve growth failure and significantly decrease disease activity in children with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {A controlled trial was performed to compare enteral feeding with either an amino acid based feed or a whole protein feed as sole treatment for active Crohn's disease. Twenty four patients were studied (nine with ileal, 11 with ileocolonic, and four with colonic disease). Both feeds proved effective; nine of 13 patients randomised to receive the amino acid based feed were in clinical remission within three weeks as defined by a simple activity index compared with eight of 11 treated with the whole protein feed. Patients in clinical remission were then crossed over onto the other feed. None of the six patients who were changed to the whole protein feed relapsed over the subsequent three week period compared with three of seven patients who were changed to the amino acid based feed. In responders the median serum C reactive protein concentration fell from 21 mg/l (range 9-82) on entry to 6 mg/l (range 3-19) at six weeks. Seven patients relapsed within eight months of starting solid food (mean 3.7 months), while nine were still in remission (follow up period 3-9 months, median six months). Detailed studies of staged reintroduction of food and permitted food additives were carried out over a four year period in a patient with extensive stricturing small bowel Crohn's disease who had been brought into remission by open treatment with enteral feeding. Carrageenan, other permitted emulsifiers, bread, meat, potatoes, oranges, refined sugar, dairy produce, flour, and rice were all reintroduced without any objective ill effect, but green vegetables provoked a clinical and biochemical relapse within one week of introduction. Remission was rapidly achieved by switching back to the enteral feed but reintroduction of the low residue diet that had been previously tolerated produced a brisk relapse. Clinical and biochemical remission was again achieved by a return to the enteral feed but relapse again occurred with reintroduction of the low residue diet. These studies confirm the therapeutic effect of enteral feeding in Crohn's disease. This effect does not seem to be due to avoidance of whole protein, but the very low residue of chemically defined enteral feeds may be important, particularly in patients with intestinal strictures.},

There was evidence that some patients suffering from Crohn's Disease, together with some having coeliac disease and ulcerative colitis, did have varying amounts of aflatoxins in their serum and urine. The presence of aflatoxins may have been due to exposure to food containing these toxins or inability of the patient to excrete aflatoxins on account of some gastro-intestinal derangement.

   abstract = {It is clear that the nutritional state of patients with inflammatory bowel disease is often impaired and can be improved by the provision of nutritional support. Improvement in nutritional status can be achieved as effectively with enteral as with parenteral nutrition. Nutritional support appears to have no primary therapeutic effect in patients with ulcerative colitis. With regard to nutritional support in Crohn's disease, parenteral nutrition should be restricted to use as supportive rather than primary therapy. Available information now seems to suggest that most of the benefits of parenteral nutrition in Crohn's disease are related to an improvement in nutritional state rather than as primary therapy, and its use should be restricted to the treatment of specific complications of Crohn's disease, such as intestinal obstruction related to stricture formation or short bowel syndrome following repeated resection. Although some doubt exists over the efficacy of oligopeptide-containing elemental and polymeric enteral diets, the present evidence indicates that chemically defined free amino acid-containing elemental diets have primary therapeutic efficacy in the management of acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease. As such, these diets are worthy of therapeutic trial in patients with severe Crohn's disease involving the distal colon and rectum, particularly in those patients who are malnourished and who prove to be resistant to treatment with a combination of topical corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid-containing compounds. Clinicians should be aware, though, that the beneficial effects are likely to be restricted to the short term, with high relapse rates by 1 year, this being particularly so in patients with distal Crohn's proctocolitis (Teahon et al, 1988). Volatile fatty acid enemas clearly have potential in the management of patients with severe steroid-resistant proctitis. Finally, one of the most important observations made in recent years is the one concerning the large losses of nitrogen that will occur in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with corticosteroids in the absence of adequate protein intake (O'Keefe et al, 1989). Hopefully the days of treating patients with severe inflammatory bowel disease with high dose corticosteroids and a peripheral dextrose or dextrose-saline drip have passed into history.},

Of these 46 patients, 19.6% had overt intra-abdominal sepsis, 30.4% had prior surgery, and 95.7% were taking corticosteroid drugs just before their operation. The mean (+/- SE) age was 31.5 +/- 2.0 years. The serum albumin level was less than 35 g/L in 93.5% of patients; all had a hematocrit value less than 0.36, and 80.4% lost more than 15% of their normal body weight. No patient received parenteral nutrition either preoperatively or postoperatively. No change in the preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative approach to treating patients with predominantly ileal Crohn's disease occurred during the 10-year period of review. There was a 2.2% incidence of perioperative complications (one superficial wound infection) and a 6.5% incidence of late (>1.49 months) complications (two suture sinuses and one wound abscess unassociated with a fistula). Our findings suggest that preoperative parenteral nutrition is unnecessary in the majority of patients with predominantly ileal Crohn's disease specifically undergoing right-sided ileocolectomy and primary ileocolic anastomosis.},

All went into a clinical remission within a few days of starting treatment. Treatment periods varied from two to four weeks, and were followed by elemental diet as a supplement to normal food in two patients. At term, all delivered a healthy infant. These patients indicate that elemental diet is a safe form of treatment for Crohn's disease during pregnancy and may be considered as an alternative to conventional drug treatments which carry a theoretical risk of teratogenesis.},

   abstract = {This study examines whether treatment of acute Crohn's disease with an elemental diet improves intestinal integrity and inflammation as assessed by a 51Cr-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetatic acid (EDTA) permeability test and the fecal excretion of 111In-labeled autologous leukocytes, respectively. Thirty-four patients with active Crohn's disease completed a 4-week treatment course with an elemental diet. Active disease was characterized by increased intestinal permeability [24-hour urine excretion of orally administered 51Cr-EDTA, 6.4% +/- 0.6% (mean +/- SE); normal, less than 3.0%] and by high fecal excretion of 111In-labeled leukocytes (14.2% +/- 1.1%; normal, less than 1.0%). Twenty-seven (80%) went into clinical remission, usually within a week of starting treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment, there was a significant decrease in both the urine excretion of 51Cr-EDTA (to 3.4% +/- 0.5%; P less than 0.01) and the fecal excretion of 111In (to 5.7% +/- 1.0%; P less than 0.001), indicating that such treatment is not just symptomatic. A framework for the mechanism by which elemental diet works, centering around the importance of the integrity of the intestinal barrier function, is proposed, and also appears to provide a logical explanation for some relapses of the disease.},

Mean rates of protein synthesis and breakdown markedly decreased after treatment with steroids (four) or an elemental diet (six). This suggests that protein synthesis and breakdown are increased during active Crohn's disease in children and are reduced after induction of remission regardless of the type of treatment.},

   abstract = {The role of the physiologic barrier function of the small bowel and its possible role in health and disease has attracted much attention over the past decade. The intestinal mucosal barrier for luminal macromolecules and microorganism is the result of non-immunologic and immunologic defense mechanisms. The non-immunologic mechanisms consist of intraluminal factors such as gastric acid, proteolytic activity, and motility and of mucosal surface factors like mucin and the microvillous membrane. The immunologic mechanisms include secretary IgA and cell-mediated immunity. Both types of mechanism are not completely mature at birth. Maturation of this barrier is not finished before the 2nd year of life. One of the aspects of the mucosal barrier function can be estimated by the intestinal permeability (IP) for macromolecules. We use the differential sugar absorption test (SAT), in which the ratio of urinary excretion of a relatively large molecule, lactulose, is compared with that of a relatively small molecule, mannitol, after oral ingestion. Although the small intestine is permeable to certain macromolecules in normal developmental conditions, an increased IP could be involved in the pathophysiology of several diseases, including infectious diarrhea, food allergy, celiac disease, and Crohn's disease. It can be concluded that IP, as measured with the SAT, reflects the state of the mucosal barrier and is altered in several gastrointestinal diseases. The SAT is a non-invasive IP test that can be of diagnostic help to demonstrate alterations in the small-mucosal barrier function and may be useful to evaluate therapeutic interventions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Olsalazine (sodium azodisalicylate; azodisal sodium) is an anti-inflammatory agent designed to deliver its active moiety, mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid; mesalamine), to the colon while avoiding the adverse effects associated with the use of a sulfapyridine carrier. As a prodrug, olsalazine is an effective oral treatment for both active ulcerative colitis and for maintenance of disease remission and may possibly be of benefit in patients with Crohn's colitis. Findings from both short and long term noncomparative and comparative studies demonstrate that olsalazine 1 to 3g daily in divided doses improves clinical signs and symptoms of colitis in approximately 60 to 80% of patients with acute ulcerative colitis of mild to moderate severity. This improvement rate was similar to that obtained with sulfasalazine. Lower doses of olsalazine, usually 1g daily in divided doses, also maintained remission in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis. While olsalazine effectively delivers mesalazine to the colon, the prodrug itself increases net luminal water secretion and accelerates gastrointestinal transit of a meal. The resulting diarrhoea (occurring in approximately 17% of patients and resulting in withdrawal from therapy in 6% of patients) is distinguishable from that associated with inflammatory bowel disease by the high water content and the absence of blood. Olsalazine-induced diarrhoea usually occurred soon after initiation of olsalazine therapy or dosage increase, was more frequent with higher doses and was usually transient. Dosage reduction, increases in frequency of dosing and concomitant administration with food reduced the severity in many patients with persistent olsalazine-induced diarrhoea. With the exception of diarrhoea, olsalazine was generally well tolerated. Fewer than 14% of patients allergic to or intolerant of sulfasalazine had similar reactions to olsalazine. Olsalazine appears to be a suitable therapy for the treatment of first attacks as well as acute exacerbation of mild to moderate acute ulcerative colitis, and for the maintenance of remission in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {We recently described an experimental model in the rat to create recurring chronic ileal inflammation including ulceration. This model is dependent on an "in vivo culture" of normal intestinal contents. In the present experimental study we examined the effect of a polymeric and a hydrolyzed formula diet on the formation of ulcerating lesions using our rat model. Two groups of rats (twenty in each group) were fed either one of these formula diets eight weeks prior to the experimental procedure and this diet was continued until sacrifice eight weeks later. Twenty control rats also underwent the experimental procedure but were fed standard rat pellets for the same time periods. At sacrifice 60% of the control rats had developed ileal ulcers. None of the rats fed the formula diets developed macroscopic ileal inflammation or ulceration. The effectiveness of formula diets in inducing remission in Crohn's disease in humans may be linked to alterations in the intestinal microflora. We hypothesize that the formula diets in this experiment exerted a protective effect against ileal ulceration by altering the ileal microflora. Preliminary studies support this hypothesis but need to be expanded.},
