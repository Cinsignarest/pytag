   abstract = {The provision of food is thought to promote the maintenance of gut integrity. Nutrients are able to elicit and affect both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Enteral diet therapy has long been known to be efficacious in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in childhood Crohn's disease. However, the mechanisms of action of these diets are not clear. Nutritional repletion, direct effects on the gut mucosa or decreased intestinal permeability have all been postulated as being important in nutritional therapy. There is some evidence that the enteral diet has a direct effect on the gut mucosa by reducing cytokine production and the accompanying inflammation, thus leading to decreased intestinal permeability. Modifications of enteral diet composition have been evaluated in many studies. Such modifications include fat and/or protein content and the addition of bioactive peptides. The fatty acid composition of the enteral diet seems to have a much greater impact on its efficacy than modification of the N source. As specific fatty acids are precursors of inflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid, the reduction in these components may be beneficial in nutritional therapy for IBD. Addition of bioactive peptides to enteral diet formulas may also have a role; such peptides may have specific growth factor or anti-inflammatory actions. There is still much work to be done to define disease-specific enteral diet formulas that are effective as therapies for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Differential diagnosis between ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) is difficult in the initial phases in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). This study was performed to determine the significance of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) in IBD. ANCA were specified with regard to their antigenic specifity, significance to the diagnosis, and correlation of titer with the disease activity. The occurrence of food allergy was questioned, too. Serum samples from 44 children with UC (n = 23) or CD (n = 21) and from disease-control children (coeliac disease, n = 21) were analyzed for IgG ANCA, ANCA target antigens, IgA and IgG ASCA, and IgE to food allergens. Results show that ANCA occur more frequently in UC than in CD and disease-control (74, 24, and 10%, respectively). The presence of ANCA does not reflect disease activity. Antigenic specificity does not differ in any group. IgA-ASCA are found more often in patients with CD (76% versus 17% in UC). The testing for both ANCA and ASCA enabled clear-cut differential diagnosis between UC and CD based on the high specificity (ANCA+ ASCA- 92.5% for UC, ANCA- ASCA+ 93.2% for CD). Specific IgE to food allergens were found in 8.7, 14.3, and 23.8% of patients with UC, CD, and coeliac disease, respectively. We conclude that combined testing of ANCA and ASCA represents a valuable tool in the differential diagnosis between UC and CD in pediatric patients, minimizing invasive diagnostic procedures. Monitoring of ANCA, its specificity, and titer determination does not bring more information. Testing for specific IgE to food allergens may be considered in individual patients.},

   abstract = {The aim of the present paper is to briefly review the literature relating to clinical studies of the use of polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The reasons for the discrepancies in the findings could be related to the different study designs, different treatments, overlapping of treatment effects, as well as the variety of treatment formulations and doses used, which have led to results that are, in certain instances, very difficult to explain. Emphasis on a treatment formulation which reduces the incidence of side effects, together with careful selection of patients and experimental design, seems to be associated with benefits, and these studies point to the therapeutic potential for these lipids in the therapy of IBD. It is possible that these fatty acids act by reducing low-grade active inflammation rather than by preventing reinitiation of the inflammatory process from a truly quiescent state. Whether this treatment is applicable to all IBD patients has not been fully elucidated. Nevertheless, taken together, all these studies suggest the effectiveness of these new therapeutic approaches, not only when conventional treatment fails or when it is not possible to treat chronically, but also, in some instances, as first choice.},

   abstract = {The "controlled inflammation" of the normal human gut is a closely controlled phenomenon and any change in the cell type number and/or functions, including the release of soluble mediators can lead to an "uncontrolled" inflammation. The physiological inflammation in the human gut plays a crucial role in maintaining a local immune response that is appropriate, efficiently protective and which respects the gut structure and function. The intestinal mucosa represents a considerable proportion of the human immune system. Disregulation of the mucosal immune response can switch a "controlled" toward an "uncontrolled" intestinal inflammation. A key role in the maintenance of an adequate balance between antigenic stimulation and host immune response is played by the immunoregulatory molecules released by activated immunocytes in the human gut. The role of the host immune system in the maintenance of an adequate balance between luminal antigens, including the resident bacterial flora and host immune response, is strongly supported by animal models of uncontrolled intestinal inflammation. Besides the aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease, luminal antigens (including food, viral and bacterial antigens) contribute to the maintenance of the inflammatory process in inflammatory bowel disease, by stimulating the immunocompetent cells in the intestinal mucosa. Of the luminal antigens, the resident bacterial flora seems to play a major role in the development of animal models of "uncontrolled" intestinal inflammation. Recent evidence also suggest that bacterial flora can modulate the function of the intestinal mucosal cells. These observations support the role of the intestinal bacterial flora in the induction of an uncontrolled inflammation in the human gut, leading to tissue damage. Probiotics, defined as living micro-organisms which, when taken in appropriate amounts, improve the health status, have been proposed in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, but their mechanisms of action still remain to be fully elucidated.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two idiopathic inflammatory disorders of the GI tract. Manifestations of disease can be severe and lead to long term therapy with a variety of medications and/or surgery. Standard medical therapy consists of agents that either treat suppurative complications or modulate the inflammatory cascade in a nonspecific manner. Many specific chemokine and cytokine effectors that promote intestinal inflammation have been identified. Such work has led to experimental clinical trials with a variety of cytokine antagonists. Compounds directed against one such cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), have demonstrated the greatest clinical efficacy to date. This is consistent with scientific observations that suggest a central role for TNF in the inflammatory cascade. Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF that has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of Crohn's disease. Infliximab is Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of Crohn's disease. There exist several other TNF antagonists in various phases of investigation, including the monoclonal antibody CDP 571, the fusion peptide etanercept, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor oxpentifylline, and thalidomide. The clinical efficacy of these agents and the role of TNF in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is reviewed.},

The clinical and biological characteristics are reported for each case. COMMENTS: In view of the frequency of digestive disorders concomitant to eating disorders, the distinction between anorexia and digestive disease is particularly delicate. It requires appropriate somatic and biological assessment that, when confronted with clinical and/or biological atypia, may query the initial diagnosis of anorexia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease. The effect of bacteria on TNF-alpha release by intestinal mucosa was investigated. METHODS: Ileal specimens were obtained at surgery from 10 patients with Crohn's disease (ileal stricture) and five disease controls undergoing right hemicolectomy (caecal cancer). Mucosal explants from each specimen were cultured for 24 hours with either non-pathogenic Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, L bulgaricus LB10, or L crispatus (each study contained blank wells with no bacteria). Tissue and bacterial viability was confirmed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and culture. Concentrations of TNF-alpha were measured in supernatants and the phenotype of the intestinal lymphocytes was analysed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Coculture of mucosa with bacteria did not modify LDH release. Release of TNF-alpha by inflamed Crohn's disease mucosa was significantly reduced by coculture with L casei or L bulgaricus; changes induced by L crispatus or E coli were not significant. The effect of L casei and L bulgaricus was not prevented by protease inhibitors. Coculture with L casei and L bulgaricus reduced the number of CD4 cells as well as TNF-alpha expression among intraepithelial lymphocytes from Crohn's disease mucosa. None of the bacteria induced changes in non-inflamed mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics interact with immunocompetent cells using the mucosal interface and modulate locally the production of proinflammatory cytokines.},

This study was undertaken to investigate the occurrence of lymphoproliferative disorders in patients treated with these agents. METHODS: Relevant data in the MedWatch postmarket adverse event surveillance system run by the US Food and Drug Administration were reviewed. RESULTS: We identified 26 cases of lymphoproliferative disorders following treatment with etanercept (18 cases) or infliximab (8 cases). The majority of cases (81%) were non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The interval between initiation of therapy with etanercept or infliximab and the development of lymphoma was very short (median 8 weeks). In 2 instances (1 infliximab, 1 etanercept), lymphoma regression was observed following discontinuation of anti-TNF treatment, in the absence of specific cytotoxic therapy directed toward the lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Although data from a case series such as this cannot establish a clear causal relationship between exposure to these medications and the risk of lymphoproliferative disease, the known predisposition of patients with RA and CD to lymphoma, the known excess of lymphoma in other immunosuppressed populations, and the known immunosuppressive effects of the anti-TNF drugs provide a biologic basis for concern and justification for the initiation of additional epidemiologic studies to formally evaluate this possible association.},

Other studies have provided further information on the risk factors and predictive biomarkers of bone loss in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The potential role of enteral nutrition as primary therapy for Crohn disease is particularly addressed in the present review. Recent contributions emphasized the special importance of this therapeutic modality in pediatric patients, but the possible mechanisms for such therapeutic effect are still not well understood. Other nutrients may have a therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease. In particular, recent data on the in vivo antiinflammatory action of butyrate merit special mention. Finally, novel nutritional therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease, such as transforming growth factor-beta2-enriched enteral feeding or hydrothermally processed cereals, have recently been explored.},

   abstract = {A number of theories regarding the aetiology of Crohn's disease have been proposed. Diet, infections, other unidentified environmental factors and immune disregulation, all working under the influence of a genetic predisposition, have been viewed with suspicion. Many now believe that Crohn's disease is a syndrome caused by several aetiologies. The two leading theories are the infectious and autoimmune theories. The leading infectious candidate is Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (Mycobacterium paratuberculosis), the causative agent of Johne's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease in a variety of mammals including cattle, sheep, deer, bison, monkeys and chimpanzees. The evidence to support M. paratuberculosis infection as a cause of Crohn's disease is mounting rapidly. Technical advances have allowed the identification and/or isolation of M. paratuberculosis from a significantly higher proportion of Crohn's disease tissues than from controls. These methodologies include: (i) improved culture techniques; (ii) development of M. paratuberculosis-specific polymerase chain reaction assays; (iii) development of a novel in situ hybridization method; (iv) efficacy of macrolide and anti-mycobacterial drug therapies; and (v) discovery of Crohn's disease-specific seroreactivity against two specific M. paratuberculosis recombinant antigens. The causal role for M. paratuberculosis in Crohn's disease and correlation of infection with specific stratification(s) of the disorder need to be investigated. The data implicating Crohn's as an autoimmune disorder may be viewed in a manner that supports the mycobacterial theory. The mycobacterial theory and the autoimmune theory are complementary; the first deals with the aetiology of the disorder, the second deals with its pathogenesis. Combined therapies directed against a mycobacterial aetiology and inflammation may be the optimal treatment of the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) was isolated from intestinal tissue of a human patient suffering Crohn's disease, a controversial discussion exists whether MAP have a role in the etiology of Crohn's disease or not. Raw milk may be a potential vehicle for the transmission of MAP to human population. In a previous paper, we have demonstrated that MAP are found in raw milk samples obtained from a defined region in Switzerland. The aim of this work is to collect data about the prevalence of MAP specific IS900 insertion sequence in bulk-tank milk samples in different regions of Switzerland. Furthermore, we examined eventual correlation between the presence of MAP and the somatic cell counts, the total colony counts and the presence of Enterobacteriaceae. RESULTS: 273 (19.7%) of the 1384 examined bulk-tank milk samples tested IS900 PCR-positive. The prevalence, however, in the different regions of Switzerland shows significant differences and ranged from 1.7% to 49.2%. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant (p >> 0.05) differences between the somatic cell counts and the total colony counts of PCR-positive and PCR-negative milk samples. Enterobacteriaceae occur as often in IS900 PCR-positive as in PCR-negative milk samples. CONCLUSION: This is the first study, which investigates the prevalence of MAP in bulk-tank milk samples all over Switzerland and infers the herd-level prevalence of MAP infection in dairy herds. The prevalence of 19.7% IS900 PCR-positive bulk-milk samples shows a wide distribution of subclinical MAP-infections in dairy stock in Switzerland. MAP can therefore often be transmitted to humans by raw milk consumption.},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis) is the causative agent of Johne's disease, a deadly intestinal ailment of ruminants. Johne's disease is of tremendous economic importance to the worldwide dairy industry, causing major losses due to reduced production and early culling of animals. A highly controversial but developing link between exposure to M. paratuberculosis and human Crohn's disease in some individuals has led to the suggestion that M. paratuberculosis is also a potential food safety concern. As with many other mycobacteria, M. paratuberculosis is exquisitely adapted to survival in the host, despite aggressive immune reactions to these organisms. One hallmark of mycobacteria, including M. paratuberculosis, is their propensity to infect macrophages. Inside the macrophage, M. paratuberculosis interferes with the maturation of the phagosome by an unknown mechanism, thereby evading the host's normal first line of defense against bacterial pathogens. The host immune system begins a series of attacks against M. paratuberculosis-infected macrophages, including the rapid deployment of activated gammadelta T cells, CD4+ T cells and cytolytic CD8+ T cells. These cells interact with the persistently infected macrophage and with each other through a complex network of cytokines and receptors. Despite these aggressive efforts to clear the infection, M. paratuberculosis persists and the constant struggle of the immune system leads to pronounced damage to the intestinal epithelial cells. Enhancing our ability to control this important and tenacious pathogen will require a deeper understanding of how M. paratuberculosis interferes with macrophage action, the cell types involved in the immune response, the cytokines these cells use to communicate, and the host genetic factors that control the response to infection.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The occupational distribution of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may help to shed light on its yet unknown etiology. The U.S. vital statistics offer the opportunity to study cause of death by occupation and industry. METHODS: The numbers of deaths from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were retrieved from the computerized 1991-1996 data files of the National Center for Health Statistics. Deaths were grouped by gender, ethnicity, disease type, occupation, and industry. Mortality by occupation and industry were expressed as proportional mortality ratio (PMR), adjusted for gender and ethnicity. RESULTS: Between 1991 and 1996, 2399 subjects died from Crohn's disease and 2419 subjects died from ulcerative colitis. Significant correlations were found between the PMR values of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease regarding their distribution by occupation, r = 0.36 and p < 0.05, as well as by industry, r = 0.37, p < 0.01. IBD mortality by occupation was significantly reduced among farmers (PMR: 70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 42-97), mining machine operators (31, 95% CI: 0-74), and laborers (71. 95% CI: 45-98). A nonsignificant increase was found among sales persons (117, 95% CI: 95-139) and secretaries (122, 95% CI: 83-161). IBD mortality by industry was significantly reduced in agricultural production of livestock (39, 95% CI: 1-78), mining (46, 95% CI: 9-83), grocery stores (55, 95% CI: 17-94), and work in private households (64, 95% CI: 30-97). A nonsignificant increase was found in food production (128, 95% CI: 74-182), investment and insurance business (137, 95% CI: 77-198), and administration (122, 95% CI: 81-163). CONCLUSIONS: IBD mortality is low in occupations associated with manual work and farming and relatively high in sedentary occupations associated with indoor work. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis show a similar distribution.},

   abstract = {Neutropenia and its subsequent infectious complications represent the most common dose-limiting toxicity of cancer chemotherapy. Febrile neutropenia (FN) occurs with common chemotherapy regimens in 25 to 40% of treatment-naive patients, and its severity depends on the dose intensity of the chemotherapy regimen, the patient's prior history of either radiation therapy or use of cytotoxic treatment, and comorbidities. The occurrence of FN often causes subsequent chemotherapy delays or dose reductions. It may also lengthen hospital stay, increase monitoring, diagnostic and treatment costs, and reduce patient quality of life. A decade after their introduction, colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are now an integral part of the prevention of potentially life-threatening FN; however, only G-CSF has US Food and Drug Administration approval for use in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. These adjunctive agents accelerate formation of neutrophils from committed progenitors, thereby reducing the duration and severity of neutropenia. Important uses of CSFs in oncology are prevention of FN after chemotherapy, treatment of febrile neutropenic episodes and support following bone marrow transplantation, and collection of CSF-mobilised peripheral blood progenitor cells. G-CSF is used more frequently than GM-CSF for all of these indications because of fewer associated adverse effects. Clinical trials to date have not demonstrated a significant effect on overall survival or disease-free survival, which is most likely to be due to small sample size and lack of power to prove effect. However, they have demonstrated clinical utility in allowing the delivery of planned chemotherapy dose on schedule, an important clinical goal especially in curative tumour settings. The high cost of these agents limits their widespread use. Current American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommend primary prophylaxis, or first cycle use, with CSFs being confined to patients with > or = 40% risk of FN, which may include elderly patients and other high-risk patients. In addition to the risk of FN, primary prophylaxis should also be considered if the patient has risk factors that place them in the Special Circumstances category. These risk factors may include decreased immune function in patients who are already at an increased risk of infection and pre-existing neutropenia due to disease, extensive prior chemotherapy, or previous irradiation to the pelvis or other areas containing large amounts of bone marrow. Future studies are needed to better define the patients most likely to benefit from CSF therapy, both for prophylaxis and as an adjunct to antibiotics for treatment of FN. Other potential uses include combination therapy with stem cell factors and other cytokines to boost progenitor cell development, maintaining dose intensity of salvage therapy in metastatic cancer patients, and application in patients with pneumonia, Crohn's fistulas, diabetic foot infections and a variety of other infectious conditions.},

One type has been found in cattle, goats and deer, and the other in sheep, goats and deer. Vaccination has been identified as an important method for the control of Johne's disease in New Zealand but the side effects of the current oil-based vaccines severely limit their use. There is increasing international concern that M. paratuberculosis may cause Crohn's disease in humans. Demands for food free of M. paratuberculosis would have very serious consequences for the meat and dairy industries in New Zealand and overseas.

Corticosteroids, commonly used to control exacerbations, appear to be a major risk factor for subsequent development of osteoporosis. Exclusion diets, avoiding foods that precipitate symptoms, frequently allow control of the disease avoiding the use of corticosteroids and may thereby reduce the risk of osteoporosis. To investigate this we performed bone mineral density measurements of the proximal femur and spine in 95 patients, 31 treated predominately by corticosteroids, 33 by dietary manipulation with a low life-time corticosteroid dose and 31 by treatments other than diets but also with a low life-time corticosteroid dose. In both groups with a low life-time corticosteroid dose bone mineral density was comparable to that of age-matched normal controls, whereas bone mineral density was significantly reduced in those treated predominately by corticosteroids. We conclude that corticosteroid therapy is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis in patients with Crohn's disease and should be used as little as possible.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract constitutes one of the largest sites of exposure to the outside environment. The function of the gastrointestinal tract in monitoring and sealing the host interior from intruders is called the gut barrier. A variety of specific and nonspecific mechanisms are in operation to establish the host barrier; these include luminal mechanisms and digestive enzymes, the epithelial cells together with tight junctions in between them, and the gut immune system. Disruptions in the gut barrier follow injury from various causes including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oxidant stress, and involve mechanisms such as adenosine triphosphate depletion and damage to epithelial cell cytoskeletons that regulate tight junctions. Ample evidence links gut barrier dysfunction to multiorgan system failure in sepsis and immune dysregulation. Additionally, contribution of gut barrier dysfunction to gastrointestinal disease is an evolving concept and is the focus of this review. An overview of the evidence for the role of gut barrier dysfunction in disorders such as Crohn's disease, celiac disease, food allergy, acute pancreatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and alcoholic liver disease is provided, together with critical insight into the implications of this evidence as a primary disease mechanism.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease is associated with an imbalance in cytokine production and defective intestinal barrier function. Previous studies indicate that IL-4, a cytokine increased in food allergy and in early Crohn's disease, enhances epithelial permeability. Here, we characterized the mechanism of action of IL-4 on cultured epithelial cells and examined if the anti-inflammatory cytokines, TGF-beta or IL-10, can modulate the effects of IL-4. METHODS: Confluent monolayers of human T84 epithelial cells were cultured with IL-4 alone or in combination with IL-10 or TGF-beta or with inhibitors of protein synthesis and blockers of IL-4 receptor signalling pathways. Permeability was evaluated by measuring transepithelial resistance (TER), flux of (3)H-fMLP (a small bacterial tripeptide) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (a macromolecule). RESULTS: T84 cells cultured with IL-4 showed a significant drop in TER as well as an increased flux of (3)H-fMLP and HRP. Co-treatment with IL-10 did not improve TER, whereas TGF-beta attenuated the resistance drop. However, neither TGF-beta nor IL-10 were able to correct the increased (3)H-fMLP flux. In contrast, the increased HRP flux caused by IL-4 was inhibited by both IL-10 and TGF-beta. TGF-beta and IL-10 significantly reduced IL-4-enhanced values for endosomal area and paracellular spaces containing HRP. Inhibitor studies indicated the requirement for protein synthesis and the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide new insights into the regulation of intestinal barrier function and may suggest a novel approach in the treatment of intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related intestinal damage. Circulating antioxidants may have a role to play in preventing free radical-mediated tissue injury. METHODS: Plasma vitamin A, E and carotenoid concentrations, leukocytic genomic damage and 8-hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG) concentration were determined in 46 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, 37 Crohn disease (CD) patients and 386 controls. A 20 ml blood sample was taken from each subject for antioxidant and 8-OHdG measurements. A food frequency questionnaire was administered to a sample of subjects from each group to evaluate daily intake of dietary compounds. RESULTS: Antioxidant concentration was significantly reduced in IBD patients, particularly in those with active disease, with respect to controls (P < 0.0001). 8-OHdG concentrations were significantly increased in IBD patients compared to controls, independent of disease activity (P < 0.05). No correlation was found between antioxidant and 8-OHdG concentrations. Carotenoid concentrations were significantly reduced in malnourished IBD patients (0.89 +/- 0.14 micromol/l) compared to patients with normal or high body mass index (1.83 +/- 0.12 micromol/l; P < 0.05), independent of disease activity or extension. Protein, fruit and vegetable intakes of IBD patients were significantly lower than those of controls. CONCLUSIONS: Depletion of antioxidants is likely to be important in the pathophysiology of IBD: UC and CD patients show increased free radical peripheral leukocyte DNA damage and decreased plasma antioxidant defenses. These results indicate the necessity of further studies to establish whether optimal vitamin status may improve the clinical course of UC and CD.},

The interactions that occur between this complex microbial community and the human host have become the focus of scientific research due to increases in the incidence of illnesses associated with deficient or compromised microflora (e.g., gastrointestinal tract infections, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome, antibiotic-induced diarrhea, constipation, food allergies, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers). Effective multidisciplinary research programs now complement conventional microbiology with molecular ecology techniques to provide culture-independent analysis of the gastrointestinal ecosystem. Furthermore, as we acquire an understanding of gut microflora composition and processes such as intestinal adherence, colonization, translocation, and immunomodulation, we are also elucidating mechanisms by which these can be influenced. This knowledge not only allows scientists to define the activities and interactions of "functional food"-borne beneficial bacteria in the gut, but will also provide the scientific basis for the development of innovative biotechnology-based products tailored to prevent specific diseases and promote overall human gastrointestinal health.},

   abstract = {The enteric flora comprises approximately 95% of the total number of cells in the human body and can elicit immune responses while protecting against microbial pathogens. However, the resident bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease). The objectives of the Probiotic Research Group based at University College Cork were to isolate and identify lactic acid bacteria exhibiting beneficial probiotic traits, such as bile tolerance in the absence of deconjugation activity, acid resistance, adherence to host epithelial tissue, and in vitro antagonism of pathogenic microorganisms or those suspected of promoting inflammation. To isolate potentially effective probiotic bacteria, we screened the microbial population adhering to surgically resected segments of the gastrointestinal tract (the environment in which they may subsequently be reintroduced and required to function). In total, 1500 bacterial strains from resected human terminal ilea were assessed. From among these organisms, Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius strain UCC118 was selected for further study. In mouse feeding trials, milk-borne L. salivarius strain UCC118 could successfully colonize the murine gastrointestinal tract. A human feeding study conducted in 80 healthy volunteers showed that yogurt can be used as a vehicle for delivery of strain UCC118 to the human gastrointestinal tract with considerable efficacy in influencing gut flora and colonization. In summary, we developed criteria for in vitro selection of probiotic bacteria that may reflect certain in vivo effects on the host such as modulation of gastrointestinal tract microflora.},

   abstract = {Smoking has a dichotomous effect on inflammatory bowel disease, ameliorating disease activity in ulcerative colitis but having a deleterious effect on Crohn's disease. This effect is thought to be due to nicotine. We investigated the effect of chronic nicotine administration on the small and large bowel in iodoacetamide-induced jejunitis and colitis. Jejunitis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by intrajejunal administration of 0.1 ml 2% iodoacetamide and colitis by intrarectal administration of 0.1 ml 3% iodoacetamide. Nicotine was dissolved in drinking water (12.5 or 250 micrograms/ml), rats drinking ad libitum. Nicotine administration started 10 days prior to damage induction and throughout the experiment and had no effect on weight gain or daily food intake of rats. Rats were killed 5 days after iodoacetamide-induced colitis and 7 days after induction of jejunitis. The jejunum and colon were resected, rinsed, weighed, damage assessed macroscopically and microscopically and tissue processed for myeloperoxidase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) generation. Effects of nicotine on gut microcirculation were also assessed. Nicotine by itself caused no damage to the colon. Nicotine had a dichotomous effect on jejunitis and colitis. At a dose of 12.5 micrograms/ml nicotine improved the macroscopic damage of colitis from 252 +/- 66 to 70 +/- 31 mm2, and segmental weight also declined significantly in the colon (from 1.7 +/- 0.2 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 g/10 cm). In contrast, the same dose of nicotine had a deleterious effect on iodoacetamide-induced jejunitis, increasing the macroscopic damage from 368 +/- 38 to 460 +/- 97 mm2 in rats treated with injury escalating to 970 +/- 147 in rats treated with 250 micrograms/ml nicotine. Nicotine treatment also significantly increased jejunal segmental weight. By itself nicotine did not change NOS activity or PGE2 generation compared to control rats, but it enhanced microcirculation in the colon, whereas in the jejunum nicotine decreased PGE2 generation and increased NOS activity but not jejunal microcirculation. Nicotine has opposite effects on iodoacetamide-induced colitis and jejunitis, which may be partly explained by decreased PGE2 generation and increased NOS activity in the jejunum and an increase in the colonic microcirculation.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by transmural inflammation and granuloma formation. Several theories regarding the etiology of Crohn's disease have been proposed, one of which is infection with Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis), which causes a similar disease in animals, and is present in the human food chain. Considerable evidence supports the presence of M. paratuberculosis in the intestinal tissues of many patients with Crohn's disease including culture, detection of homologous mycobacterial DNA, detection of the mycobacterial insertion sequence IS900 by both PCR and in situ hybridization in tissues, and a serologic immune response to recombinant M. paratuberculosis antigens. Despite this evidence, and our personal belief that M. paratuberculosis is a cause of Crohn's disease, widespread acceptance of this hypothesis will require evidence that specific anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy will cure the disease.},

   abstract = {Maintenance of adequate nutrition is of obvious importance in the management of patients with Crohn's disease. Exclusive parenteral nutrition can achieve high rates of remission, but this is not usually necessary since exclusive elemental and polymeric enteral regimes can yield similarly good results. Comparison of exclusive enteral formula feeding with steroid treatment favours steroids only because compliance is less complete for the restrictive nutritional regimes, and formula feeds should always be the first choice in the growing child with active Crohn's disease. It is probable that the nature of the lipid provided in Crohn's diets is clinically important, and there is some evidence that the n-3 fatty acids are beneficial. Continuation of nutritional supplements once remission has been obtained appears valuable even when malnutrition is not a major consideration.},

A growing body of literature, however, is defining the dynamic role of esophageal protective mechanisms and is identifying the immunologic milieu present within the squamous mucosa. When the innate protective mechanisms are overcome by an injurious agent, an inflammatory process ensues, and the clinicopathologic features of esophagitis are manifest. This article focuses on features of several causes of esophagitis in children, including peptic disease, duodenogastroesophageal reflux, Crohn's disease, and infection.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases of unknown etiology. Unspecific immunosuppressive therapy represents current standard treatment and is often associated with severe side effects. Several treatment regimens have been evaluated to identify alternative therapeutic options. Among these different diet therapies were investigated. Objective of this paper is to review the results of diet therapy in chronic inflammatory bowel disease on the basis of randomised controlled trials and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: Medline and Cochrane Library were searched for meta-analysis and randomised controlled trials investigating this question. Additionally reference lists of identified articles and text books were checked for further trials. RESULTS: Four meta-analyses investigated the treatment of acute Crohn's disease with elemental-, semi-elemental-, and polymeric diets in comparison to corticosteroids or to another form of enteral diet. All meta-analyses show a superiority of corticosteroids and no difference in the effect of the compared enteral diets. Randomised controlled trials investigating diet therapy in ulcerative colitis have not been summarised in a meta-analysis yet. Eleven randomised trials were identified which evaluated diets in ulcerative colitis patients: Dietary supplementation with n-3-fatty acids (6 trials), elemental diet [2], dietary supplementation with dietary fiber [1], elimination diet [1], and dietary supplementation with olestra [1]. Only for the elimination diet a significant positive effect on the course of disease was found in one trial which investigated only 18 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutritional therapy of acute Crohn's disease is less effective than treatment with corticosteroids. In case of severe steroid induced side effects diet treatment can present a promising alternative. Superiority of one of the investigated different formulations was not found. Meta-analyses of randomised trials provide a clear and easy to understand presentation of the effect of this intervention. Eleven published trials investigating the effect of diets in ulcerative colitis show only for elimination diet a positive treatment effect. The trials do find a positive effect of one of the other interventions but the trials are very small and cannot exclude a treatment effect. Meta-analysis of these trials would be helpful for a better presentation and understanding of these results.},

It has been suggested that this organism is associated with Crohn's disease in humans, and milk is a potential source of human exposure to this organism. A total of 18, including 7 regular batch and 11 high temperature short time (HTST) pasteurization experiments, were conducted in this study. Raw milk or ultra-high temperature pasteurized milk samples were spiked at levels of 10(3), 10(5), and 10(7) cfu of Mptb/ml. Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium bovis BCG strains at 10(7) cfu/ml were used as controls. Pasteurization experiments were conducted using time and temperature standards specified in the Canadian National Dairy Code: regular batch pasteurization method: 63 degrees C for 30 min, and HTST method: 72 degrees C for 15 s. The death curve of this organism was assessed at 63 degrees C. No survivors were detected after 15 min. Each spiked sample was cultured in Middlebrook 7H9 culture broth and Middlebrook 7H11 agar slants. Samples selected from 15 experiments were also subjected to BACTEC culture procedure. Survival of Mptb was confirmed by IS900-based PCR of colonies recovered on slants. No survivors were detected from any of the slants or broths corresponding to the seven regular batch pasteurization trials. Mptb survivors were detected in two of the 11 HTST experiments. One was by both slant and broth culture for the sample spiked to 10(7) cfu/ml of Mptb, while the other was detected by BACTEC for the sample spiked to 10(5) cfu/ml. These results indicate that Mptb may survive HTST pasteurization when present at > or = 10(5) cfu/ml in milk. A total of 710 retail milk samples collected from retail store and dairy plants in southwest Ontario were tested by nested IS900 PCR for the presence of Mptb. Fifteen percent of these samples (n = 110) were positive. However, no survivors were isolated from the broth and agar cultures of 44 PCR positive and 200 PCR negative retail milk samples. The lack of recovery of live Mptb from the retail milk samples tested may be due to either the absence of live Mptb in the retail milk samples tested or the presence of low number of viable Mptb which were undetected by the culture method used in this study.},

In the past year significant work has been published examining the mechanisms of impaired food intake in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, which allow a better understanding of these processes. Data from the same laboratory have shed further light on the relative role of underfeeding and inflammation on the growth retardation associated with intestinal inflammation. Other studies have provided further data on the risk factors and predictive biomarkers of bone loss in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The potential role of enteral nutrition as primary therapy for Crohn's disease is particularly addressed in this review. Recent contributions to the field emphasized the special importance of this modality of therapy in paediatric patients. The possible mechanisms for such a therapeutic action are not well understood. Other nutrients may have a therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease. In particular, recent data on the in-vivo anti-inflammatory actions of butyrate merit special mention. Finally, novel nutritional therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease, such as transforming growth factor-beta2-enriched enteral feeding, or hydrothermally processed cereals have recently been explored.},

AIM: To assess the efficacy of two whole protein based diets with different fat compositions (n6 polyunsaturated fatty acids v monounsaturated fatty acids) in inducing clinical remission in active Crohn's disease compared with steroids. METHODS: Sixty two patients with active Crohn's disease were randomised to receive, for not more than 4 weeks: (a) a polymeric enteral diet containing 35 g of lipids per 1000 kcal, high in oleate (79%) and low in linoleate (6.5%) (PEN1), (b) an identical enteral diet except for the type of fat which was high in linoleate (45%) and low in oleate (28%) (PEN2), or (c) oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day). Diets were double blindly administered. The steroid group received a conventional ward diet. Treatment failure was considered when remission was not achieved at week 4. Clinical activity and biological and nutritional parameters were monitored. Independent predictors of remission were identified by stepwise logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall remission rates (by intention to treat) were 20% (4/20) for PEN1, 52% (12/23) for PEN2, and 79% (15/19) for steroids (overall p=0.001; p<0.0005 steroids v PEN1, and p=0.056 PEN2 v PEN1). After excluding those patients who were non-compliant during the first week (per protocol analysis), remission rates were 27%, 63%, and 79%, respectively (p=0.008, steroids and PEN2 v PEN1). After adjusting for confounding variables, PEN1 remained significantly associated with a poor response. CONCLUSION: The type of dietary fat may be of importance for the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in active Crohn's disease.},

Encouraging results have been obtained with probiotic therapy in several animal models of experimental colitis. The administration of highly concentrated probiotic preparations represents a valid approach both for the prevention of pouchitis onset and relapses. The encouraging results obtained in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease need to be further assessed in large double-blind trials.},

By December 2000, it had completed phase II trials for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) [393219]. In March 2001, the FDA designated CBP-1011 an Orphan Drug for the treatment of thrombocytopenic pupura [400935]. In June 2000, InKine reported that a US patent (subsequently identified as US-06068983, entitled 'Methods of stimulating phagocytosis' and assigned to University of Pennsylvania) had been issued to Alan D Schreiber MD, Chairman of InKine's Scientific Advisory Board. The patent describes methods of increasing Fc receptors on white blood cells or macrophages, as well as inducing Fc receptors in cells that do not normally possess them, such as lung and liver cells [370990]. In April 2001, the University of Pennsylvania (inventor again Alan D Schreiber) claimed the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate for treating IBD, CD, UC, food allergies, hemorrhoids and psoriasis in WO-00122959, entitled 'Method of treating inflammatory conditions with progesterone or progesterone analogs'.},

   abstract = {Modifying the diet can have a favorable impact on the course of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. In contrast, nutrition plays no major role in the development of the disease or in provoking an acute attack. During an acute attack of Crohn's disease, the application of oral (drinks) or tube feeding (enteral nutrition) can result in a substantial clinical improvement. The remission rate of this side effect-free therapy is, however, lower than that seen with steroids. The data available for diet therapy in ulcerative colitis are less unequivocal, but the effects are probably slight at best. During the remission phase, the patient should eat a balanced, vitamin-rich and varied normal diet that excludes all poorly tolerated foods: lactose intolerance in particular appears to be increased in patients with Crohn's disease. Known vitamin or mineral deficiencies should be corrected by appropriate dietary measures or supplementation. There is no such thing as a "Crohn's diet" or "colitis diet". The patient can be allowed to eat anything that is tolerated.},

A defect in mucosal barrier function could allow luminal bacterial antigens to initiate the chronic relapsing inflammation in Crohn's disease. The potential role of luminal bacteria in initiating the abnormal immune response seen in inflammatory bowel disease is stressed by many observations. A pilot study to investigate the possible effect of Lactobacillus GG in children with active Crohn's disease was conducted. Four male patients were enrolled, median age 14.5 years (range 10-18). In terms of clinical outcome, the patients showed significant improvement. In three patients on Lactobacillus GG, it was possible to taper the dose of steroids. Thus, although our data are obviously very preliminary, Lactobacillus GG appears to be effective in improving the clinical status of children with Crohn's disease. A multicentre study is currently being carried out in 7 US University centres in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion to establish the efficacy of this probiotic in children with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic debilitating inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology. Proposed causes include bacterial or viral infection, diet or exposure to tobacco smoke, genetic abnormality, and immune dysfunction. The bacterium Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) has received much research attention as a potential cause of the disease. Map causes Johne's disease in ruminants. The pathology of Johne's disease superficially resembles that of Crohn's disease in humans. Some researchers have shown evidence of Map in intestinal tissues of Crohn's disease patients. Studies are in progress to investigate the possibility that Map exists in milk from infected cows and survives pasteurization. This is a controversial subject with the potential for media attention and public outcry. We examined the current literature and concluded that insufficient evidence exists at this time to implicate any one factor, including Map in milk, as the definitive cause of Crohn's disease. The high degree of uncertainty in this issue requires regulators to recognize the need for effective risk communication as ongoing research provides additional information about the disease.},

   abstract = {The primary function of the gastrointestinal system is to assist the intake and further processing of food and liquids. Besides that, it forms an anatomical barrier between the external environment and internal milieu. It is also highly important for its paracrine and endocrine function. Inflammatory bowel diseases, which frequently cause a gastrointestinal failure, form a specific group. Most frequently it is the ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Impaired integrity of the gastrointestinal mucosa and failure of protective mechanisms lead to the increased permeability of the intestinal wall for antigens derived from food, saprophytic bacteria and pathogenic microorganisms. When the gastrointestinal failure is threatening, factors determining its residual function become more important. As decisive reveals the severity and location of the primary disease. Previous surgeries and adaptation of the residual part of the gastrointestinal system are important, as well as the possibility of peroral or enteral nutrient intake. Depending on the presence of risk factors and the degree of residual gut function, some complications can be expected: dehydration, mineral disorders, symptoms of protein and energy depletion, infection, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. It is highly important to decide whether the gastrointestinal system will be included into or excluded from the process of realimentation. Critically ill patients with inflammatory bowel diseases should be treated at an intensive care unit.},

L/R ratio (lactulose/1-rhamnose urinary excretion ratio) is considered an indicator of permeability of the small intestine. An increased L/R ratio is caused by mucosal disorders of the small intestine. The L/R ratio in all patients (n = 92) with Crohn's disease was 0.079 +/- 0.081 (mean +/- S.D.), which was significantly higher than the value in normal controls (0.027 +/- 0.009, n = 20, p < 0.05). In 39 patients with Crohn's disease, we assessed intestinal permeability before after treatment with an elemental diet, and during remission. The L/R ratio was 0.120 +/- 0.092, before treatment and 0.065 +/- 0.097 after treatment (p < 0.05), showing increased intestinal permeability before elemental dietary treatment. During remission, the L/R ratio was 0.035 +/- 0.028; this did not differ significantly from the value obtained after treatment. We conclude that intestinal permeability is useful for investigating disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) is intestinotrophic, antisecretory, and transit-modulating in rodents, and it is mainly secreted from the intestinal mucosa of the terminal ileum and colon after food ingestion. We assessed the effect of GLP-2 on the gastrointestinal function in patients without a terminal ileum and colon who have functional short-bowel syndrome with severe malabsorption of wet weight (>1.5 kg/day) and energy (>2.3 MJ/day) and no postprandial secretion of GLP-2. METHODS: Balance studies were performed before and after treatment with GLP-2, 400 microg subcutaneously twice a day for 35 days, in 8 patients (4-17 years from last bowel resection; 6 with Crohn's disease). Four patients received home parenteral nutrition (mean residual jejunum, 83 cm), and 4 did not (mean ileum resection, 106 cm). Biopsy specimens were taken from jejunal/ileal stomas, transit was measured by scintigraphy, and body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Treatment with GLP-2 improved the intestinal absorption of energy 3.5% +/- 4.0% (mean +/- SD) from 49.9% to 53.4% (P = 0.04), wet weight 11% +/- 12% from 25% to 36% (P = 0.04), and nitrogen 4.7% +/- 5.4% from 47.4% to 52.1% (P = 0.04). Body weight increased 1.2 +/- 1.0 kg (P = 0.01), lean body mass increased 2.9 +/- 1.9 kg (P = 0.004), fat mass decreased 1.8 +/- 1.3 kg (P = 0.007), and 24-hour urine creatinine excretion increased (P = 0.02). The time to 50% gastric emptying of solids increased 30 +/- 16 minutes from 89 to 119 minutes (P < 0.05). Small bowel transit time was not changed. Crypt depth and villus height were increased in 5 and 6 patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with GLP-2 improves intestinal absorption and nutritional status in short-bowel patients with impaired postprandial GLP-2 secretion in whom the terminal ileum and the colon have been resected.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infliximab is a humanized antibody against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) that is used in the treatment of Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Approximately 147,000 patients throughout the world have received infliximab. Excess TNF-alpha in association with tuberculosis may cause weight loss and night sweats, yet in animal models it has a protective role in the host response to tuberculosis. There is no direct evidence of a protective role of TNF-alpha in patients with tuberculosis. METHODS: We analyzed all reports of tuberculosis after infliximab therapy that had been received as of May 29, 2001, through the MedWatch spontaneous reporting system of the Food and Drug Administration. RESULTS: There were 70 reported cases of tuberculosis after treatment with infliximab, for a median of 12 weeks. In 48 patients, tuberculosis developed after three or fewer infusions. Forty of the patients had extrapulmonary disease (17 had disseminated disease, 11 lymph node disease, 4 peritoneal disease, 2 pleural disease, and 1 each meningeal, enteric, paravertebral, bone, genital, and bladder disease). The diagnosis was confirmed by a biopsy in 33 patients. Of the 70 reports, 64 were from countries with a low incidence of tuberculosis. The reported frequency of tuberculosis in association with infliximab therapy was much higher than the reported frequency of other opportunistic infections associated with this drug. In addition, the rate of reported cases of tuberculosis among patients treated with infliximab was higher than the available background rates. CONCLUSIONS: Active tuberculosis may develop soon after the initiation of treatment with infliximab. Before prescribing the drug, physicians should screen patients for latent tuberculosis infection or disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To discover the prevalence and significance of lymphonodular hyperplasia (LNH) of the lower gastrointestinal tract, the authors did a retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of children using colonoscopy to evaluate persistent and severe gastrointestinal symptoms. The authors also sought to discover in more detail how often subjects with LNH of the terminal ileum (TI) or colon show an association with food allergy (FA). METHODS: The analysis included a consecutive series of 140 children evaluated at the Oulu University Hospital using colonoscopy, which extended to the TI in 74 of these children. A total of 102 patients underwent gastroduodenoscopy. The disease category was assessed using endoscopic, histopathologic, and clinical information. To diagnose FA, a masked or an open food challenge was administered to all patients who aroused any suspicion of food-related exacerbation of symptoms. RESULTS: Of 140 patients, LNH of the colon was diagnosed in 46 subjects, 9 of 38 patients had colitis, 1 of 8 patients had Crohn disease, and 36 of the remaining 94 subjects did not have colitis. Twelve patients of the 22 with LNH of the colon (55%) showed concomitant LNH on the bulb of the duodenum. Lymphonodular hyperplasia of the TI was diagnosed in 53 of the 74 subjects in whom TI could be visualized. It was seen in most patients without colitis (80%), in one half the subjects with colitis (48%), and in one quarter of those with Crohn disease (25%). Among the whole study group 37 (26%) could be defined as having FA. It was more prevalent in patients with (52%) than in those without (13%) LNH of the colon ( P < 0.001). The presence of LNH in the TI also showed some association with FA ( P < 0.05), but less than did LNH of the colon. CONCLUSION: We consider LNH on the mucosa of the colon or TI common but not an innocent bystander. Significantly related to a diagnosis of gastrointestinal FA in this study, it is an expression of mucosal immune response. If detected on the colon, FA should be considered, whereas if present in TI, it may be related to FA but also to a variety of other immunologically active disease states.},

In this study we sought to determine whether children with LNH of the terminal ileum (TI) show a similar correlation. METHODS: The mucosal specimens taken by colonoscopy from the TIs of 22 children with LNH of the TI without colitis, 13 with right-sided colitis or pancolitis, nine with left-sided colitis, eight with Crohn's disease, and three endoscopically healthy subjects were studied for T-cell subsets with monoclonal antibodies using a three-layer peroxidase staining method. RESULTS: LNH of the TI was found in 32 of the 55 subjects (58%). In 22 it was the only endoscopic finding, but in nine of 13 subjects (69%) it was related to right-sided colitis or pancolitis. In patients with left-sided colitis or Crohn's disease it was diagnosed only rarely. In the whole study population, LNH of the of the TI showed a significant association with the increment in the density of gammadelta+ T-cells. The subjects with LNH of the TI and colitis starting from the cecum showed the highest values, discriminating them statistically from any other study group. Accordingly their gammadelta+/CD3+ ratio was high. Even in the subjects with LNH of the TI without colitis, the increment in gammadelta+ T-cells was significant as compared with the subjects with left-sided colitis. Upregulations of D-related expression on the mucosa of the TI were similar regardless of the presence of LNH or colitis or an increment in gammadelta+ T-cells. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary observations showed increased densities of intraepithelial gammadelta+ T-cells and elevated gammadelta+/CD3+ ratios in subjects with LNH on the mucosa of the TI, especially if related to colitis starting at the cecem, but not in subjects with typical left-sided colitis or granulomatous Crohn's disease. The study also provides further evidence suggesting the significance of food-borne antigens in the pathogenetic mechanism of right-sided colitis or pancolitis. The finding also indicates the significance of classifying colitis into gammadelta-positive and -negative diseases, and has implications for the treatment of these entities.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Two tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) antagonists were recently licensed in the US. Infliximab was licensed in 1998 for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD), and since 1999, it has been licensed in combination with methotrexate for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Etanercept was licensed in 1998 for treatment of RA and, more recently, for juvenile RA and psoriatic arthritis. Because of potential immunosuppression related to use of anti-TNFalpha agents, we sought to identify postlicensure cases of opportunistic infection, including histoplasmosis, in patients treated with these products. METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) passive surveillance database for monitoring postlicensure adverse events was reviewed to identify all reports received through July 2001 of histoplasmosis in patients treated with either infliximab or etanercept. RESULTS: Ten cases of Histoplasma capsulatum (HC) infection were reported: 9 associated with infliximab and 1 associated with etanercept. In patients treated with infliximab, manifestations of histoplasmosis occurred within 1 week to 6 months after the first dose and typically included fever, malaise, cough, dyspnea, and interstitial pneumonitis. Of the 10 patients with histoplasmosis, 9 required treatment in an intensive care unit, and 1 died. All patients had received concomitant immunosuppressive medications in addition to infliximab or etanercept, and all resided in HC-endemic regions. CONCLUSION: Postlicensure surveillance suggests that acute life-threatening histoplasmosis may complicate immunotherapy with TNFalpha antagonists, particularly infliximab. Histoplasmosis should be considered early in the evaluation of patients who reside in HC-endemic areas in whom infectious complications develop during treatment with infliximab or etanercept.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polymeric feeds have shown variable efficacy in active Crohn's disease (CD) with remission rates from 36% to 82%. Meta-analyses of elemental, peptide, and whole protein feeds have shown a strong negative correlation between remission rate in CD and the long chain triglyceride (LCT) content of the feed. We performed a randomised controlled double blind trial in patients with active CD comparing two single whole protein feeds with LCT supplying 5% or 30% of the total energy. METHODS: Fifty four patients with active CD (Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) >200, serum C reactive protein (CRP) 10 mg/l) were randomised to a high or low LCT feed for three weeks. The total amount of energy supplied by fat was identical in the two feeds. Remission was defined as a CDAI < or =150 and response as a fall in CDAI of > or =70 or a CRP <10 mg/l. RESULTS: Overall remission rate by intention to treat was 26% for the low LCT feed and 33% for the high LCT feed (p=0.38). Response was achieved in 33% with the low LCT and in 52% with the high LCT feed (p=0.27). CRP <10 mg/l was achieved in 30% in the low LCT and 33% in the high LCT group (p=0.99). Thirty nine per cent (21/54) of patients withdrew before three weeks because of inability to tolerate the diet. Excluding patients unable to tolerate the diet, remission rates were 46% for low LCT and 45% for high LCT (p=0.99). DISCUSSION: This trial has shown no difference in the effect of low and high LCT whole protein feeds in active CD. The previously reported correlation between LCT content of diet and response in active CD is unlikely to be due to LCT itself and may be due to some other component of high LCT feeds.},

Following peroral infection with 100 cysts of the ME49 strain of T. gondii, C57BL/6 mice die within 13 days after infection, whereas BALB/c mice survive. At day 7 of infection, massive necrosis of the villi and mucosal cells in the ilea is observed in C57BL/6 but not BALB/c mice. CD4(+) T cells, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and inducible nitric oxide synthase mediate the development of necrosis. These findings indicate a Th1-type immunopathology, with parasite replication appearing to be involved in the first 3 days of infection. Murine and human studies on the immunopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease) also indicate a Th1-type immunopathology. The shared and distinct features of oral infection of mice with T. gondii and murine models of inflammatory bowel disease are discussed herein.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract serves as a barrier between the host and the vast array of foreign antigens that are contained within its lumen. The mucosal immune system must balance two opposing functions: to mount an immune response to pathogens, whilst maintaining tolerance to antigens derived from commensal bacteria and food. This balance is regulated by both cellular interactions and the release of soluble mediators called cytokines. Diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are characterized by alterations in the balance of pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines. Interleukin-10 is a regulatory cytokine which inhibits both antigen presentation and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine release. In addition, there is evidence that it promotes the formation of antigen-specific regulatory T-cell clones. The pivotal role played by interleukin-10 within the mucosal immune system is demonstrated both by the chronic ileocolitis that develops in gene-targeted interleukin-10 knock-out mice, and by its therapeutic efficacy in several animal models of colitis. However, trials of daily systemic interleukin-10 administration in patients with Crohn's disease have reported only a modest clinical response. Advances in the analysis of functional polymorphisms in the interleukin-10 gene may allow therapy to be targeted to patients who will respond. Finally, therapeutic strategies utilizing gene therapy may enhance mucosal delivery and increase therapeutic response.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unknown, although in recent years more data have become available. The contribution of genetic and environmental factors is evident, and the luminal bacterial flora plays a major role in the initiation and perpetuation of chronic IBD. Animal models of IBD have shown that colitis does not occur in a germ-free environment. In human IBD, inflammation is present in parts of the gut containing the highest bacterial concentrations. Moreover, the terminal ileum, caecum and rectum are areas of relative stasis, providing prolonged mucosal contact with luminal contents. Enhanced mucosal permeability may play a pivotal role in maintaining a chronic inflammatory state, due to a genetic predisposition or as a result of direct contact with bacteria or their products. A detective epithelial barrier may cause a loss of tolerance to the normal enteric flora. Furthermore, an increased mucosal absorption of viable bacteria and bacterial products is found in IBD. Serum and secreted antibodies are increased and mucosal T-lymphocytes that recognize luminal bacteria are present. However, there is evidence that the immune system reacts over aggressively towards the normal luminal flora rather than the flora being altered in IBD. Several approaches have been used in attempts to discover a specific microbial agent in the cause of IBD. These include demonstration of the presence of organisms or specific antigens in affected tissues, culture of microbes firm the affected tissues, demonstration of serological responses to several agents, and localization and detection of individual pathogen-specific nucleic acid sequences in affected tissue by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. So far, no specific micro-organism has been directly associated with the pathogenesis of IBD. Analysis of the luminal enteric flora, however, has revealed differences in the composition of this flora compared to healthy controls. In Crohn disease, concentrations of Bacteroides, Eubacteria and Peptostreptococcus are increased, whereas Bifidobacteria numbers are significantly reduced. Furthermore, in ulcerative colitis, concentrations of facultative anaerobic bacteria are increased. The arrival of new molecular techniques qualifying and quantifying the complex intestinal flora has induced a revival of interest in this microflora. Therapeutic approaches geared towards changing the environment at the mucosal border have been attempted by the use of elemental diets, total parenteral nutrition, surgical diversion of the faecal stream and antibiotics. Over the past few years, the use of probiotics in IBD and other intestinal disorders has gained attention. Strengthened by promising experimental data and commercial interests, research in this field is rapidly expanding. Manipulation of the colonic bacteria with antibiotic drugs and probiotic agents may prove to be more effective and better tolerated than immunosuppressants in the future.},

Following recent findings that microparticles accumulate in the phagocytes of intestinal lymphoid aggregates, this study is the first investigation of whether their reduction in the diet improves the symptoms of Crohn's disease. METHODS: In a double blind study, 20 patients with active corticosteroid-treated ileal or ileo-colonic Crohn's disease randomly received either a low microparticle diet (trial group; n = 10) or a control diet (n = 10) for 4 months. Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and corticosteroid requirements were compared. RESULTS: One patient in each group was withdrawn. In the trial group there was a progressive decrease in CDAI from entry (392 +/- 25) to month 4 (145 +/- 47) (P = 0.002 vs control group) and seven patients were in remission (CDAI <150). In contrast, the control group had returned to baseline levels (302 +/- 28 on entry and 295 +/- 25 at month 4), with none in remission. Corticosteroid intake was reduced more in the trial group although this did not reach significance. CONCLUSIONS: A low microparticle diet may be effective in the management of ileal Crohn's disease and could explain the efficacy of elemental diets, which similarly are low in microparticles.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a modern Western disease characterised by transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. It is of unknown aetiology, but evidence suggests that it results from a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Bacterial-sized microparticles (0.1-1.0 microm) are potent adjuvants in model antigen-mediated immune responses and are increasingly associated with disease. Microparticles of TiO2 and aluminosilicate accumulate in macrophages of human gut-associated lymphoid tissue where the earliest signs of lesions in Crohn's disease are observed. Dietary microparticles are of endogenous or exogenous origin. Endogenous microparticles dominate and are calcium phosphate (most probably hydroxyapatite), which precipitates in the lumen of the mid-distal gastrointestinal tract due to secretion of Ca and phosphate in the succus entericus. Exogenous dietary microparticles are contaminants (soil and/or dust) and food additives. TiO2, for example, is a food colourant, and aluminosilicates are anti-caking agents, although some aluminosilicates occur as natural contaminants. Food additives alone account for ingestion of approximately 10(12) particles/person per d. Possible mechanisms for the role of exogenous and endogenous dietary microparticles in promoting toleragenic or immune responses of gastrointestinal mucosal phagocytosis are discussed. In a double-blind randomised pilot study we have shown that a diet low in Ca and exogenous microparticles appears to alleviate the symptoms of ileal Crohn's disease, with a significant (P= 0.002) improvement in the Crohn's disease activity index. A multi-centre trial and further mechanistic studies at the cellular level are underway.},

This possibility, and the fact that M. paratuberculosis may be present in raw milk, make it important to ensure that the heat treatment specified for pasteurization of milk will give acceptable inactivation of this bacterium, with an adequate margin of safety. Published studies of the heat resistance of this bacterium in milk have given widely differing results. Possible reasons for these differences, and the technical problems involved in the work, are reviewed. It is concluded that there is a need (i) for the adoption of an agreed Performance Criterion for pasteurization of milk in relation to this bacterium, (ii) a need for definitive laboratory experiments to understand and determine the heat resistance of M. paratuberculosis, and (iii) a need for an assessment of whether the minimum heat treatments specified at present for pasteurization of milk (Process Criteria) will meet the Performance Criterion for M. paratuberculosis. Measures are also required to ensure that commercial processes deliver continually the specified heat treatment, and to ensure that post-pasteurization contamination is avoided.},

   abstract = {AIM: To study the influence of food on the systemic availability of budesonide in patients with active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Eight patients with an established diagnosis of Crohn's disease each received 9 mg budesonide controlled ileal release (CIR) capsules (Entocort capsules) orally on two separate occasions: once in a fasting state and once after a heavy breakfast. For reference, deuterium-labelled ((2)H(8)) budesonide, 0.5 mg, was given intravenously. Plasma concentrations of budesonide and (2)H(8)-budesonide were determined for 12 h, and their pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. RESULTS: Average systemic availability of budesonide during fasting conditions was 10.7%, area under the curve was 27.5 nmol/L x h and peak plasma concentration was 4.1 nmol/L. Corresponding postprandial values were 13.2%, 27.0 nmol/L x h and 3. 8 nmol/L. Food increased the mean absorption time from 4.5 to 6.8 h (P=0.0012). Body clearance of budesonide was about 25% higher after eating (P=0.0015). CONCLUSIONS: Food had little influence on systemic availability and peak plasma concentrations of budesonide administered in CIR capsules. Absorption was retarded postprandially, likely due to delayed gastric emptying. Budesonide in CIR capsules can be administered at the same dose regardless of prandial status in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease likely involves multifactorial interactions between genetic factors and environmental triggers. The most recent studies suggest that luminal bacteria are a significant factor in the onset and chronicity of inflammation. In interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene-deficient mice a Crohn's-like colitis develops when the mice are raised under conventional animal care facilities but fails to develop when they are raised under germ-free conditions. These mice demonstrate significant alterations in the species and the levels of bacteria colonizing the colon, suggesting that genetic factors in the host may be critical in controlling bacterial colonization. In addition, early treatment of IL-10 gene-deficient mice with antibiotics can prevent the development of colitis in later life, suggesting that early events during the neonatal period can influence later disease progression. Recent work has focused on using probiotic bacterial mixtures to alter the microbial balance in the colon in attempts to reduce inflammation. The use of the VSL-3 probiotic mixture in the IL-10 gene-deficient mouse resulted in a complete normalization of physiological transport function and barrier integrity, in conjunction with a reduction in mucosal secretion of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Further, it would appear that a soluble factor is released from a bacterium found in the VSL-3 mixture that can act directly on the epithelium to enhance barrier integrity. Results from animal models of inflammatory bowel disease suggest that genetically susceptible hosts can mount a pathogenic cellular immune response to specific nonpathogenic bacterial species, as a consequence of defective immunologic tolerance and lack of appropriate mucosal defences. Probiotic bacteria appear to be a promising new alternative for the treatment of clinical conditions that are associated with alterations in gut barrier function, including Crohn' s disease.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are living microorganisms that can affect the host in a beneficial manner. Prebiotics are nondigestible food ingredients that stimulate the growth and activity of probiotic bacteria already established in the colon. Efficacy of probiotic compounds has been shown in a wide range of gastrointestinal diseases. Lactobacillus GG alone, or the combination of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus, is effective in the treatment of Clostridium difficile, as well as in preventing the frequency and severity of infectious acute diarrhea in children. Prevention of antibiotic-induced diarrhea with the concomitant administration of either Lactobacillus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii has been demonstrated. The most successful studies involve the use of Lactobacillus GG at a dose of 1 x 1010 viable organisms per day and the yeast boulardii at a dose of 1 g/day. A probiotic preparation (VSL#3 - 6 g/day) that uses a combination of three species of Bifidobacterium, four strains of Lactobacillus and one strain of Streptocccus has shown promise in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis and pouchitis, as well as in preventing the postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease. The mechanism of action of probiotics may include receptor competition, effects on mucin secretion or probiotic immunomodulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Oral administration of probiotic compounds has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and safe. However, while probiotics have the potential to improve human health and to prevent and treat some diseases, major improvements are needed in labelling and quality assurance procedures for probiotic compounds. In addition, well planned and controlled clinical studies are necessary to delineate fully the potential for probiotic compounds.},

   abstract = {The aetiology and pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) remain to be elucidated. In addition to genetic influences and immune mediated cytokine gene activation, various specific and non-specific environmental factors are considered to be associated with the induction and/or exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The incidence of CD is higher in urban areas than in the rural, environment. Patients with CD have a higher dietary intake of sucrose, refined carbohydrates and (omega-6 fatty acids, and reduced intake of fruit and vegetables. Elemental and exclusion diets are known to be effective in CD. However, patients relapse on returning to a normal diet, which suggests that there is something in an ordinary diet which, on penetrating the mucosal defence mechanism of the terminal ileum, generates a pathogenic immune process. It has been suggested that the urban diet contains large quantities of inert inorganic non-nutrient microparticles, such as natural contaminants (soil and dust), food additives and anti-caking agents which may combine with intestinal luminal components such as bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharides, to form antigenic particles. When these are taken up by mucosal mononuclear cells they can mediate immune reactions both locally in the mucosa and in the systemic circulation. In a study published in this issue of the journal, CD patients allocated to a low microparticle diet experienced a significant reduction in CD activity and the requirement for corticosteroids, when compared with the control group on a normal diet. The main advantage of the microparticle free diet, when compared with elemental and exclusion diets, is its enhanced tolerance by the patients and its relatively low cost. The preliminary results may give an explanation for the rising incidence of the disease in urban society. The results of an on-going multi-centre trial by the authors are awaited with interest.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanism of action of elemental diet in Crohn's disease treatment, is unknown. Alteration of bacterial flora, low antigenicity, low fat content and improvement of nutritional status are postulated to play a role in the anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet. AIM: To determine whether elemental diet or its modifications has a direct anti-inflammatory effect on colonic tissue biopsies in vitro. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Colonic or ileal biopsies from 39 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and control patients were incubated for 24 hours with enteral diets in which nitrogen sources were amino acids as in elemental diet, casein or whey. Tissues were incubated with elemental diet, casein or whey, at dilutions of 1:5, 1:10 or 1:20 in Waymouth's complete medium; a medium control was also included. Tissue viability was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and interleukin-10 concentrations in supernatants were measured by immunoassay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). RESULTS: Incubation of tissues from Crohn's disease with elemental diet resulted in an increase in the ratio of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta vs control statistically significant at 1:10 (89.6+/-17 vs 45.7+/-9. 1, p<0.05). Incubation of Crohn's tissue with casein resulted in a significant increase of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio at dilutions 1:20, 1:10 and 1:5 (101.8+/-22.0, p=0.05, 142.8+/-24.6, p<0.05; 109.7+/-25.0, p=0.05). In ulcerative colitis tissue and non-inflamed non-inflammatory bowel disease control tissue, no significant increase in interleukin 1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio was seen after incubation with elemental diet, casein and whey. CONCLUSION: Elemental diet incubation increases anti-inflammatory:proinflammatory cytokine ratio in Crohn's disease and this anti-inflammatory effect is not specifically due to amino acid composition, as diets containing casein have similar anti-inflammatory effects.},

The effect of various immune and neuronal stimuli on human colonic substance P (SP) release and the effect of SR140333 on subsequently stimulated mucosal ion transport was investigated. 2. Submucosal and sensory nerve fibre stimulation using electrical field stimulation (1 ms/7 Hz/7 V) and capsaicin (50 microM) respectively, mast cell activation by anti-IgE (1/250 dilution) and granulocyte stimulation using fMLP (50 microM) each released SP and evoked a secretory response. 3. SP and the NK(1) selective agonist, Sar-SP (0.1 - 1000 nM) stimulated an increase in colonic secretion which was antagonized by SR140333 (pD'(2)=6.7 and 7.25 versus SP and Sar-SP respectively). 4. SR140333, at a concentration that blocked NK(1)-mediated secretion (500 nM), also reduced the secretory response to both alphaIgE and capsaicin. This suggests a pathophysiologic role for NK(1) receptors. 5. Capsaicin evoked SP release was increased in tissue taken from Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis patients. The response to SP was however reduced by 70 and 89% respectively. 6. Mast cells and sensory afferents contribute to allergic diarrhoea. Since SR140333 reduced the secretory response to mast cell and afferent stimulation this compound may be particularly useful in reducing the symptoms of food allergy.},

It has been suggested that this organism is associated with Crohn's disease in humans, and that milk is a potential source of human exposure to this organism. The limit of the detection of M. paratuberculosis in milk samples by direct PCR was 10(5) cfu/mL if the traditional boiling method was used for template DNA preparation. In this study, an improved method for template DNA preparation was examined. The method involves the use of a bead beater, which breaks up bacterial cell wall mechanically by vibrating bacteria with microbeads at high speed. The effectiveness of this method for lysing M. paratuberculosis cells was compared to that of the freeze-thaw method, and use of commercial kits such as the InstaGene Matrix and the QIAamp Tissue Kit. The bead beater procedure was tested in combination with various cell lysis and template DNA preparation procedures to determine which of these steps improved the limit of detection of PCR assay that amplifies a 413 bp fragment of the IS900 gene. Results showed that the use of the bead beater, in combination with the use of lysis buffer, boiling, and isopropanol precipitation, decreased the limit of detection of M. paratuberculosis in milk by the PCR to 10(2) cfu/mL. The limit of detection was further decreased to 10 cfu/mL when 0.0037% bovine serum albumin was included in the PCR reaction mixtures. The improved assay was 10- to 10(4)-fold more sensitive than the PCR assays using template DNA prepared by other lysis procedures including boiling alone, freeze-thaw plus boiling, or use of commercial kits for lysis.},

The aim of this randomised placebo controlled study was to determine if Lactobacillus GG, given by mouth for one year, could prevent Crohn's recurrent lesions after surgery or to reduce their severity. METHODS: Patients operated on for Crohn's disease in whom all of the diseased gut had been removed were randomly allocated to receive 12 billion colony forming units of Lactobacillus or identical placebo for one year. Ileocolonoscopy was performed at the end of the trial or at the onset of symptoms. Endoscopic recurrence was defined as grade 2 or higher of Rutgeerts scoring system. RESULTS: Eight of 45 patients were excluded from the trial (three for non-compliance and five for protocol violations). Clinical recurrence was ascertained in three (16.6%) patients who received Lactobacillus and in two (10.5%) who received placebo. Nine of 15 patients in clinical remission on Lactobacillus (60%) had endoscopic recurrence compared with six of 17 (35.3%) on placebo (p=0.297). There were no significant differences in the severity of the lesions between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus GG seems neither to prevent endoscopic recurrence at one year nor reduce the severity of recurrent lesions.},

PEF treatment at 50 degrees C (2,500 pulses at 30 kV/cm) reduced the level of viable M. paratuberculosis cells by approximately 5.3 and 5.9 log(10) CFU/ml in 0.1% peptone water and in cow's milk, respectively, while PEF treatment of M. paratuberculosis at lower temperatures resulted in less lethality. Heating alone at 50 degrees C for 25 min or at 72 degrees C for 25 s (extended high-temperature, short-time pasteurization) resulted in reductions of M. paratuberculosis of approximately 0.01 and 2.4 log(10) CFU/ml, respectively. TEM studies revealed that exposure to PEF treatment resulted in substantial damage at the cellular level to M. paratuberculosis.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The objective of the presented work is to evaluate to what extent the CO2 production and O2 utilization and energy metabolism at rest (REE) are influenced by an excessive nutrient intake and to what extent by the composition of enteral nutrition. REE, CO2 production and O2 utilization were investigated in 9 patients on complete enteral nutrition by indirect calorimetry in four modifications: I--nutrition with 40% kJ fat in a ration 1.2x the energy output at rest at the onset of the trial; II--40% kJ and high energy intake (2.4x energy output at rest; III--60% kJ fat in ration of 1.2x energy output at rest; IV--60% kJ fat and energy intake 2.4x energy output at rest. At 40% (I) and 60% (III) fat content in a caloriocally adequate diet the energy output at rest, the CO2 production and O2 utilization did not differ (mean +/- SD: 1438 +/- 264.1 kcal/24 h, 179 +/- 31.6 nl/min, 209 +/- 38.1 ml/min vs. 1431 +/- 342.7, 190 +/- 54.2, 207 +/- 46.5). Comparison of modifications II and IV revealed a significant (p < 0.05) increase of CO2 production on a diet rich in carbohydrates (218 +/- 52.0 vs. 202 +/- 42.3). The energy output at rest (1674 +/- 389.6 vs. 1661 +/- 378.7), nor O2 production (240 +/- 54.5 vs. 242 +/- 55.4) changed. Overfeeding with 40% fat (II) as compared with (I) led to a rise of the energy output at rest (p < 0.05), O2 utilization (p < 0.05) and CO2 production (p < 0.01). Overfeeding with lipids (IV) led as compared with III to a rise of the energy output at rest and O2 utilization; CO2 production did not change. CONCLUSION: The composition of enteral nutrition according to the described modification does not influences the energy output at rest, O2 utilization and CO2 production under conditions of an adequate energy intake. In case of an excessive nutrient intake nutrition with 60% fat does not lead to an increase of CO2 production.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal dietary fat content to induce clinical remission in active Crohn's disease has been the subject of controversy. We therefore performed a prospective, randomized, controlled study to compare the effects of nutrient formulas differing in the amount of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). METHODS: Thirty-six patients with active Crohn's disease whose Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) was > or =150 were included in the study. A formula with 3.4 g of fat per 2000-kcal dose was used as the nutrient formula with a low-fat content (ED group), and a formula with 55.6 g of fat per 2000-kcal dose was used as the nutrient formula with a high amount of MCT (TL group). RESULTS: The rate of short-term remission induction at 6 weeks was 67% in the ED group and 72% in the TL group (p = NS). Therapy markedly reduced the high CDAI and van Hees activity index in both groups, with no significant difference in the pattern of the time-course changes. C-reactive protein levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and low serum albumin and plasma prealbumin levels normalized over the course of therapy, with no significant difference between the 2 groups. The assessment of fatty acid fractions revealed that the triene/tetraene ratio began to increase at 2 weeks in the ED group. The serum levels of linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, almost always varied within the normal range during the treatment period in the TL group, but in the ED group, levels began to decrease significantly at 2 weeks. The levels of linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid, decreased in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both nutrient formulas induced clinical remission in about two-thirds of patients. The results of the present study suggest that it is not necessary to restrict the amount of MCT when given in liquid form to patients with active Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Biological therapies are being increasingly investigated for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. However, a great deal more study has been devoted to studies of Crohn's disease rather than ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis, like Crohn's disease, represents an area of high clinical need, particularly for those patients who have disease inadequately responsive to corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylates. The distinct anatomic distribution of inflammation in ulcerative colitis represents an important model for study, with the entire involved mucosa entirely accessible to endoscopy. In addition, there is an opportunity for local delivery of biologic agents in left-sided disease. Distinct pathogenetic factors in ulcerative colitis raise the possibility of therapies quite different from those used in Crohn's disease. This work describes the current state of knowledge regarding biological therapy in ulcerative colitis. The role of probiotic therapy, and studies of cytokine-directed therapies, therapies targeting adhesion and recruitment, and restitution and repair are described.},

Appendicitis has an incidence of about 5-10% of the number likely to be observed in a white population. The conundrum is that the disparity exists despite many Africans having adopted an urbanized lifestyle with major changes in their dietary pattern. Dietary fiber intake, which was previously 30-35 g, has decreased to 12-14 g daily. Studies on small bowel function in black people have shown that physiological malabsorption of lactose, fructose, sucrose and maize (the staple food) occurs. It is hypothesized that the increased concentration of substrate available for fermentation in the colon compensates for the low dietary fiber intake, is protective to the large bowel and is a factor in the prevention of 'developed society' large bowel diseases in the African population.},

   abstract = {Probiotic therapy is attracting the renewed interest of clinicians and basic investigators from a variety of traditional research disciplines. While the theoretical rationale for modifying the commensal flora of the gastrointestinal tract in specific circumstances appears sound and requires scientific pursuit, the field of probiotics has been clouded by exaggerated claims from some quarters. In general, many of the claims for therapeutic efficacy have not been well substantiated, but the field is now poised for evaluation within the realm of evidence-based medicine. Alterations in commensal bacterial flora within the gastrointestinal tract are associated with susceptibility to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile and there is persuasive evidence that the normal flora may participate in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic diseases in genetically susceptible individuals. This has prompted various strategies to fortify or otherwise modify the enteric flora by dietary supplements containing probiotic formulations. Detailed comparisons of probiotic performance amongst different bacterial strains have not been performed in vivo in man or under clinical trial conditions, and the level of scientific characterisation of individual organisms has been variable. In addition, it cannot be assumed that the same probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Moreover, the heterogeneity of clinical disorders such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis implies that strain-specific properties may be required for subset-specific categories of patients. While cocktails of probiotics offer convenience, therapeutic progress may require clarification of the mechanism of probiotic action and may be delayed until individual bacterial components have been rigorously studied. More importantly, the full potential of therapeutic manipulation of the enteric flora with probiotics or other strategies may not be optimally realised until the composition and metabolic activities of the normal flora are better understood.},

The basis of abnormal puberty in these patients is multifactorial. Nutritional deficiency may contribute to growth disorders and delayed puberty. Insufficient food supply and/or eating disorders and/or malabsorption of nutrients can be observed in these patients. Moreover, increased energy supplies are often needed in patients with chronic lung disease, infection or inflammation. More specific factors due to the disease itself may be involved in growth and puberty disorders. Abnormalities of the growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor (IGF)1 axis and gonadotrophin secretion have been described in patients with chronic renal failure, cystic fibrosis and Crohn's disease. More recently, it has been shown that cytokines produced during chronic diseases such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis may affect the GH-IGF1 axis. Finally, concomitant medication, namely corticosteroids, which are often given to these patients, may contribute to delayed puberty and poor pubertal growth.},

No effective prophylactic treatment is available for these patients. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether zinc supplementation may improve intestinal permeability. METHODS: We studied 12 patients with quiescent Crohn's disease who had been in remission for at least 3 months and had increased intestinal permeability on two separate occasions within the last 2 months. Patients received oral zinc sulfate supplements (110 mg three times a day) for 8 weeks and were followed-up for 12 months thereafter to monitor relapses. RESULTS: We found that the lactulose/mannitol ratio was significantly higher before supplementation than after (0.041 +/- 0.003 versus 0.026 +/- 0.005). During follow-up, 10 patients had normal intestinal permeability and did not relapse; of the remaining two who had increased intestinal permeability, one relapsed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that zinc supplementation can resolve permeability alterations in patients with Crohn's disease in remission. Improving intestinal barrier function may contribute to reduce the risk of relapse in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the humoral and cellular immune response against cow's milk proteins in Behcet's disease and to distinguish any behaviour during active or inactive disease. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 16 patients and from eight normal controls were cultured in the presence of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), beta-casein, beta-lactoglobulin, or chicken egg albumin. Interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and interleukin 4 (IL4) were measured in the culture supernatants by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum samples from 46 patients with Behcet's disease and from 37 healthy subjects were also studied for antibody detection. Antibodies to beta-casein, beta-lactoglobulin, and chicken egg albumin were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: High IFNgamma but not IL4 levels were found in the supernatants of lymphocytes from patients with active disease cultured in the presence of cow's milk proteins. Levels were comparable with those obtained in cultures stimulated with PHA. A significantly higher level of anti-beta-casein and anti-beta-lactoglobulin IgG and IgA antibodies was found in patients with active Behcet's disease. No relation was found between their occurrence and the age of the patients, the duration of disease, or the presence of gastrointestinal abnormalities. Antibodies to chicken albumin were detected at low levels and with a prevalence similar to that of healthy subjects. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that an active immune response occurs in Behcet's disease. This response involves an increased frequency of antibodies to cow's milk protein and a strong Th1 polarisation after exposure to these antigens. The occurrence of these abnormalities supports a putative role for cow's milk proteins immune response in the pathogenesis of Behcet's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food antigens may contribute to gut inflammation in Crohn's disease. AIM: To assess in vivo sensitization to food antigens, ascertain whether sensitivity is gut specific, assess food sensitization in vitro, and correlate in vivo changes with histological and blood changes. METHODS: Skin testing and rectal exposure to six food antigens (cereal, cabbage, citrus, milk, yeast and peanut) and control saline were assessed double-blind by immediate and 3.5-h laser Doppler blood flowmetry, and rectal biopsies were taken. Peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation was measured in response to the same antigens. RESULTS: Ten patients with Crohn's disease and 10 healthy controls were studied. Blood flow increased in 24 of 60 antigen sites in Crohn's disease patients and six of 60 antigen sites in controls (P < 0.0001) after 3.5 h. The Crohn's disease group demonstrated higher rectal blood flow than controls in response to all food antigens, and this was significantly different for the responses to yeast (P = 0.036) and citrus fruits (P = 0.038). Lymphocyte proliferation occurred in 32 of 60 tests in Crohn's disease patients and eight of 60 tests in controls (P < 0.0001). There were no skin responses. Submucosal oedema corresponded to increased mucosal flow. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease patients demonstrate in vivo and in vitro sensitization to food antigens, which is gut specific. Mucosal flowmetry allows the identification of sensitization to gut antigens.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Complex food proteins and enteric flora may act as antigenic stimuli in Crohn's disease. This study assessed the prevalence and magnitude of lymphocyte priming to these antigens in Crohn's disease. METHODS: A total of 31 Crohn's disease patients (median age 42 years, range 25-72 years) and 22 healthy controls (median 29 years, 23-43 years) were studied. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were collected and incubated with antigens in hanging drop culture for 4 days. The antigens tested were cow's milk, cereals, cabbage group, citrus group, peanut group, Saccharomyces (yeast), Bacteroides, E. coli and Klebsiella. On the 4th day 3H-thymidine incorporation was measured after a 4-h pulse. Responses to antigens were considered positive if mean proliferative values were above the 99% confidence interval for background proliferation. RESULTS: The mean background and mitogen-stimulated proliferation did not differ between patients and controls. The mean proliferation to antigens was not above background in controls, but in Crohn's patients proliferative responses to all food and bacterial antigens were significantly higher than background values. Twenty-three out of 31 Crohn's patients and five out of 22 controls (P=0.0003) responded to one or more antigens. Sixteen Crohn's patients and two controls responded to four or more antigens (P=0.001, Fisher's exact test). CONCLUSION: The reactivity of peripheral lymphocytes to food, yeast and bacterial antigens, especially multiple antigens, is common in Crohn's disease. These sensitized lymphocytes may contribute to the inflammatory process.},

   abstract = {The mucosal immune system is an integral part of the whole-body immune system, however its regulation, maturation and function are to a great degree independent. Mucosal lymphoid tissue is the largest immune organ of the body, that stands in the first line of defence against foreign invaders. The goal of the immune system is immunity, however immunologic unresponsiveness (tolerance) is a key feature of the mucosal immune system, because the organism must tolerate thousands of ingested and inhaled harmless food and bacterial antigens. The phenomenon of oral tolerance is the unique feature of the mucosal immune system. If abrogated, severe autoimmune diseases like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or coeliac sprue can develop. The quality of mucosal immune responses during newborn and infant age strongly influences the immune reactivity later in life. The most important factors influencing the development of mucosal immune reactivity are the feeding practices and microbial colonization. Manipulation of the mucosal immune system offers interesting possibilities to prevent infection as well as autoimmune diseases directly in the affected tissue, without participation of the whole-body immune system. In this review we present the most recent basic information about the mechanisms of mucosal immunity, ontogeny of mucosal immunity, mucosal tolerance and immunisation and the role of mucosal immunity in an inherited disease in which the main battlefield is the lung mucosa-cystic fibrosis.},

   abstract = {A substantial number of patients with inflammatory bowel disease use complementary therapies to manage their disease, including chiropractic and herbal therapies. The objective of this study was to explore whether providers of these therapies see patients with inflammatory bowel disease and recommend therapies, and to determine their opinions about the treatments that they recommend. The study sample comprised 66 chiropractors, 19 pharmacists, 16 herbalists and 15 health food store employees in Calgary, Alberta. A structured questionnaire containing two patient scenarios (a patient with active ulcerative colitis and a patient with inactive Crohn's disease) was completed either by an in-person interview or by a mailed questionnaire. Most respondents had seen patients with ulcerative colitis, and at least 80% of each group except pharmacists (only 10%) would treat these patients or recommend treatment. Almost all chiropractors used spinal manipulation, whereas herbalists and health food store employees suggested a wide range of different treatments. Chiropractors rated their treatment as moderately effective; herbalists and health food store employees viewed their recommendations as very effective. The results with respect to the second scenario were very similar. The wide range of treatment recommendations by practitioners, who differ greatly in terms of skills, knowledge and experience, has important implications for physician-patient communication, information provision and education regarding complementary and alternative therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy plays an important role in the management of Crohn disease, particularly during the acute phase. Nutritional supplementation may also prevent relapses during the quiescent phase of Crohn disease, though this aspect has not been widely explored. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with Crohn disease in remission were studied. All had steroid-dependent disease. Patients were randomized to receive either elemental diet (n = 19, EO28 Extra) or polymeric diet (Forticips, n = 14). The supplement was given orally in addition to normal food in an amount to provide 35%-50% of pre-trial total calorie intake. Prednisolone was withdrawn gradually. Patients were followed up for 12 months. Failure was defined as increase in CDAI by 100 points from baseline to >200, inability to withdraw chronic steroid therapy completely, need for surgery or steroid therapy. RESULTS: The nutritional supplement was successful in 14 (43%) patients who remained in remission for 12 months with complete withdrawal of steroids. The response to elemental diet (42%) was similar to that of polymeric diet (43%). Nutrition supplement failed in 13 (39%). Six (18%) patients were intolerant to enteral feeding because of smell and taste problems. Per-protocol analysis of data indicated that the success rate of nutrition supplement in steroid-dependent patients was 52% (14 out of 27 patients). No disease or patient-related factors helped predict the response to nutrition supplement. CONCLUSION: Nutritional supplementation with either an elemental or polymeric diet may provide a safe and effective alternative to chronic steroid therapy in patients with steroid-dependent Crohn disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease is controversial. Increasing research on the mechanisms by which nutritional therapy improves the clinical well being of patients with Crohn's disease has led to novel formula design and trials comparing two different forms of enteral nutrition. This systematic review aims to provide an update on the existing efficacy data for both corticosteroids versus enteral nutrition and for one form of enteral nutrition versus another for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of exclusive enteral nutrition as primary therapy to induce remission in Crohn's disease and to examine the importance of formula composition on efficacy. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were selected using a computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic databases MEDLINE (1966-2000) and EMBASE (1984-2000), as well as the Science Citation Index on Web of Science. Additional citations were sought by manual search of references of articles retrieved from the computerized search, abstracts submitted to major gastroenterologic meetings and published in the journals: Gut, Gastroenterology, Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, and Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, and from the reviewers' personal files or contact with leaders in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials involving patients with active Crohn's disease defined by a clinical disease activity index were considered for review. Studies evaluating the administration of one type of enteral nutrition to one group of patients and another type of enteral nutrition or conventional corticosteroids to the other group were selected for review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers and any discrepancies were resolved by rereading and discussion. For the dichotomous variable, achievement of remission, individual and pooled trial statistics were calculated as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); both fixed and random effect models were used. The results for each analysis were tested for heterogeneity using the chi square statistic. The studies were separated into two groups: A. one form of enteral nutrition compared with another form of enteral nutrition and B. one form of enteral nutrition compared with corticosteroids. Subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of clinical or disease criteria and formula composition. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the basis of the inclusion of abstracts of studies not yet fully published, methodologic quality and by random or fixed effects models. MAIN RESULTS: In part A, of the 11 trials (one abstract) comparing different formulations of enteral nutrition ten compared one [or more (Middleton (a)1995)] elemental formulas to a non-elemental diet. The eleventh study (Akobeng 2000) compared two non-elemental diets differing only by glutamine enrichment in one group. This study was therefore not included in the primary analysis but was part of the subgroup analyses. Meta-analysis of nine studies which included 170 patients treated with an elemental diet and 128 patients treated with a non-elemental diet for active Crohn's disease demonstrated no significant difference among diet formulations [OR 1.15 (95% CI: 0.64, 2.08)]. Significant heterogeneity was not present [chi-square 9.77 (df=8)]. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses had no significant effect on the results. In part B, six trials (two abstracts) comparing enteral nutrition to steroid therapy met the inclusion criteria for review. Meta-analysis of four trials that included 130 patients treated with enteral nutrition and 123 treated with steroids yielded a pooled OR of 0.30 favouring steroid therapy (95% CI: 0.17, 0.52). Heterogeneity was not demonstrated [chi-square 0.43 (df=3)]. The risk difference calculated from this meta-analysis was 0.26, and the NNT (number of patients needed to treat with steroids rather than enteral nutrition to achieve one remission) was four. The same result was found in a sensitivity analysis that included abstracts. The inclusion of abstracts resulted in an increase in the number of participants to 150 in the enteral nutrition group and 142 in the steroid group but the meta-analysis yielded a similar result [OR 0.34 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.56)]. There were inadequate data from full publications to perform further subgroup analyses by age, disease duration and disease location. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid therapy is more effective than enteral nutrition for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease as was found in past meta-analyses. There is no significant difference in the efficacy of elemental and non-elemental diets for induction of remission of Crohn's disease.},
