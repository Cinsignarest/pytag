   abstract = {1. Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional disorder of the lower intestinal tract affecting approximately 10% of the population and causing a wide range of symptoms. 2. Most cases of irritable bowel syndrome can be diagnosed in general practice on the basis of the presenting history and clinical examination but some patients may need to be referred to a gastro-enterologist for further assessment including sigmoidoscopy and barium enema. 3. The clinical picture may include symptoms of abdominal pain and/or distension and altered bowel habit. Nausea, dyspepsia, gynaecological or bladder symptoms are also common. About a third of patients may give a family history of recurrent abdominal pain. 4. Clinical signs include general anxiety, scars on the abdomen (from previous laparotomies for severe abdominal pain), a palpable and tender left colon or generalized abdominal tenderness, and loud borborygmi. 5. Absolute indications for a specialist assessment are: weight loss rectal bleeding onset of symptoms after the age of 40 a mass. Even in the absence of any of these findings referral is frequently necessary to allay patient anxiety and reinforce the diagnosis. 6. Blood tests are usually non-contributory. Stool specimens should be sent if diarrhoea is a feature. 7. A full explanation emphasizing the benign and often recurrent nature of the condition should be given to help patients understand the nature of their symptoms. Only after review of lifestyle and advice about diet have been provided should drug therapy be tried.},

   abstract = {The major aims of medical therapy in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are: a) to ameliorate symptoms (pain, bowel movement abnormalities, bloating) and b) to improve psychological problems of the patients. The first step of IBS therapy is the diet. In fact some forms of IBS can be ascribed to food intolerance. When abdominal pain, meteorism and constipation are the main symptoms, treatment with high-fiber diet, antispastic and antimuscarinic drugs is indicated. Sometimes amitriptyline, an antidepressant which also shows anticholinergic and analgesic properties, can be helpful. When diarrhoea is prevalent, the most effective drug is represented by loperamide. If diarrhoea is related to meal ingestion, antispastic or antimuscarinic drugs can be successfully used. In the case of diarrhoea related to documented cholorrhoea, cholestyramine can be of benefit. Furthermore, there are some resistant cases, secondary to striking psychological problems that require sedatives and antidepressant drugs and sometimes, psycho and/or hypnotherapy.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in the field of neuroimmunology have provided clear demonstrations of i) the neuromodulation of immune function, and ii) the involvement of the immune system in responses induced by psychologic stress in animals and in man. This has led to speculation about the role of the immune system in psychosocial disease. The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction, which may reflect in altered motility, epithelial function, or sensory perception in the gut. IBS is heterogeneous not only in terms of its clinical presentation but also in terms of its pathogenesis, and factors ranging from psychoneurotic behavior and emotional stress, to dietary fiber deficiency, food intolerance, and enteric infection have been implicated. There is evidence of an increase in the inflammatory cells present in the gut of some IBS patients and in an emerging literature that demonstrates the immunomodulation of the motor system of the gut. These findings invite speculation that the immune system may play a role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of at least a subpopulation of IBS patients.},

   abstract = {The irritable bowel syndrome is a highly prevalent condition whose underlying aetiology is not understood. While many patients respond to a combination of gastrointestinal antispasmodics, bulking agents and dietary manipulation, controlled clinical trials have suggested that the benefit is only marginal and is due mainly to the large placebo effect found in this condition, which has been calculated to range between 54 and 81%. Associations between the syndrome and psychological and social stresses suggest, however, that treatment involving a systematic approach to the management of symptoms may hold out real therapeutic possibilities. In the current study, 42 IBS patients were randomly allocated to either medical treatment or to behavioural psychotherapy with a nurse therapist. They were assessed initially and at 4 and 9 months. There was a general improvement over the 9 months on a number of physical and psychological symptoms measured. However, no differences were found between treatment groups except for changes in two avoidance scores. A significant correlation was found, however, between improvement in the bowel symptoms of IBS (stomach pain and diarrhoea) and improvement in the psychological symptoms measured by the Clinical Interview Schedule, suggesting a close interrelationship between the two.},

It is, therefore, not surprising that disturbed gastrointestinal functions may be altered through psychological therapy approaches. For motor dysfunctions of the esophagus and functional dyspepsia, there is a lack of behavioral therapy studies, while controlled studies utilizing relaxation techniques, stress management strategies and anxiety treatment have been shown to improve symptoms and prevent recurrence in reflux esophagitis and peptic ulcer disease despite the wide use of effective medication. Most studies have treated patients with symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome: This approach usually combined conventional medical treatment with psychotherapy. Psychological management usually consisted of relaxation training, stress management and patient information. Additional behavioral modification, e.g. of eating and defecation behavior, is superior to pharmacological and dietary management alone. The role of biofeedback therapy in these patients remains to be clarified in the future. It is, however, therapy of choice in some patients with constipation due to spastic pelvic floor syndrome and in fecal incontinence, if the external anal sphincter is insufficient to maintain continence. There ist a systematic lack of treatment opportunities as compared to the number of patients seeking health care for functional bowel disorders.},

Although only a small proportion of those afflicted seek medical help for their symptoms, a subset have severe and intractable symptoms. A positive diagnosis should be established from the history and physical examination; endoscopic and radiologic investigations should be minimized. We suggest that the physician also assess the severity of the illness based on its symptomatic and functional features and the patient's behavioral response. Classifying the disorder in this manner permits a graduated treatment approach that emphasizes education, reassurance, and dietary adjustment for mild symptoms. Moderate symptom severity requires, in addition, identification and modification of factors exacerbating symptoms, psychotherapeutic and behavioral techniques and, if a certain symptom type predominates, pharmacologic agents directed toward the presumed gastrointestinal motor dysfunction. For severe symptoms, physician-based behavior modification and psychopharmacologic agents are helpful. When the disorder is intractable, referral may be needed, for example, to a pain treatment center. In all cases, the skillful physician must ensure continued psychosocial support to enhance coping and continued focus on the palliative aspects of care rather than on cure.},

Clinical acceptance of food sensitivity has been delayed by the use of dubious diagnostic techniques by a minority of practitioners and the lack of laboratory diagnostic tests, but several double blind studies have now fully validated the existence of food sensitivity syndromes. More widespread recognition of food sensitivity would be cost effective for the National Health Service.},

Pretreatment constipation was related to baseline fibre intake. Overall outcome was the same in treated and control groups; a considerable placebo response was evident. This level of fibre supplementation is not a useful treatment; improving neither constipation nor other symptoms. At the outset pain severity correlated with depression score on psychometric testing. Those who felt better at the end of the study scored significantly lower for depression at outset than those who felt no better. In irritable bowel syndrome a depressive emotional state profile is a powerful determinant of outcome, shaping the response to treatment, which includes a considerable placebo element.},

Evaluation of the impact of diet in the individual patient requires a precise dietary history and a 7-day prospective dietary analysis, which should include the quality and quantity of food consumed, chronologic sequence and nature of symptoms, and the frequency and consistency of bowel movements. The caloric density of the meal, total fat intake, the quantity and quality of lactose-containing foods, sorbitol, fructose, and the nature and quantity of soluble and insoluble fiber intake must be noted. Patients with reflux esophageal symptoms should eliminate foods that decrease LES pressure, such as chocolate, peppermint, alcohol, and coffee. Direct esophageal mucosal irritants such as tomatoes, citrus juices, sharp condiments, and alcohol should be limited. Gastric emptying is slowed with the ingestion of fats and soluble fiber. Small bowel motility is slowed by soluble fiber and fatty foods. Gaseous syndromes may be reduced by avoidance of smoking, chewing gum, excessive liquid intake, and carbonated drinks. The reduced intake of large amounts of lactose-containing foods, sorbitol, and fructose may limit postprandial bloating. Flatus production can be lowered by reducing fermentable carbohydrates such as beans, cabbage, lentils, brussel sprouts, and legumes. Soluble and insoluble fiber ingestion will reduce sigmoidal intraluminal pressures and overcome spastic constipation when given in progressive graded doses. Effective dietary manipulations remain a key factor in reducing symptoms in IBS.},

   abstract = {Individualization of treatment for patients with IBS is predicated on a thorough analysis of the patient's symptoms, consideration of the reasons for seeking health care, evaluation of symptom-precipitating factors, elimination of confounding features, and the absolute knowledge of the absence of organic illness. Collecting and codifying appropriate historical data allow the physician to educate the patient with respect to the origin of his symptoms, and to enlist the patient as a partner in his future health care. There is no single, universally accepted therapeutic agent available for the treatment of the IBS patient. As a result, treatment is directed at reducing the frequency and intensity of triggering factors as well as ameliorating the symptoms when they arise. Symptoms evoked by psychologic factors may be effectively reduced by psychotherapy or hypnotherapy. Situational anxiety may be treated for brief periods by using antianxiety agents such as diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, buspirone, or similar agents. Depressive reactions may be reduced with suitable doses of antidepressant agents such as amitriptyline. Smooth muscle hyperreactivity may be dulled with small amounts of selected anticholinergics, which are usually most effective in reducing meal-induced discomfort. Peppermint oil may be of additional benefit. Gas-related symptoms require elimination of contributory dietary factors, such as lactose-containing foods, sorbitol, or fructose, as well as certain oligosaccharides. Simethecone, charcoal, or beanase may be helpful. Functional constipation is best treated with graded doses of insoluble or soluble fiber. Diarrheal episodes may be reduced with either loperamide or diphenoxylate. Careful, continued follow-up assessment of therapeutic endeavors, a sincere interest in the patient's concerns, and surveillance for intercurrent organic illness are the cornerstones of complete ongoing care.},

Characteristic symptoms, in addition to upper abdominal pain or discomfort, are nausea, vomiting, early satiety, anorexia, postprandial abdominal bloating and excessive repetitive postprandial belching. Patients with concomitant symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are currently excluded from this clinical entity. Delayed gastric emptying of solids and/or liquids, postprandial antral hypomotility and antroduodenal incoordination, gastric myoelectrical arrhythmias and dysfunction of visceral afferents are the major alterations in upper gut sensorimotor activity which have been described. An empirical trial of medical therapy is warranted if there are no "alarm" symptoms at presentation. If symptoms are not relieved after 2-4 weeks, then investigations of the upper gastrointestinal tract, preferably by endoscopy, to exclude the presence of organic disease, is advisable. Management approaches are then reassurance, dietary manipulations and attention to psychosocial aspects. Prokinetic agents appear to be useful as short-term medical therapy in some patients, but optimum long-term treatment strategies, including the use of medications which may improve a diminished tolerance to gut distension, are not established.},

Dietary fibre intakes were measured after 6 months by a 7-day weighed food inventory. There was a significant inverse association between the presence of symptoms and fibre intake for: incomplete defaecation, urgency and hard stools with total fibre intake; urgency and hard stools with cereal fibre intake; and borborygmi with fibre intake at breakfast. All patients with constipation, mucus, urgency or watery stools at the beginning of the study, and who were consuming more than 30 g fibre by the end, reported an improvement in these symptoms. Increasing intakes of fibre were not related in any way to abdominal distension, diarrhoea, flatulence or patient's feelings about the working of their bowels. Therefore, this study suggests that the symptoms which benefit most from the prescription of a high-fibre diet are hard stools, constipation and urgency.},

Twenty-seven patients had multiple pains and 58 described a single pain, which was intermittent in 39. A detailed analysis of the symptoms and family history of the latter group suggested that in 19 patients the symptoms might have been caused by abdominal migraine. Six of these 19 had typical migraine-associated symptoms during the attack, characteristic abdominal pain and a family or personal history of classical migraine. Abdominal migraine should be considered in patients with non-organic abdominal pain where symptoms are not typical of irritable bowel syndrome and when organic disease has been excluded.},

Patients with constipation are recommended to take dietary fiber positively, while those with diarrhea should consume sparingly food which may cool their body. Both should avoid overeating and overdrinking, and have regular dietary habits. In order to improve the functional disorder of the bowel, it is necessary for those patients (1) to be careful not to take often refined cereals or manufactured foods, (2) to eat green and yellow vegetables and seaweeds positively, as well as, protein and fat in proper quantity, and (3) to take care of the well-balanced intake of various kinds of vitamins, minerals and other nutriments.},

Irritable bowel syndrome patients and controls had similar fasting (27.4 +/- 5.1 vs. 35.2 +/- 4.3 pg/ml; mean +/- S.E.M. and integrated increment of post-prandial (5105 +/- 858 vs. 3885 +/- 793 pg.min/L) plasma concentrations of somatostatin, as assessed by student's t-test. These observations do not support the idea that a state of somatostatin deficiency exists in the irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is defined as a functional bowel disorder in which abdominal pain is associated with defecation or a change in bowel habit, and with features of disordered defecation and distension. The irritable bowel syndrome occurs in 10 to 20% of people worldwide and is very commonly encountered in clinical practice. This has encouraged the pharmaceutical industry to search for effective drug therapy. So far, a universally effective agent has not been found, and since this is a chronic, benign disorder, beginning in youth, long term drug use should be avoided. Nevertheless, if a specific IBS symptom, such as constipation or abdominal pain dominates, a specific drug may be helpful. However, tests and treatment should be minimised or even avoided in order to do no harm. A largely nonpharmaceutical approach to IBS should be taken. This approach employs drugs sparingly and then only targeted at specific and resistant symptoms.},

None of the patients or volunteers had previously undergone an intestinal intubation study. Recordings could not be obtained from four of the diabetic patients due to failure to intubate the pylorus. Catheter migration led to incomplete antral data in a further 21% of all recordings. Due to the wide variations demonstrated by the normal volunteers, parameters of either the migrating motor complex (MMC) or the fed response could not differentiate between either of the patient groups and/or the controls. Similarly, while abnormal patterns of either fasting or postprandial motility were common in the diabetic patients, manometry had a sensitivity of only 67% in comparison to the less invasive radionuclide gastric emptying study. Furthermore, manometry failed to identify any diagnostic abnormality in irritable bowel patients; in particular, the incidence of "clustered" contractions was similar in all three groups. We conclude that short duration antroduodenal manometry is of limited diagnostic usefulness due to the difficulties in pyloric intubation in the presence of a dilated stomach and the intrinsic variability in normal motor patterns, perhaps excerbated by the stressful effects of the procedure itself in tube-naive subjects.},

Most primary care physicians do not want to undertake psychosomatic treatment, but may find it necessary in refractory patients. Brief psychosomatic treatments, providing patients with betterways to cope with stress, reduce the symptoms. The literature on the psychosomatic treatment for IBS is summarized. Supportive therapy and autogenic training that produce relaxation response appear to be effective. Other special psychological therapies that require specialized training, such as hypnosis, biofeedback, cognitive therapy, transactional analysis may be used for IBS but adequately controlled trials are lacking. It is certain that psychosomatic treatment take part in the management of IBS. Additional studies are needed to verify the effectiveness of these treatment for IBS.},

Forty five subjects were studied: 10 with uncomplicated gastric ulcer, eight with uncomplicated duodenal ulcer, 18 with chronic idiopathic dyspepsia, and nine healthy asymptomatic controls. Gastrointestinal fasting and postprandial motor patterns were recorded using a low compliance perfusion technique. The interdigestive antral cumulative motility index, computed for 30 minutes before the appearance of duodenal activity fronts, and the number of activity fronts with an antral component were significantly less in patients with ulcers and those with non-ulcer dyspepsia compared with asymptomatic controls. The patient groups also had a reduced antral motor response to a solid-liquid test meal compared with healthy controls. Intestinal motor abnormalities (bursts of non-propagated phasic pressure activity and discrete clustered contractions) were recorded in a minority of patients, all with associated irritable bowel symptoms. In conclusion, antral hypomotility is a frequent but nonspecific motor abnormality in dyspepsia; abnormal motor patterns of the small bowel are less frequent and seem to be confined to patients with concomitant irritable bowel syndrome.},

Twenty-seven normal, term infants (aged 2 to 8 weeks; 14 girls) with colic, defined as crying plus fussing for more than 3 hours a day for at least 3 days of a 6-day baseline period, were enrolled. Infants were randomly assigned in 9-day periods to a sequence of placebo (Isomil formula) followed by fiber-supplemented formula (Isomil plus soy polysaccharide) (n = 12) or the reverse (n = 15). Daily diaries of crying, fussing, sleeping, formula, intake, and stooling were kept. Twenty-two infants completed three lactulose breath hydrogen tests at the end of the baseline period and after each study period. The crossover trial was followed by 30 to 35 days of use of the study formula chosen by the parents as most beneficial but unknown to the investigators. Growth was monitored throughout. Serum cholesterol, calcium, phosphate, albumin, iron, and zinc concentrations were measured at the conclusion. There were no significant differences in average daily time spent by the infants in fussing and crying during ingestion of the fiber-supplemented formula. However, parents of 18 of 27 infants chose fiber-supplemented formula as most beneficial in ameliorating symptoms of colic. While the infants were consuming fiber-supplemented formula, stool frequency increased, and breath hydrogen excretion increased significantly, in response to lactulose. Growth and serum biochemical measurements were normal in all infants. Supplementation of infant formula with the level of soy polysaccharide used in this study may have reduced crying and fussing in some infants but did not affect colicky behavior in the majority of infants, who continued to cry and fuss excessively.},

We studied eight patients with IBS and eight age-matched asymptomatic control subjects, in whom tone and motility were measured by an electronic barostat and by pneumohydraulic perfusion manometry, respectively. Tone and motility were recorded from the descending colon for a 14-hour period--3 hours awake, 7 hours asleep, 2 hours fasting after awakening, and 2 hours postprandially. In patients with IBS and in healthy subjects, colonic tone decreased by up to 50% during sleep and increased promptly on awakening. Fasting colonic tone (as quantified by the volume in the barostat balloon) in the awake state was not significantly higher in patients with IBS than it was in healthy subjects (125 +/- 13 versus 152 +/- 15 ml; P = 0.19). Tone increased postprandially in both study groups, and the increase was greater in healthy subjects than it was in patients with IBS (P < 0.05). The motility index during fasting was greater in patients with IBS than it was in healthy control subjects (3.2 +/- 0.6 versus 1.6 +/- 0.4; P = 0.05), and the postprandial increase in motility index was greater in the healthy subjects. Preprandially and postprandially, we noted a trend for high-amplitude prolonged contractions to be more frequent in patients with IBS than in healthy subjects. We conclude that colonic tone in patients with IBS showed the same nocturnal and postprandial variations as it did in healthy subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

An association between symptoms in PFM and IBS has been suggested but the frequency with which they coexist has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of each condition in groups of patients with PFM and IBS compared to normal and disease control populations. We studied four patient groups, 20 patients in each group, with PFM, IBS, inflammatory arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and also 20 normal controls. Using strict diagnostic criteria, each group was assessed by two investigators for symptoms and signs of PFM and IBS. Sigmoidoscopy was performed when indicated. Results indicate that 70% (14/20) of the PFM patients had IBS and 65% (13/20) of the IBS patients had PFM. This compared with the control groups where 12% (7/60) and 10% (6/60) had PFM and IBS respectively. In conclusion, these results indicate that PFM and IBS frequently coexist. A common pathogenetic mechanism for both conditions is therefore suggested.},

In group B otilonium bromide induced a significant improvement (p less than 0.01) of abdominal pain and distension when comparing T0 with T24. In group A diet produced an improvement, albeit not significant, of the aforementioned parameters at T24. On the basis of our data OB seems to be more effective than a high-fiber diet in the treatment of IBS.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, and diarrhea may complicate a pregnancy. Complaints of IBS and constipation may be managed by nonpharmaceutical methods. A careful history should be conducted to determine whether these complaints are of an acute or a long-standing nature. Conservative treatment of IBS is recommended and may include stool-bulking agents, a high-fiber diet, elimination of offensive foods, and the behavioral treatment of passive muscle relaxation, biofeedback or supportive psychotherapy. Constipation is generally self-limiting. It also may be treated conservatively with stool-bulking agents, increases in dietary fiber, and the addition of pelvic muscle exercises, preferably using electromyographic biofeedback. Laxatives should be used judiciously (Table 1). Diarrhea is caused most often by infectious agents in pregnancy but may also be from food poisoning or a viral disease. Infectious diarrhea may be treated by mild antidiarrheal agents and safe antibiotics. Fluid replacement is the mainstay of treatment, and care should be taken, remembering that the treatment involves two patients. These complaints can generally be managed conservatively, but persistent cases should be investigated as in a nonpregnant patient.},

   abstract = {Assessment of the physiological effects of physical and emotional stress has been hampered by a lack of suitable laboratory techniques. Since hypnosis can be used safely to induce specific emotional states of considerable intensity, we studied the effect on distal colonic motility of three hypnotically induced emotions (excitement, anger, and happiness) in 18 patients aged 20-48 years with irritable bowel syndrome. Colonic motility index was reduced by hypnosis on its own (mean change 19.1; 95% CI 0.8, 37.3; p less than 0.05) and this change was accompanied by decreases in both pulse (12; 8, 15) and respiration (6; 4, 8) rates (p less than 0.001 for both). Anger and excitement increased the colonic motility index (50.8; 29.4, 72.2; and 30.4; 8.9, 51.9, respectively; p less than 0.01 for both), pulse rate (26; 22, 30; and 28; 24, 32; p less than 0.001 for both), and respiration rate (14; 12, 16; and 12; 10, 14; p less than 0.001 for both). Happiness further reduced colonic motility although not significantly from that observed during hypnosis alone. Changes in motility were mainly due to alterations in rate than in amplitude of contractions. Our results indicate that hypnosis may help in the investigation of the effects of emotion on physiological functions; this approach could be useful outside the gastrointestinal system. Our observation that hypnosis strikingly reduces fasting colonic motility may partly explain the beneficial effects of this form of therapy in functional bowel disorders.},
