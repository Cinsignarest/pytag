   abstract = {Introduction and expression of foreign genes in bacteria often results accumulation of the foreign protein(s) in inclusion bodies (IBs). The subsequent processes of refolding are slow, difficult and often fail to yield significant amounts of folded protein. RHG1 encoded by rhg1 was a soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) transmembrane receptor-like kinase (EC 2.7.11.1) with an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain. The LRR of RHG1 was believed to be involved in elicitor recognition and interaction with other plant proteins. The aim, here, was to express the LRR domain in Escherichia coli (RHG1-LRR) and produce refolded protein. Urea titration experiments showed that the IBs formed in E. coli by the extracellular domain of the RHG1 protein could be solubilized at different urea concentrations. The RHG1 proteins were eluted with 1.0-7.0M urea in 0.5M increments. Purified RHG1 protein obtained from the 1.5 and 7.0M elutions was analyzed for secondary structure through circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Considerable secondary structure could be seen in the former, whereas the latter yielded CD curves characteristic of denatured proteins. Both elutions were subjected to refolding by slowly removing urea in the presence of arginine and reduced/oxidized glutathione. Detectable amounts of refolded protein could not be recovered from the 7.0M urea sample, whereas refolding from the 1.5M urea sample yielded 0.2mg/ml protein. The 7.0M treatment resulted in the formation of a homogenous denatured state with no apparent secondary structure. Refolding from this fully denatured state may confer kinetic and/or thermodynamic constraints on the refolding process, whereas the kinetic and/or thermodynamic barriers to attain the folded conformation appeared to be lesser, when refolding from a partially folded state.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder affecting up to 3-15% of the general population in Western countries. It is characterised by unexplained abdominal pain, discomfort and bloating in association with altered bowel habits. The pathophysiology of IBS is considered to be multifactorial, involving disturbances of the brain-gut-axis: IBS has been associated with abnormal gastrointestinal motor functions, visceral hypersensitivity, psychosocial factors, autonomic dysfunction and mucosal inflammation. Traditional IBS therapy is mainly symptom oriented and often unsatisfactory. Hence, there is a need for new treatment strategies. Increasing knowledge of brain-gut physiology, mechanisms, and neurotransmitters and receptors involved in gastrointestinal motor and sensory function have led to the development of several new therapeutic approaches. This article provides a systematic overview of recently approved or novel medications that show promise for the treatment of IBS; classification is based on the physiological systems targeted by the medication. The article includes agents acting on the serotonin receptor or serotonin transporter system, novel selective anticholinergics, alpha-adrenergic agonists, opioid agents, cholecystokinin antagonists, neurokinin antagonists, somatostatin receptor agonists, neurotrophin-3, corticotropin releasing factor antagonists, chloride channel activators, guanylate cyclase-c agonists, melatonin and atypical benzodiazepines. Finally, the role of probiotics and antibacterials in the treatment of IBS is summarised.},

With this case-control experience we wanted to determine the beneficial effect in IBS patients of a dietary integrator (IBS Active), composed of L-tryptophan, inulin, angelica, vegetal charcoal, vitamin PP, group B vitamins (B1, B2, B6) and probiotics (Lactobacillus sporogenes, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus). METHODS: The treatment group comprised 37 patients (11 men and 27 women; mean age, 44.3+/-5.1 years) given IBS Active (440 mg bid) over a mean period of 6 months (range, 5-8). The control group comprised 28 patients (6 men and 22 women; mean age, 48.6+/-3.7 years) who were instructed to continue their customary therapy for 6 months (range, 5-7). All subjects were assessed for the presence of abdominal pain and/or distension, constipation, diarrhea and alternating constipation and diarrhea. RESULTS: Compared with baseline values, the reduction in abdominal pain in the treatment group was 62% (P<0.0001), 55% (P<0.0001) in abdominal distension, 58% (P=0.05) in constipation, 33% (P=0.3) in diarrhea, and 62% (P=0.01) in alternation constipation and diarrhea. Compared with baseline values, no statistically significant reduction in symptoms was found in the control group. Post-treatment comparison between the two groups showed that the study product had reduced symptoms and that the difference was statistically significant for abdominal pain (P<0.000001), abdominal distension (P=0.003) and constipation (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The use of IBS Active led to a significant improvement in pain symptoms, abdominal distension and regulation of bowel movement in IBS patients. Further study is needed to evaluate the long-term benefit of the study product.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sensory thresholds and tone in fasting and postprandial states were evaluated with an electronic barostat in 34 patients and 10 normal controls. The pelvic floor was assessed by defaecography. RESULTS: Pain threshold to rectal distension was lower in IBS-C patients (P = 0.007). Postprandially, IBS-C patients showed lower values for sensation of gas, perception of urge, and pain threshold compared with controls. In IBS-C the anorectal angle widened less and showed less perineal mobility during defecation; the rectal tone in fasting IBS-C patients correlated with the angle at rest (P = 0.04) and with the perineal descent at rest (P = 0.01). The severity of abdominal discomfort or pain, and abdominal fullness correlated with the anorectal angle. The duration of symptoms and frequency of bowel movements correlated with perineal descent. Straining, mucus expulsion, and the feeling of incomplete evacuation correlated with rectal sensitivity variables. CONCLUSION: Patients with IBS-C have lowered sensory thresholds for noxious and non-noxious stimuli, increased visceral sensitivity after food, less perineal mobility during defecation, and symptoms that correlate with rectal sensitivity and pelvic floor parameters.},

   abstract = {Commensal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine (i.e., intestinal microflora) participate in the development and maintenance of gut sensory and motor functions, including the promotion of intestinal propulsive activity. On the other hand, intestinal motility represents one of the major control systems of gut microflora, through the sweeping of excessive bacteria from the lumen. There is emerging evidence indicating that changes in this bidirectional interplay contribute to the pathogenesis of gut diseases, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Recent interest has also been directed to the potential role of intestinal microflora in the pathogenesis of the irritable bowel syndrome. Although the status of intestinal microflora in the irritable bowel syndrome remains unsettled, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (as detected with breath testing) and increased fermentation of foods with gas production, provide indirect evidence that microflora may contribute to symptom generation in irritable bowel syndrome. The potential benefit of antibiotic and probiotic therapy is currently under investigation and opens new perspectives in irritable bowel syndrome treatment.},

We evaluated the ability of CLA and n-3 PUFA alone or in combination to modulate IBD in a pig model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. METHODS: Sixty-four, 15-day-old pigs were used to evaluate the effect of CLA, n-3 PUFA and a 50:50 mixture of CLA and n-3 PUFA on growth, clinical activity and colonic PPAR-responsive gene expression. Diets were formulated to contain: 1.33% soybean oil (control); 1.33% CLA; 1.33% fish oil; or 1.33% of a 50:50 mixture of CLA and fish oil. Intestinal inflammation was induced by an intragastric challenge with DSS on day 42 of dietary supplementation. The colonic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), PPAR gamma- and delta-responsive genes, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) were assayed by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: The onset of IBD was delayed, colitis less severe and growth suppression attenuated in pigs fed CLA, which correlated with induction of colonic PPAR gamma and its responsive gene PPAR gamma-coactivator-1alpha (PGC1-alpha) and downregulation of TNF-alpha. However, dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFA alone or in combination with CLA resulted in an early onset of disease (i.e., day 2) and faster recovery on days 6 and 7, which correlated with a marked induction of the PPAR delta-responsive gene uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3). CLA and n-3 PUFA acted synergistically to upregulate colonic KGF expression in DSS-challenged pigs but n-3 PUFA blocked CLA-induced PPAR gamma activation. CONCLUSION: Dietary CLA-supplementation upregulated colonic PPAR gamma expression and contributed to delaying the onset of experimental IBD, whereas n-3 PUFA failed to protect from IBD, although it accelerated colonic regeneration and clinical remission by activating PPAR delta.},

   abstract = {Current interest in probiotics is motivated not only by the clinical data showing efficacy of some probiotic bacteria but also by the increasing antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria (particularly in hospitals) and the rise of consumers' demand for natural substitutes of drugs. Only few randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled human trials are available, and some involved only small numbers of patients. They are difficult to compare because of differences in probiotic strains employed, doses and formulation. Among probiotic applications, reduction of diarrhea is probably the best-documented effect confirmed by recent meta-analyses. Literature on Helicobacter pylori indicates that probiotics are unable to eradicate the infection but could be useful in decreasing infection levels and as adjuvants of therapy-associated side effects. Studies performed in inflammatory bowel disease suggest that high doses of probiotics and most likely a combination of different lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are more effective in decreasing inflammatory score and maintaining patients in remission than a single probiotic strain. Probiotic studies evaluating amelioration of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome would require more sustained patient numbers. However, accumulated data is encouraging and suggests that efficacy is strain-dependent. Finally, too few probiotic intervention trials have been reported on colon cancer to allow any firm conclusion.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The symptomatic efficacy of Prescript-Assist (Safer Medical, Inc., Fort Benton, Montana), a treatment combining probiotic and prebiotic components, has previously been evaluated clinically only in an open-label study in patients with various gastrointestinal conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted primarily to compare the effects of Prescript-Assist with placebo in patients with a diagnosis of IBS. Toward this objective, a secondary methodologic goal was to determine the number and nature of symptom clusters ("subsyndromic factors") that characterize IBS. METHODS: This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in which patients were randomly assigned to receive either Prescript-Assist one 500-mg capsule BID or 1 placebo capsule BID for 2 weeks. Thirteen IBS symptoms identified from the clinical literature were embedded in a larger research instrument. Using a scale from 0 to 5, patients rated the intensity of these symptoms for the 7-day period immediately before the start of treatment, at the end of each study week, and after each of the 2 subsequent weeks (during which all patients received open-label Prescript-Assist as part of a larger study evaluating methodologic approaches to enhancing assessments of medication efficacy/safety). The symptom-intensity data were subjected to maximum likelihood factor analysis with varimax rotation to identify any IBS subsyndromic factors, and the effect of treatment on each of the identified factors was evaluated using analyses of covariance with appropriate baseline-week assessments as covariate controls. RESULTS: The study included 25 patients with IBS (23 women, 2 men; age range, 20-70 years). Three subsyndromic factors were identified that together accounted for 60.2% of total IBS symptom variance: factor 1, general ill feelings/nausea; factor 2, indigestion/flatulence; and factor 3, colitis. Treatment with Prescript-Assist was associated with significant reductions in each of the subsyndromic factors. Factor 1 was significantly reduced by 0.345 standard score units (F(1,46) = 4.26; P = 0.042), factor 2 by 0.544 standard score units (F(1,46) = 7.83; P = 0.008), and factor 3 by 0.826 standard score units (F(1,46) = 10.20; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 3 subsyndromic factors of IBS: general ill feelings/nausea, indigestion/flatulence, and colitis. In this methodologically oriented double-blind study in patients with IBS, combined probiotic-prebiotic treatment with Prescript-Assist was associated with significant reductions in these factors.},

OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the causes, diagnosis and management of IBS. DISCUSSION: Disturbed motility and sensory function underlie much of the disturbance in function that, not infrequently, begins following an episode of gastroenteritis. There is an intimate role for the brain-gut axis in modulating symptoms relating to underlying causes of small bowel bacterial overgrowth, food intolerance and sensitivity, and abnormalities of corticotropin releasing factors. Management requires long term involvement with the patient as there is no single therapeutic strategy that is predictably effective. However, diet, bulking agents, antispasmodics and a variety of alternative therapies including herbs, probiotics, and psychological intervention are important in individual patients.},

The concept of probiotics is to restore and maintain a microflora advantageous to the human body. Probiotics are found in a number of fermented dairy products, infant formula, and dietary supplements. Basic research on probiotics has suggested several modes of action beneficial for the human body and clinical research has proven its preventive and curative features in different intestinal and extraintestinal diseases. Chronic diseases cause considerable disablement in patients and represent a substantial economic burden on healthcare resources. Research has demonstrated a crucial role of nutrition in the prevention of chronic disease. Thus, positive, strain-specific effects of probiotics have been shown in diarrheal diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, and Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis, and in atopic diseases and in the prevention of cancer. As the majority of probiotics naturally inhabit the human intestinal microflora, their use has been regarded as very safe. However, in view of the range of potential benefits on health that might be achieved by the use of some probiotic bacteria, major and thorough evaluation is still necessary. In conclusion, probiotics act as an adjuvant in the prevention and treatment of a wide variety of chronic diseases.},

   abstract = {JUSTIFICATION: Yogurt has been historically used to restore gut microflora adversely affected by antibiotic treatment. Certain fermented dairy products are probiotics; "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host." Microorganisms in foods may benefit certain health conditions such as diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. A potential new probiotic from a Polynesian traditional food is poi; a starchy paste made from the corm of taro plants. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if consumption of poi, a potential non-dairy probiotic, altered the microflora in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy adults. METHODS: A cross-over clinical study included 18 subjects (19-64 years of age) divided into a poi group (n = 10) and control group (n = 8). The study duration of 14 weeks consisted of a 2-week washout, 4-week treatment or control, a subsequent 2-week washout, cross-over of 4-week treatment or control, and a final 2-week washout. Subjects thus served as their own controls. While receiving the poi treatment, participants consumed fresh poi (1-2 days old) three times a day (130 g/meal or approximately 1/2 cup/meal); the control group did not. Both groups filled out 3-day dietary records to ensure compliance. Measurable outcomes included pre- and post-treatment microbiological fecal culture analyses. RESULTS: We found no significant differences in total bacterial counts following a poi diet versus following a control diet, nor were significant differences found in counts of specific bacterial species. Lactococcus tends to be higher in poi when it is analyzed for specific bacteria, but the poi consumption in our study did not alter the mean concentration of individual bacterial species (log10 CFU/g wet feces) for Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Bifidobacterium. No significant differences in stool frequency or consistency were observed between the treatment and control group periods. CONCLUSION: Poi consumption did not significantly alter total or individual bacterial counts in the human gastrointestinal tract. Further research might determine if "sour poi" (3-4 days old) has a greater affect than "fresh poi" (1-2 days old) as a potential probiotic, and a larger trial with longer diet durations may detect more subtle effects of poi consumption on bacterial counts.},

   abstract = {The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) follows an acute, presumably infectious diarrheal illness in approximately 15% of patients. There may be a persistent, mild inflammatory state with changes in mucosal function or structure. Changes in the colonic bacterial flora reported in IBS seem related to predominant bowel. Colonic bacteria normally metabolize nutrients with the formation of gas and short chain fatty acids. The latter may induce propulsive contractions and accelerate colonic transit or they may enhance fluid and sodium absorption in the colon. This review addresses the mechanisms, rationale and current evidence for the efficacy of probiotics, including Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and VSL#3, in the treatment of IBS. The mechanisms influenced by probiotics include immune function, motility, and the intraluminal milieu. Probiotics may suppress the low-grade inflammation associated with IBS or restore normal local immune function. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria subspecies are able to deconjugate and absorb bile acids, potentially reducing the colonic mucosal secretion of mucin and fluids that may contribute to functional diarrhea or IBS with diarrhea. Therapeutic trials show the potential benefit of Bifidobacteria or Lactobacilli species alone or in the specific probiotic combination, VSL#3, on symptoms in IBS. Colonic transit was retarded in IBS patients treated with VSL#3 without induction of significant changes in bowel function. In summary, probiotics are promising therapies in IBS.},

IBS is likely to be a multifactorial condition resulting from a number of different mechanisms such as disordered motility, visceral hypersensitivity, abnormal central processing, psychological factors, genetic factors, gut inflammation, and dietary factors. Many patients with IBS give a history of adverse food reactions, but the foods identified to be relevant have been highly variable. Food hypersensitivity can be mediated by immunoglobulin E-dependent and -independent mechanisms involving mast cells, eosinophils, and other immune cells. Recent clinical and experimental studies suggest that there is a possible role for food hypersensitivity in IBS, with improvement of IBS symptom severity in a subset of patients on elimination diets, but the underlying mechanisms in IBS have yet to be fully understood. This review considers the evidence for the role of food hypersensitivity in IBS, based on the available epidemiologic and pathophysiologic data, and the clinical implications.},

To date, few studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of probiotic administration in patients with constipation-variant IBS. A new agent recently available in clinical practice is a symbiotic consisting of a probiotic, Bifidobacterium longum W11, and the short chain oligosaccharide prebiotic Fos Actilight. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this symbiotic in patients with constipation-variant IBS. METHODS: A total of 636 patients (250 men, 386 women) diagnosed with constipation-type IBS according to the Roma II criteria were enrolled in 43 centers and received the symbiotic at a dose of 3 g/die for at least 36 days. A validated questionnaire investigating symptoms and stool frequency was administered before and after treatment. RESULTS: Based on patient responses to visual scale items, frequency increased significantly after treatment in the ''no symptom'' class from 3% to 26.7% for bloating and from 8.4% to 44.1% for abdominal pain (P<0.0001). In the more severe symptoms classes (moderate-severe), symptom frequency dropped significantly from 62.9% to 9.6% and from 38.8% to 4.1% for bloating and abdominal pain, respectively. Stool frequency significantly increased from 2.9+/-1.6 times/week to 4.1+/-1.6 times/ week. CONCLUSIONS: The study product can increase stool frequency in patients with constipation-variant IBS and reduce abdominal pain and bloating in those with moderate-severe symptoms.},

   abstract = {IBS is a common condition, affecting approximately 3% to 15% of the general population based on various diagnostic criteria. There seem to be differences in disease epidemiology between the eastern and the western world. As data from larger Asian epidemiological studies begin to surface,however, such differences appear to be less marked. The proportion of IBS patients who consult a physician for their symptoms is around 50%. Psychological factors and the presence and duration of abdominal pain are all significant predictors for health care seeking. The natural history of IBS is characterized by frequent fluctuation of symptoms and by an overlap with other functional GI disorders, some of which share a number of risk factors for IBS. Unnecessary abdominal surgery is performed in a high proportion of IBS sufferers. Along with the established role for psychosocial conditions in IBS, other risk factors are emerging. Evidence for postinfectious IBS is mounting, but the clinical usefulness of characterizing such patients remains unclear. Food sensitivities are frequently present in IBS, but more well-conducted trials of avoidance diets and desensitization are needed. Finally,genetic markers in IBS are an increasing focus of attention, but the amount of phenotypic variance explained by genetic variability remains to be established.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary nucleotide supplementation has been shown to have important effects on the growth and development of cells which have a rapid turnover such as those in the immune system and the gastrointestinal tract. Work with infants has shown that the incidence and duration of diarrhoea is lower when nucleotide supplementation is given, and animal work shows that villi height and crypt depth in the intestine is increased as a result of dietary nucleotides. Dietary nucleotides may be semi-essential under conditions of ill-health, poor diet or stress. Since people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome tend to fulfil these conditions, we tested the hypothesis that symptoms would be improved with dietary nucleotide supplementation. METHODS: Thirty-seven people with a diagnosis of Irritable Bowel gave daily symptom severity ratings for abdominal pain, diarrhoea, urgency to have a bowel movement, incomplete feeling of evacuation after a bowel movement, bloating, flatulence and constipation for 28 days (baseline). They were then assigned to either placebo (56 days) followed by experimental (56 days) or the reverse. There was a four week washout period before crossover. During the placebo and experimental conditions participants took one 500 mg capsule three times a day; in the experimental condition the capsule contained the nutroceutical substances. Symptom severity ratings and psychological measures (anxiety, depression, illness intrusiveness and general health) were obtained and analysed by repeated measures ANOVAs. RESULTS: Symptom severity for all symptoms (except constipation) were in the expected direction of baseline>placebo>experimental condition. Symptom improvement was in the range 4 - 6%. A feeling of incomplete evacuation and abdominal pain showed the most improvement. The differences between conditions for diarrhoea, bloating and flatulence were not significant at the p < .05 level. There were no significant differences between the conditions for any of the psychological measures. CONCLUSION: Dietary nucleotide supplementation improves some of the symptoms of irritable bowel above baseline and placebo level. As expected, placebo effects were high. Apart from abdominal pain and urgency to have a bowel movement, the improvements, while consistent, are modest, and were not accompanied by improvements in any of the psychological measures. We suggest that the percentage improvement over and above the placebo effect is a physiological effect of the nucleotide supplement on the gut. The mechanisms by which these effects might improve symptoms are discussed.},

Gastroenteritis or antibiotic therapy may damage the colonic microflora, leading to increased fermentation and the accumulation of gas. Gas excretion may be measured by whole-body calorimetry but there has only been one such study on IBS to date. We aimed to assess the relationship between IBS symptoms and fermentation rates in IBS. A purpose-built, 1.4-m3, whole-body calorimeter was used to assess excretion of H2 and CH4 in IBS subjects while consuming a standard diet and, again, after open randomization on either the standard diet together with the antibiotic metronidazole or a fiber-free diet to reduce fermentation. Metronidazole significantly reduced the 24-hr excretion of hydrogen (median value compared to the control group, 397 vs 230 ml/24 hr) and total gas (H2 + CH4; 671 vs 422 ml/min) and the maximum rate of gas excretion (1.6 vs 0.8 ml/min), as did a no-fiber polymeric diet (hydrogen, 418 vs 176 ml/min; total gas, 564 vs 205 ml/min; maximum rate of gas excretion, 1.35 vs 0.45 ml/min), with a significant improvement in abdominal symptoms. IBS may be associated with rapid excretion of gaseous products of fermentation, whose reduction may improve symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is based on arbitrary criteria due to the lack of an accurate diagnostic test. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether rectosigmoid tone modification after a meal represents an accurate diagnostic approach. METHODS: In a secondary care setting, 32 constipation predominant and 24 diarrhoea predominant IBS patients, 10 functional diarrhoea and 10 functional constipation patients, 29 organic gastrointestinal disease patients, and 10 healthy volunteers underwent a rectal barostat test to measure fasting and postprandial rectosigmoid tone. Rectosigmoid response was assessed following three meals containing different amounts of calories: 200 kcal, 400 kcal and 1000 kcal. RESULTS: After 200 kcal, healthy volunteers and patients with organic diseases showed a reduction in rectosigmoid volume of at least 28% of fasting volume, indicating a meal induced increase in muscle tone. In contrast, patients with diarrhoea predominant IBS showed dilation of the rectosigmoid colon, indicative of reduced tone, and patients with constipation predominant IBS showed a mild volume reduction or no modification. Functional diarrhoea and constipation patients showed rectosigmoid tone modification resembling that of the corresponding IBS subtype. A 400 kcal meal normalised rectosigmoid tone in more than half of the constipation predominant IBS patients but none of the diarrhoea predominant IBS patients. In contrast, a 1000 kcal meal normalised tone response in all IBS patients. Sensitivity of the test was 100%, specificity 93%, positive predictive value 96%, and negative predictive value 100%. CONCLUSION: A postprandial reduction in rectosigmoid tone of at least 28% of fasting value after a low caloric meal accurately separates organic and functional gastrointestinal disease patients. This parameter may therefore be used in the positive diagnosis of IBS.},

METHODS: This study was a stratified, randomized study by clustering samples, which involved 5403 students whose age range was 6 to 18 years from 9 schools, and was conducted in Heilongjiang Province and Shanghai. All students studied were requested to fill in a questionnaire. IBS was diagnosed according to Rome II criteria. RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS according to Rome II criteria in adolescents and children in China was 13.25%. The ratio of boys to girls was 1:1.8. There was a higher prevalence (14.02%) of IBS in Heilongjiang province than that (11.72%) in Shanghai. The prevalence in children 12 years and younger was not statistically significantly higher than that of adolescents 13 years and older (11.86% and 11.44%, respectively). The prevalence of IBS in minority students (21.15%) was not statistically significantly higher than that in Han race students (16.08%). Our study indicated that psychological factors, food habit, bad exterior environment, personal habits, and family conditions might be important contributing factors, and exposure to coldness (odds ratio: 2.83) is most prominent. CONCLUSION: IBS was a common disorder in adolescents and children in China. The prevalence of IBS in adolescents and children was different in different geographic areas. Our study indicated that IBS in adolescents and children might have possible relations with psychological factors, food habit, bad exterior environment, and family condition.},

Probiotics exert their benefits through several mechanisms; they prevent colonization, cellular adhesion and invasion by pathogenic organisms, they have direct antimicrobial activity and they modulate the host immune response. The strongest evidence for the clinical effectiveness of probiotics has been in their use for the prevention of symptoms of lactose intolerance, treatment of acute diarrhea, attenuation of antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal side effects and the prevention and treatment of allergy manifestations. More research needs to be carried out to clarify conflicting findings on the use of probiotics for prevention of travelers' diarrhea, infections in children in daycare and dental caries, and elimination of nasal colonization with potentially pathogenic bacteria. Promising ongoing research is being conducted on the use of probiotics for the treatment of Clostridium difficile colitis, treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and prevention of relapse, treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, treatment of intestinal inflammation in cystic fibrosis patients, and prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants. Finally, areas of future research include the use of probiotics for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, prevention of cancer and the treatment of graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplant recipients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In Irritable Bowel Syndrome, the gut-associated immune system may be up-regulated resulting in immune complex production, low-grade inflammation, loss of Class I bacteria, and translocation of inflammatory mediators and macromolecules outside of the GI lumen. Since food intolerance may be one of the reasons for this upregulation, our goal was to investigate the role of food intolerance in IBS patients. METHODS: In this open label pilot study, we enrolled 20 patients with IBS by Rome II criteria (15 women, ages 24-81) who had failed standard medical therapies in a tertiary care GI clinic. Baseline serum IgE and IgG food and mold panels, and comprehensive stool analysis (CSA) were performed. Breath-hydrogen testing and IBS Quality-of-Life (QOL) questionnaires were obtained. Patients underwent food elimination diets based on the results of food and mold panels followed by controlled food challenge. Probiotics were also introduced. Repeat testing was performed at 6-months. We followed up with this cohort at 1 year after trial completion to assess the reported intervention and for placebo effect. RESULTS: Baseline abnormalities were identified on serum IgG food and mold panels in 100% of the study subjects with significant improvement after food elimination and rotation diet (p < 0.05). Significant improvements were seen in stool frequency (p < 0.05), pain (p < 0.05), and IBS-QOL scores (p < 0.0001). Imbalances of beneficial flora and dysbiotic flora were identified in 100% of subjects by CSA. There was a trend to improvement of beneficial flora after treatment but no change in dysbiotic flora. The 1-year follow up demonstrated significant continued adherence to the food rotation diet (4.00 +/- 1.45), minimal symptomatic problems with IBS (4.00 +/- 1.17), and perception of control over IBS (4.15 +/- 1.23). The continued use of probiotics was considered less helpful (3.40 +/- 1.60). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that identifying and appropriately addressing food sensitivity in IBS patients not previously responding to standard therapy results in a sustained clinical response and impacts on overall well being and quality of life in this challenging entity.},

Bacterial enteropathogens from ingested food are the primary causes.

Diarrhea is associated with a disability of 24 hours per episode, interfering with travel plans and, of even greater concern, post-diarrhea irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) occurs in up to 10% of patients. The use of rifaximin, a poorly absorbed drug, is likely to become common as an attempt to prevent diarrhea and post-infectious IBS. All travelers to high-risk areas should take with them an effective antibacterial drug (rifaximin, fluoroquinolones, or azithromycin) for self-treatment of diarrhea occurring during travel.

   abstract = {The use of preventive measures and self-treatment for travelers' diarrhea is routine in regions where the occurrence of diarrhea is predictably high. People traveling to these areas who do not exercise care in their selection of consumed foods and beverages will suffer high rates of illness. Such diarrhea normally affects the traveler for a day, although it can result in chronic postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. Although systemic antibacterial drugs are effective in preventing diarrhea, their use is not routinely recommended because of side effects and their importance as a therapy for extra-intestinal infections. This review focuses on current and future uses of antibacterial drugs in the prevention and therapy of travelers' diarrhea. Minimally absorbed (< 0.4%) rifaximin can effectively reduce the occurrence of travelers' diarrhea without side effects. Bismuth subsalicylate is a useful alternative, although it is less effective than rifaximin for the prevention of travelers' diarrhea and the required doses are less convenient. All people who travel to high-risk areas should take curative antimicrobial agents with them for self-treatment of illness: rifaximin 200 mg three times a day for 3 days, or an absorbable agent such as a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin taken in a single dose initially, with the need for a second or third dose determined by clinical response. Loperamide (up to 8 mg per day for < or = 2 days) can be given with the antibiotic to offer rapid symptomatic improvement. In the future, the ability to evaluate the genetic risk of illness acquisition might allow person-specific recommendations to be made.},

   abstract = {Travellers' diarrhoea remains a major public health problem, contributing to significant morbidity and disability. Because bacterial enteropathogens cause a majority of this form of diarrhoea, antibacterial drugs are effective when used in chemoprophylaxis or for empirical treatment.A review of the MEDLINE listings for travellers' diarrhoea for the past 4 years was conducted; a library of >1,000 scientific articles on the topic was also considered in developing this review. Persons who travel from industrialised countries to developing countries of the tropical and semi-tropical world are the individuals who experience travellers' diarrhoea. While diarrhoea occurs with reduced frequency among persons travelling to low-risk areas from other low- or other high-risk areas, and there remain areas of intermediate risk, this review looks primarily at the illness occurring in persons from industrialised regions visiting high-risk regions of Latin America, Africa and Southern Asia. The material reviewed deals with the high frequency of acquiring diarrhoea during international travel to high-risk areas, seen in approximately 40%, and the expected bacterial causes of illness, of which diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli is the most important. The host risk factors associated with increased susceptibility to diarrhoea include young age, lack of previous travel to high-risk regions in the past 6 months, indiscriminate food and beverage selection patterns, and host genetics. It appears feasible to decrease the rate of illness among the travelling public by careful food and beverage selection or through chemoprophylaxis with nonabsorbed rifaximin. Chemoprophylaxis with rifaximin should help to reduce the occurrence of travellers' diarrhoea and hopefully prevent post-diarrhoea complications, including irritable bowel syndrome. Early empirical therapy with antibacterial drugs, including rifaximin, a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin, will decrease the duration of illness and return travellers more quickly to their planned activities.With collaboration between local governments and public health researchers, it may be possible to improve hygiene in areas to be visited, which may translate into reduced rates of illness. More liberal use of rifaximin prophylaxis is likely to reduce the occurrence of illness and complications of disease. Vaccines and immunoprophylactic products may be beneficial for prevention of a subset of individuals otherwise developing diarrhoea.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The determinants of the placebo effect are not well established. Goal of this study was to explore likely predictive factors in an already published data set. METHODS: We re-analysed data from a study in 120 patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that were randomly assigned to three arms of the study to receive (double-blind) either a drug (mebeverin) (n = 40) or placebo (n = 40), or (in an open trial) dietary treatment (fibre) (n = 40) for up to 16 week. Treatment was conducted by 3 different doctors (A, B, C) with 44, 27, and 18 patients, resp. A fourth group (n = 31) was treated by different varying physicians. Symptoms were assessed every 4 weeks, and the degree of patient compliance and the number of drop-outs, the number of patients improved/not improved (in %), symptom severity (Kruis Score) at enrolment, and age and gender as covariates were included into the analysis. RESULTS: Drop-out rate was 30 % for placebo, 30 % for mebeverin, and 15 % for the diet. For the patients remaining in the study, average compliance was 75 % with placebo, but 89 % for the drug and 82 % for the diet. Response rates were 39 % for placebo, but 20 % for the drug; response rate for the diet (open trial) was 43 % under all doctors. Response rates for drug and placebo combined were 32 % for doctor A (female,43 years), but 19 % for doctors B and C together (both males, 32 and 40 years)); this effect was not significant. Placebo responders were more often women (47 %) than men (28 %), while age effects were only found with dietary treatment: responders were younger. Placebo responders had an overall lower Kruis Score than non-responders (45 vs 52 points), but this was also true for drug (52 vs. 62 points) and diet responders (56 vs 68 points). CONCLUSION: The major factors contributing to the placebo response are the treating physician (gender, training), and the patients gender (female). Patients with lower Kruis score (more likely non-functionally disordered) may be prone to higher (placebo) response rates.},

   abstract = {Functional dyspepsia (FD) refers to unexplained pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen and is commonly seen in gastroenterology practice. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with FD are unclear, although traditionally, delayed gastric emptying, visceral hypersensitivity to acid or mechanical distention, and impaired gastric accommodation have been implicated as putative physiologic disturbances. It also remains uncertain whether FD and irritable bowel syndrome are different presentations of the same disorder. Recent data on pathophysiologic mechanisms of FD have focused on postprandial motor disturbances (accelerated gastric emptying, antral-fundic incoordination, and abnormal phasic contractions), alterations of neurohormonal mechanisms in response to a meal, and previous acute infection. Pharmacologic therapies for FD may be guided by these novel mechanisms, as current available therapeutic options are limited. Novel prokinetics and gastric accommodation modulators, visceral analgesics, and agents targeting the neurohormonal response to food ingestion are the next therapeutic frontiers in FD. This review summarizes traditional knowledge and more recent advances in the pathophysiology of FD and potential therapeutic opportunities.},

METHODS: Eighty-five patients [male 32, female 53; age (45.31+/-11.72) years] were given live combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus capsules 1260 mg/d t.i.d.x4 weeks. Syndrome scales were used to evaluate the efficacy in gastrointestinal syndrome. Fecal flora was also measured before and after the treatment. Six bacteria were cultured and the colony forming units were counted in stool. SPSS was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients finished the follow-up. No side-effect was found. For treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, the effective rate of live combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus capsules was 56.8% in the second week, 74.3% in the fourth week and 73.0% in the sixth week. Single symptom was improved, especially in abdominal pain and stool character. The probiotica containing live combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus could increase bifidobacterium count (P<0.01) and lactobacillus count (P<0.05); decrease bacteroides count (P<0.05) and enterococci count (P<0.01); No obvious changes were observed in clostridium difficile colonitis and enterobacteriaceae (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The result of the study indicated that the administration of live combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus improved the symptom of irritable bowel syndrome and that there was a gradual increase of this effect. Thereafter conditions remained stable for 2 weeks. That improvement may be associated with alterations in gastrointestinal flora.},

AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of rifaximine alone or in association with the probiotic strain of Bifidobacterium longum W11 in reducing symptoms in patients with IBS. METHODS: We performed a monocentric, prospective, randomized open trial including 70 patients randomized in to two groups: Group A (41 patients) receiving rifaximin 200 (2 cp bid for ten days in a month) followed by a formulation of the probiotic strain of Bifidobacterium longum W11(one granulated suspension for 6 days on alternate weeks ) and Group B (29 patients) receiving only rifaximin 200 (2 cp bid for ten days in a month). The clinical evaluation was performed at admission and after 2-months, taking into account the method of visual analogous. RESULTS: At the 2-month follow-up, Group A patients reported a greater improvement of symptoms compared to patients in group B (p = 0.010) even if the physician's opinion at T1 did not confirm these results (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: The increased colonisation by Bifi-dobacterium longum W11, after the cyclic administration of rifaximin, which eradicates the bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine, may reduce symptoms, especially those related to bowel habit and stool frequency in patients with IBS. The abnormalities observed in the colonic flora of IBS suggest, in fact, that a probiotic approach will ultimately be justified.},

On the other hand, the presence of clinically important abdominal discomfort or pain associated with constipation defines irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation. Intake of dietary fibre and bulking agents (psyllium) may be effective in alleviating chronic constipation in patients without slow colonic transit or disordered constipation. On the other hand, fibre may improve stool consistency in patients with IBS with constipation, but it is considered to be not effective in improving abdominal pain, distension or bloating. Probiotics may be effective in relieving constipation; however, the effect of lactic acid bacteria ingestion may be dependent on the bacterial strain used and the population being studied. Lactulose, which is a substrate for lactic acid bacteria (prebiotic), is effective to treat patients with chronic constipation.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and irritable bowel syndrome are chronic, debilitating gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. There are no known causes of inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome. Both of these GI conditions significantly impair quality of life and the ability to complete activities of daily living. Unfortunately, there has been little education and research surrounding the evaluation of effective coping strategies with respect to GI disorders, particularly from the perspective of those diagnosed. As such, exploring the strategies of individuals with GI disorders would provide information concerning coping strategies from the perspective of those afflicted. PURPOSE: The overall objective of this research was to explore the lived experience of women who had been diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome. This article specifically explores the relationship between food and irritable bowel syndrome and/or inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Eight females, diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome, were recruited via on-campus posters from a university in southern Ontario, Canada. Qualitative information was collected in the form of background questionnaires, e-mail interviews, and face-to-face interviews, which were subsequently analyzed for trends. RESULTS: Every woman reported that one of the most significant means by which to cope with their condition centered around food consumption or controlling their food consumption. Subjects identified the importance of determining their "trigger foods," selecting healthy food choices, the impact of stress, and problems associated with food and travel. CONCLUSIONS: This research, predicated on the narratives of women diagnosed with GI disorders, substantiates the profound effect that food has on conditions of the GI tract. All of the women identified their relationship with food as a dynamic learning process, one that they thought would be a lifelong struggle. The implications for community health nurses in assisting individuals with GI disorders are discussed.},

   abstract = {GOAL: The goal of this report is to review the use of dietary intake and probiotics in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in published reports. BACKGROUND: Dietary factors can be important in inducing symptoms that occur in patients with the IBS. Dietary intolerances, dietary allergies, specific food metabolites, and regular diet contents all may act as triggers and aggravate the symptoms of IBS; but when any of these mechanisms can be proven to cause the symptoms, then their elimination results in the resolution of that patient's IBS. METHODS: Our previous review was updated. In addition, a careful Medline search was made for the years from 1975 to 2004 to evaluate human research reports on diet and probiotics in the IBS. Forty-six manuscripts were reviewed on diet and six were available on probiotic use in IBS. The most common dietary factor evaluated in the literature was bran, and the most common probiotic used was Lactobacillus plantarum. CONCLUSIONS: Although investigations have shown that bran may be helpful in some patients, a complete review of the literature does not reveal conclusive evidence that diet therapy is effective in IBS. From the limited reports on probiotics, there appears to be a trend to decreasing symptoms. It is clear that much more prospective research is needed to study both dietary factors and probiotics in these areas.},

It is the recommendation that they may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of acute diarrhea in adults and children, the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults and children, and the maintenance of remission and prevention of pouchitis. Although early results indicate that probiotics may also be useful in immunologic modulation to prevent atopy, treatment of radiation intestinal disease, vaginosis, ulcerative colitis, and the irritable bowel syndrome, the studies available are not sufficient to say they are definitely helpful. Even fewer data are available to recommend probiotics for the treatment of H pylori and Crohn disease and for the prevention of cardiovascular risk factors or other degenerative diseases. Clearly, larger and better-designed studies of probiotics are necessary, including comparative and dose-ranging trials.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the world's most common gastrointestinal functional disorder and is associated with several social and economic costs. Health-related quality of life is often impaired in patients with IBS. The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying IBS remain poorly defined. The therapeutic approach to patients with IBS is based on symptoms, and fibers may play an important role in treatment. Among the various types of fiber, water-soluble, non-gelling fibers seem to be a promising option for treatment of IBS. Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a water-soluble, non-gelling fiber that has provided therapeutic benefits. In clinical trials, PHGG decreased symptoms in constipation-predominant and diarrhea-predominant forms of IBS and decreased abdominal pain. Further, an improvement in quality of life was observed in patients with IBS during and after treatment with PHGG. Moreover, PHGG seems to have prebiotic properties because it increases the colonic contents of short-chain fatty acids, Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacteria.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased numbers of mast cells and mast cell activation in distal gut segments are associated with symptom onset and severity in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although upper gut symptoms are common, mast cells have not been thoroughly evaluated in proximal gut in IBS patients. METHODS: Jejunal biopsies obtained by Watson's capsule, aspiration of intestinal fluid and one blood sample were obtained in 20 diarrhoea-predominant patients with IBS (D-IBS) and 14 healthy volunteers (H). Psychological stress (Holmes-Rahe Scale) and depression (Beck's Depression Inventory) were evaluated at baseline and food and respiratory allergy excluded. Biopsies were processed for H&E staining and microscopic inflammation assessed by counting intraepithelial lymphocytes. Mast cells in lamina propria were counted by immunohistochemistry with CD117 (c-kit). Tryptase concentration was measured in intestinal fluid and serum. RESULTS: D-IBS patients showed higher psychological stress than healthy volunteers (D-IBS: 203 (SD 114) v H: 112 (SD 99); p = 0.019). Immunohistochemical staining of jejunal mucosa revealed mild increase in intraepithelial CD3+ cells in D-IBS patients (D-IBS: 15.3 (SD 5.5; 95% CI 12.7 to 17.9) v H: 10.3 (SD 3.9; 95% CI 8.0 to 12.5); p = 0.006). Moreover, D-IBS patients showed marked increase in mast cells numbers (D-IBS: 34 (SD 9.3); H: 15.3 (SD 4.4) mast cells/hpf; p<0.001) and higher tryptase concentration in jejunal fluid (D-IBS: 0.45 (SD 0.38); H: 0.09 (SD 0.10) microg/l; p = 0.005).

The authors present a brief description of the normal microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract, discuss probiotics in the aspects of gut immunity and then move to selection of bacterial strains as probiotics. The main issue raised is the critical evaluation of probiotics in randomized clinical trials for conditions such as: infectious diarrhoea; antibiotic associated diarrhoea; inflammatory bowel disease; pouchitis and diverticulitis; H. pylori infection; irritable bowel syndrome. Safety of probiotics is mentioned with respect to susceptible individuals and bacterial translocation. As a conclusion the authors again recall the strain specific actions of probiotics in different clinical situations and that so far probiotics play a role in rotaviral and post antibiotic diarrhoea and pouchitis. An important issue still to be solved in order to confidently recommend probiotics as efficacious therapy is the regulatory aspect of probiotics.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medical therapies and practices are widely employed in the treatment of the irritable bowel syndrome. AIM: To review the usage of complementary and alternative medicine in the irritable bowel syndrome, and to assess critically the basis and evidence for its use. METHODS: A systematic review of complementary and alternative medical therapies and practices in the irritable bowel syndrome was performed based on literature obtained through a Medline search. RESULTS: A wide variety of complementary and alternative medical practices and therapies are commonly employed by irritable bowel syndrome patients both in conjunction with and in lieu of conventional therapies. As many of these therapies have not been subjected to controlled clinical trials, some, at least, of their efficacy may reflect the high-placebo response rate that is characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome. Of those that have been subjected to clinical trials most have involved small poor quality studies. There is, however, evidence to support efficacy for hypnotherapy, some forms of herbal therapy and certain probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors caring for irritable bowel syndrome patients need to recognize the near ubiquity of complementary and alternative medical use among this population and the basis for its use. All complementary and alternative medicine is not the same and some, such as hypnotherapy, forms of herbal therapy, specific diets and probiotics, may well have efficacy in irritable bowel syndrome. Above all, we need more science and more controlled studies; the absence of truly randomized placebo-controlled trials for many of these therapies has limited meaningful progress in this area.},

However, the antidepressant-like activity of Koso-san has never been evaluated scientifically. In this study, ddY mice subjected to a combination of forced swimming and chronic mild stresses were termed depression-like model mice. The degree of the depression-like state was measured by the animal's duration of immobility using the forced swimming test (FST). Oral administration of Koso-san (1.0 g/kg/body wt./day, 9 days) significantly shortened the duration of immobility of the depression-like model mice in the FST; however, locomotor activity was not affected. Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays an important role in the pathophysiology of depression. Levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA expression in the hypothalamus and proopiomelanocortin mRNA expression in the pituitary were significantly increased, and glucocorticoid receptor protein expression in the hypothalamus paraventricular nucleus was downregulated in the depression-like model mice. However, Koso-san ameliorated these alterations to the normal conditions. The results of this study suggest that Koso-san shows the antidepressant-like effect through suppressing the hyperactivity of the HPA axis in depression-like model mice.},

RESULTS: SPT results were different among the three groups in which SPT was positive in 17 (38.6%) treated patients, in 5 (16.1%) untreated patients and in 1 (3.3%) control (P<0.01). The number of positive SPTs was greater in the IBS group than in the control group (P<0.001). The number of positive food SPTs was higher in the treated IBS group than in the untreated IBS group (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Positive food SPT is higher in IBS patients than in controls.},

AIM: To investigate whether a probiotic mixture containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus LC705, Bifidobacterium breve Bb99 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS is effective in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. METHODS: A total of 103 patients fulfilling the Rome I or II criteria took part in this 6-month, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The patients received a probiotic capsule or a placebo capsule daily. Gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habits were recorded. RESULTS: At the end the total symptom score (abdominal pain + distension + flatulence + borborygmi) was 7.7 (95% CI: -13.9 to -1.6) points lower in the probiotic group (P = 0.015). This represents a median reduction of 42% in the symptom score of the probiotic group compared with 6% in the placebo group. In individual symptoms, borborygmi was milder in the probiotic group (P = 0.008), and for the rest of the symptoms there was a non-significant trend. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that this probiotic mixture is effective in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Considering the high prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome and the lack of effective therapies, even a slight reduction in symptoms could have positive public health consequences.},

Recent clinical trials suggest beneficial effects of certain probiotics in IBS. Because of the heterogeneity of IBS a probiotic combination may be more efficient than a single strain. We screened for optimal strains, and developed a multispecies probiotic combination consisting of L. rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, P. freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS and Bifidobacterium breve Bb99. The clinical efficacy of the probiotic combination was evaluated in IBS patients in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled six-month intervention. During six months the subjects received daily either probiotic supplementation or placebo. IBS symptoms were followed by symptom diaries. The probiotic supplementation demonstrated significant value in reducing IBS symptoms. At the end of the study period the total symptom score (abdominal pain + distension + flatulence + rumbling) had reduced with 42% in probiotic group versus 6% for instance anti-inflammatory effects, balancing of the microbiota or motility-related effects induced by the probiotic. The probiotic activity may be enhanced by synergistic effects of the combination that each strain alone would not hold. In conclusion, we found a probiotic combination of LGG and three other strains to be effective in alleviating IBS symptoms.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome is a common and likely a multifactorial gastrointestinal disorder in which a disturbed brain-gut axis has been thought to have a mandatory role. Recent clinical and experimental studies imply that dietary factors may be more important in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome than was earlier anticipated. The purpose of this review is to present those studies and discuss their findings in relation to the crosstalk between the gastrointestinal immune and nervous systems. RECENT FINDINGS: Food elimination based on serum immunoglobulin G antibodies in irritable bowel syndrome has been found to result in a significant decrease in symptoms, compared with diets in which dietary restrictions are not guided by those antibodies. Both numbers of mast cells and their mediators have been shown to be increased in intestinal mucosa in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, especially in the close proximity of intestinal nerves. Animal studies have demonstrated that this increase in intestinal mast cell density could be a consequence of local hypersensitivity to food antigens. That kind of local gastrointestinal hypersensitivity seems to be beyond the reach of current diagnostic methods available in clinical practice. SUMMARY: Dietary factors may significantly contribute to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome. Elimination diets based on the detection of local food hypersensitivity may offer a treatment option for irritable bowel syndrome patients in the future.},

Psychotherapy, which has been reported on in previous studies, is available only in specific centers. We describe in this study a novel and simple psychotherapy; that is, the fasting therapy (FT) for treatment of patients with IBS. Of 84 inpatients with IBS, 58 patients who still had moderate to severe IBS symptoms after 4-week basic treatment were investigated retrospectively. Of the 58 patients enrolled in this study, 36 underwent FT, whereas the remaining 22 received a consecutive basic treatment (control therapy). There were no significant differences in the 4-point severity scales of gastrointestinal and psychological symptoms between the 2 groups before the start of FT. The basic treatment consisted of pharmacotherapy and brief psychotherapy, whereas the FT consisted of 10 days of starvation followed by 5 days of refeeding. Changes in scores of symptoms before and after each treatment were analyzed. FT significantly improved 7 out of the 10 symptoms assessed; that is, abdominal pain-discomfort (p < .001), abdominal distension (p < .001), diarrhea (p < .001), anorexia (p = .02), nausea (p < .01), anxiety (p < .001), and interference with life in general (p < .001). However, the control therapy significantly improved only 3 out of the 10 symptoms assessed; that is, abdominal pain-discomfort (p = .03), abdominal distension (p < .01), and interference with life (p = .01). Our results suggest that FT may have beneficial effects on intractable patients with IBS.},

METHODS: Forty-eight patients with Rome II IBS were randomized in a parallel group, double-blind design to placebo or VSL# 3 twice daily (31 patients received 4 weeks and 17 patients 8 weeks of treatment). Pre- and post-treatment colonic transit measurements were performed using scintigraphy with (111)In charcoal. Symptoms were summarized as an average daily score for the entire period of treatment and separately for the first 4 weeks of treatment. Weekly satisfactory relief of abdominal bloating was assessed. RESULTS: Treatment with VSL# 3 was associated with reduced flatulence over the entire treatment period (placebo 39.5 +/- 2.6 vs VSL# 3 29.7 +/- 2.6, P = 0.011); similarly, during the first 4 weeks of treatment, flatulence scores were reduced (placebo 40.1 +/- 2.5 vs VSL# 3 30.8 +/- 2.5, P = 0.014). Proportions of responders for satisfactory relief of bloating, stool-related symptoms, abdominal pain and bloating scores were not different. Colonic transit was retarded with VSL# 3 relative to placebo (colon geometric center 2.27 +/- 0.20 vs 2.83 +/- 0.19, P = 0.05 respectively). CONCLUSION: VSL# 3 reduces flatulence scores and retards colonic transit without altering bowel function in patients with IBS and bloating.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal (GI) tract disorder that has heterogeneous clinical presentations such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal distension. It is known that several mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of IBS. Probiotics may target one or more pathophysiologic pathways in IBS and may improve the symptoms of IBS. However, the results of studies about probiotics on IBS are controversial. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of probiotics on GI symptoms and intestinal gas volume changes in patients with IBS. METHODS: Forty patients were randomly allocated to be treated with Medilac DS (Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus faecium) (n=20) or placebo (n=20) in a double-blind, prospective manner. The change in intestinal gas volume and symptom scores after 4-week treatment were evaluated for the efficacy. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in bloating, frequency of gas expulsion, frequency of defecation, and hardness of stool before and after the treatment. However, the severity of abdominal pain and the frequency of abdominal pain decreased significantly in Medilac DS group (2.4+/-1.3 cm/day --> 1.6+/-1.6 cm/day, 1.7+/-1.3/day --> 1.0+/-1.0/day) (p=0.044, p=0.038), but not in placebo group (2.1+/-2.0 cm/day --> 1.8+/-2.1 cm/day, 1.3+/-1.2/day --> 1.4+/-1.9/day). In both groups, intestinal gas volume at baseline, after 2-week treatment, and after 4-week treatment did not show significant change. Medilac DS was well tolerated without adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Medilac DS is a safe and useful probiotic agent for the treatment of abdominal pain in patients with IBS.},

BACKGROUND: The public awareness and usage of CAM have increased. The use of CAM has been described in patients with functional bowel disorders; however, their role in patients with gastrointestinal disease is less clear. STUDY: Patients attending luminal gastroenterology clinics and customers at local supermarkets completed a 30-point, structured questionnaire assessing their use of CAM. RESULTS: A total of 1,409 subjects were recruited. The incidence of CAM use was 49.5% for inflammatory bowel disease, 50.9% for irritable bowel syndrome, 20% for general gastrointestinal diseases, and 27% for controls. Pearson's chi(2) tests showed that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or irritable bowel syndrome were more likely to use CAM than controls (P < 0.001). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that females were more likely to take CAM than men (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of CAM users among patients with IBD is similar to those with a functional diagnosis. Increasing numbers of IBD patients are using CAM in addition to conventional therapy. Awareness of this may prevent adverse CAM and conventional drug interactions.},

Despite more than 50 years of research providing information about the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease, the rate of illness and consequences remain unchanged. An estimated 40% of travelers to developing nations will become ill with diarrhea. Although travelers' diarrhea is considered a self-limited disease, novel and effective approaches to disease prevention and treatment have been realized in recent years. Also, recent evidence has identified a potential for long-term complications of the illness, including postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. With the advent of poorly absorbed (<0.4%) rifaximin, a treatment option for the common watery diarrhea syndrome equivalent to previously used absorbed antibacterial drugs has emerged. Rifaximin with an excellent safety profile and limited potential to induce coliform resistance, prevents most of the diarrhea that would otherwise occur. With further studies in different settings, new consideration should be given to the routine use of chemoprophylaxis for travelers to high-risk countries. Antibacterial drugs will continue to be the optimal treatment for travelers' diarrhea subjects for the most part caused by bacterial enteropathogens and shorten the duration of diarrhea by 1-2 days compared with no active drug treatment.},

Numerous experimental and clinical studies were performed recently and confirm both the efficacy and modes of action of probiotic drugs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a post-marketing-surveillance study with the probiotic Escherichia Coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) data on the range of indications as well as on efficacy and tolerance were gathered prospectively in 446 centres. The intended treatment duration was limited to a maximum of 12 weeks. RESULTS: EcN was used in 3,807 patients with more than 20 different indications, n = 3,511 of whom had gastrointestinal complaints: Among others, 1,067 patients presented with chronically recurring (n = 728) or protracted diarrhoea (n = 339), 415 with inflammatory bowel disease, 679 with irritable bowel syndrome, and 253 with chronic constipation. The overall efficacy was assessed as good to very good by an average of 81.4 % of the therapists. The stool frequency and consistency as well as the symptoms of meteorism and abdominal pain were improved in very many patients. Suspected cases of side effects were documented in only 2.8 % of the patients. CONCLUSION: EcN is frequently used in practice for the treatment of various, mostly gastrointestinal, complaints and is well tolerated.},

The use of probiotics in the therapy of infectious bowel diseases as well as maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis and in pouchitis is evidence-based. Also, in several studies proof could be supplied that specific probiotics relieve the symptoms and the course of irritable bowel syndrome. Some trials showed a significant improvement of irritable bowel syndrome-related constipation via Lactobacillus casei Shirota and E. coli Nissle 1917. Lactobacillus plantarum has been proven effective in reducing pain and abdominal bloating. However, in most of the studies rather small numbers of patients were examined. Furthermore, these studies do not always closely follow scientific standards (randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled). Therefore, confirmatory studies are necessary to examine the effect of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {An overlap of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) exists across subtype groups. Symptoms include intestinal gas, diarrhea, dyspepsia, bloating, abdominal pain, and constipation. The unifying symptom may be excessive intestinal gas as a by-product of intestinal microbial fermentation. Abnormal fermentation of food takes place when gut microbes expand proximally into the small intestine instead of being confined predominantly to the colon. Such proximal expansion of indigenous gut microbes or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may lead to activation of host mucosal immunity and an increase in intestinal permeability to result in flu-like extra-intestinal symptoms that accompany the classic IBS symptoms of altered bowels. The presence of methane on lactulose breath testing is associated with constipation-predominant IBS. Antibiotic therapy may be appropriate to treat underlying SIBO in IBS patients. Seventy-five percent improvement of IBS symptoms was reported in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study once antibiotics succeeded in treating bacterial overgrowth. Once a good clinical response and normalization of the lactulose breath test are achieved, a prokinetic agent may be used to stimulate phase III of interdigestive motility to delay relapse of bacterial overgrowth.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prebiotics are short-chain carbohydrates that alter the composition, or metabolism, of the gut microbiota in a beneficial manner. It is therefore expected that prebiotics will improve health in a way similar to probiotics, whilst at the same time being cheaper, and carrying less risk and being easier to incorporate into the diet than probiotics. AIM: To review published evidence for prebiotic effects on gut function and human health. METHODS: We searched the Science Citation Index with the terms prebiotic, microbiota, gut bacteria, large intestine, mucosa, bowel habit, constipation, diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, calcium and cancer, focussing principally on studies in humans and reports in the English language. Search of the Cochrane Library did not identify any clinical study or meta-analysis on this topic. RESULTS: Three prebiotics, oligofructose, galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose, clearly alter the balance of the large bowel microbiota by increasing bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus numbers. These carbohydrates are fermented and give rise to short-chain fatty acid and intestinal gas; however, effects on bowel habit are relatively small. Randomized-controlled trials of their effect in a clinical context are few, although animal studies show anti-inflammatory effects in inflammatory bowel disease, while calcium absorption is increased. CONCLUSIONS: It is still early days for prebiotics, but they offer the potential to modify the gut microbial balance in such a way as to bring direct health benefits cheaply and safely.},

   abstract = {Following the application of simple serological tests for the diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) in the 1980s, it gradually became clear that the prevalence of CD in different countries in the Middle East, North Africa and India is almost the same as that in Western countries. The prevalence of CD in at-risk populations in these regions is reported to range between 3 and 20% and the prevalence in people with type 1 diabetes is approximately 3-5%. Clinical manifestations of CD vary markedly with age, the duration and the extent of disease. Clinical studies showed that presentation with non-specific symptoms or no symptoms is as common in the Middle East as it is in Europe. Wheat has been the major staple food in these regions for many centuries and it is possible that the continuous and high level of exposure to wheat proteins has induced some degree of immune tolerance, leading to milder symptoms, which are misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome or unexplained gastrointestinal disorders. A high index of suspicion for CD should be maintained in all developing countries for patients who present with chronic diarrhoea or iron deficiency anaemia. The best method for diagnosing CD in patients with diarrhoea is the panel of coeliac serological tests followed by small-bowel biopsy. In the absence of supplies for a gluten-free diet in Middle Eastern countries, maintaining this diet represents a real challenge to both patients and clinicians.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that an increased cholecystectomy rate in the laparoscopic era may be due to a reduced threshold for surgery or diagnostic confusion with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This study aims to determine the validity of these suggestions. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to patients who had undergone cholecystectomy between 1988-1990 (open) and 1998-2000 (laparoscopic). Patients were asked about abdominal pain, fatty food intolerance, jaundice, and indigestion pre- and postoperatively. Questionnaires included Rome II criteria for the diagnosis of IBS and SF-36 quality-of-life data. Histological severity of gallbladder disease was assessed using a standard scoring system. RESULTS: A total of 124 of 196 patients in the open group and 264 of 400 patients in the laparoscopic group replied. There was no difference between the groups in gender, age at surgery, IBS incidence, or quality-of-life scores. The laparoscopic group reported a lower incidence of preoperative fat intolerance (45.8 vs 58.1%, p < 0.05) and a higher incidence of persistent postoperative abdominal pain (27.3 vs 17.7%, p < 0.05). Mean histopathology severity scores were higher in the open group (4.42 vs 3.95, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Increased cholecystectomy rate in the laparoscopic era cannot be attributed to diagnostic confusion with IBS. However, a reduction in the threshold for surgery may have contributed to the increased rate of cholecystectomy.},

   abstract = {Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common multifactorial intestinal disorder for which the aetiology remains largely undefined. Here, we have used a Trichinella spiralis (T. spiralis)-induced model of post-infective IBS, and the effects of probiotic bacteria on gut dysfunction have been investigated using a metabonomic strategy. A total of 44 mice were divided into four groups: an uninfected control group and three T. spiralis-infected groups, one as infected control and the two other groups subsequently treated with either Lactobacillus paracasei (L. paracasei) NCC2461 in spent culture medium (SCM) or with L. paracasei-free SCM. Plasma, jejunal wall and longitudinal myenteric muscle samples were collected at day 21 post-infection. An NMR-based metabonomic approach characterized that the plasma metabolic profile of T. spiralis-infected mice showed an increased energy metabolism (lactate, citrate, alanine), fat mobilization (acetoacetate, 3-D-hydroxybutyrate, lipoproteins) and a disruption of amino acid metabolism due to increased protein breakdown, which were related to the intestinal hypercontractility. Increased levels of taurine, creatine and glycerophosphorylcholine in the jejunal muscles were associated with the muscular hypertrophy and disrupted jejunal functions. L. paracasei treatment normalized the muscular activity and the disturbed energy metabolism as evidenced by decreased glycogenesis and elevated lipid breakdown in comparison with untreated T. spiralis-infected mice. Changes in the levels of plasma metabolites (glutamine, lysine, methionine) that might relate to a modulation of immunological responses were also observed in the presence of the probiotic treatment. The work presented here suggests that probiotics may be beneficial in patients with IBS.},

   abstract = {Intolerance to certain foods can cause a range of gut and systemic symptoms. The possibility that these can be caused by lactose has been missed because of "hidden" lactose added to many foods and drinks inadequately labelled, confusing diagnosis based on dietary removal of dairy foods. Two polymorphisms, C/T13910 and G/A22018, linked to hypolactasia, correlate with breath hydrogen and symptoms after lactose. This, with a 48 hour record of gut and systemic symptoms and a six hour breath hydrogen test, provides a new approach to the clinical management of lactose intolerance. The key is the prolonged effect of dietary removal of lactose. Patients diagnosed as lactose intolerant must be advised of "risk" foods, inadequately labelled, including processed meats, bread, cake mixes, soft drinks, and lagers. This review highlights the wide range of systemic symptoms caused by lactose intolerance. This has important implications for the management of irritable bowel syndrome, and for doctors of many specialties.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain that is associated with disturbed defecation. Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD appears to result from dysregulated immune response with contributions from genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Among environmental factors the enteric microflora and the components of food (eg. antigens) may play important role in the pathogenesis of IBD. The aim of the authors' study was to detect IgE type antibodies against the most frequent food allergens in patients with IBD and IBS. METHODS: Antibodies against food allergens (IgE type) with ELISA method in patients with CD, UC and IBS were quantitatively measured. The figures were compared to the result of a healthy control group contains the same number of participants, and the frequency of food allergy in these patient groups were determined. RESULTS: On the basis of the study the presence of increased IgE type immune response against any food allergens was 34.5% (p = 0.01) in the group of IBS. In patients with CD or UC the immune response against food allergens was also more frequent than in the control group. The order of frequency of food allergens in IBS was the following: milk protein, soybean, tomato, peanut, egg white. CONCLUSION: As the occurrence of food allergens was significantly higher in IBS group than in the control group, the role of food allergy in the symptoms of IBS can be come up. The frequency of food allergy in patients with diagnosis of IBS, and the similarity of symptoms of this two diseases give an obvious opportunity for the patients with IBS to use a diet avoiding the most frequent food allergens, or take e.g. Na-cromoglycate which is useful therapy in food allergy.},

However, it is unknown if this also happens in primary-care or whether a better response to bran occurs, leading to bran failures being selected for referral to the specialist. AIMS: To assess the response to bran in primary-care irritable bowel syndrome comparing it to that obtained in secondary-care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutive primary-care irritable bowel syndrome patients were asked how bran or soluble fibre products affected their symptoms. RESULTS: Bran improved symptoms in 27% of primary-care and 10% of secondary-care patients (p<0.01) and exacerbated symptoms in 22% of primary-care and 55% of secondary-care patients (p<0.001). Fifty-one percent of primary-care and 33% of secondary-care patients reported no change with bran. In primary-care, proprietary fibre led to improvement in 25%, deterioration in 19% and no change in 56% which was not significantly different to secondary-care. CONCLUSION: Although not especially effective in primary-care irritable bowel syndrome patients, bran does not cause so many problems and is more helpful than in secondary-care. The effects of soluble fibre are similar in both primary-care and secondary-care. This study highlights the problem of extrapolating the response to treatment in irritable bowel syndrome from different care settings.},

   abstract = {We studied the prevalence as well as the sociodemographic characteristics and QOL of older adults (> 50 years) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among the population at large and compared it to their younger counterparts'. We hypothesized that IBS is less prevalent among older persons and they suffer poorer QOL compared to younger IBS patients. A total of 1000 adults from nine sites, including a medical center, churches, and a blood bank in our metropolitan area (670 African Americans, 320 Caucasians, and 10 others), completed self-administered questionnaires providing sociodemographic information and details regarding bowel habits and associated symptoms for diagnosing the IBS based on Rome II criteria. QOL was assessed by the SF-12 questionnaire. The study database was divided into two groups, younger (< 50 years) and older (> or = 50 years). The two age groups were similar with respect to gender and household income. Ninety-five of the 1000 participants had IBS, giving a total sample prevalence of 9.5% (< 50 years, 9.9%, vs > or = 50 years, 7.6%). The prevalence of IBS was similar in the two groups irrespective of race, sex, marital status, size of household, location of residence (rural versus urban), level of educational status, and household income. Compared to the older group, there was a trend toward a higher prevalence of IBS among divorced subjects (12.7% vs 0%; P = 0.1) and those below poverty level of income (15.3% vs 7.5%; P = 0.09) in the younger subjects. In contrast, older IBS patients were more likely to attend church regularly (32.5% vs 58.8%; P < 0.05). There were no differences in history of traveler's diarrhea, food intolerance, and drug allergies between the two groups. Health care utilization was similar between the two IBS groups in terms of number of physician visits, use of prescription and alternative medications, and being disabled due to IBS. There was no difference in the overall QOL score means (27.8 vs 29.5; P = NS) or in its general health and physical functioning components. However, older IBS patients had better social functioning (9.1 vs 9.8; P < 0.05). Although in our study IBS occurred less frequently among older adults than among younger patients, the difference is not statistically significant. While IBS affects QOL at all ages, social functioning was actually better on average among older compared to younger IBS patients.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: National health survey. SUBJECTS: A selection of the population (n=11,078) in Oppland county, Norway, was invited to a health screening, and a sample of subjects with IBS were included in the study. INTERVENTIONS: A medical history of food intolerance, musculoskeletal pain, mood disorders and abdominal complaints was taken, and tests were performed for food allergy and malabsorption. A dietician evaluated the dietary habits of the subjects. RESULTS: Out of 4,622 subjects with adequately filled-in questionnaires, 84 were included in the study, 59 (70%) had symptoms related to intake of food, 62% limited or excluded food items from the diet and 12% had an inadequate diet. The mean numbers of food items related to symptoms and the number of foods limited or excluded from the diet were 4.8 and 2.5, respectively. There were no associations between the tests for food allergy and malabsorption and perceived food intolerance. Perceived food intolerance was unrelated to musculoskeletal pain and mood disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived food intolerance is a common problem with significant nutritional consequences in a population with IBS. The uselessness of current antibody tests and tests for malabsorption and the lack of correlation to psychiatric co-morbidity make the etiology obscure.},

   abstract = {AIM: Some people believe that chocolate and other foods or beverages may cause constipation. This study was undertaken to quantify the effect of potentially constipating foods and beverages on apparently healthy and constipated populations of German individuals. METHODS: A questionnaire asking for the effect of certain foods and beverages on stool form (perceived consistency) was answered by 200 healthy controls, 122 patients with chronic constipation, and 766 patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). RESULTS: Patients with constipation or IBS-C reported altered stool form after food and beverage consumption more often than controls (controls 42.5% vs constipation 52.0% vs IBS-C 57.0%, P < 0.001). Controls experienced hardening of stools less often and experienced softening more often than either constipation or IBS-C patients. When patients were asked which foods or beverages caused constipation (open ended question), chocolate was most frequently mentioned, followed by white bread and bananas. The results of systematic questioning yielded chocolate (48-64% of respondents), bananas (29-48%), and black tea (14-24%) as constipating, while prunes (41-52%), coffee (14-24%), wine (8-30%), beer (14-24%), and smoking (42-70% in those who smoked) were considered stool softeners. CONCLUSION: Several foodstuffs may exert an effect on stool consistency. Chocolate, bananas and black tea are perceived to cause constipation, while prunes are perceived to soften stools in many people. Coffee, wine and beer were perceived to soften stools in a minority of people. Cigarettes are perceived to soften stools by about half of the smokers.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The relationship between allergy and motility has been controversial. There is, however, accumulating evidence demonstrating that mucosal allergic responses may disrupt gut motility, and may also potentially alter nociceptive pathways to cause visceral hyperalgesia. RECENT FINDINGS: Experimental studies implicate T helper 2 cells and the cytokines interleukin-4 and -13 in antigen-induced dysmotility, and interleukin-5 in the pathogenesis of mucosal eosinophilia. Both mast cells and eosinophils play obligatory roles in different forms of experimental antigen-induced dysmotility. Overall clinical findings appear to implicate eosinophil infiltration in proximal and distal dysmotility syndromes (oesophageal, gastric and colorectal), and induced mast cell degranulation in mid-gut dysmotility. There is also evidence that mucosal allergic responses may induce long-term changes in visceral perception, including alteration of limbic response, leading to sustained abnormality in visceral sensation. SUMMARY: Clinical evidence implicating mucosal allergic responses in dysmotility has been extended to include disorders considered previously entirely functional, such as in some cases of irritable bowel syndrome. Only a proportion of cases are, however, caused by food allergy and a future challenge is to differentiate patients with similar symptoms, but induced by different mechanisms.},

There is also an increased recognition of the breadth of immunologically mediated responses to dietary antigens; the area of non-IgE-mediated food allergy is belatedly acquiring scientific respectability, aided by improved clinical recognition and basic scientific studies. The role of mucosal mast cells and eosinophils in intestinal allergic responses is now better recognized, and conditions such as eosinophilic oesophagitis are more prevalent than previously thought. However, the diagnostic difficulties of non-IgE-mediated allergies remain challenging.},

Probiotics may ease symptoms in IBS patients by changing gut microflora, reducing mucosal inflammation and exerting antibacterial effects. AIM: To assess the short- and long-term effects of Lactobacillus reuteri administration on clinical symptoms of IBS. METHODS: This is a double blind, placebo-controlled 6-month trial. Subjects consumed 1x10(8)cfu/tablet twice a day. The clinical severity of the IBS symptoms was evaluated by the Francis Severity score and the IBS quality-of-life score at study entry and then monthly. RESULTS: In total, 54 subjects were randomized for treatment and 39 concluded the study. Both groups (treatment and placebo) improved significantly in all the studied parameters with no significant differences between groups. Two parameters, constipation and passing gases, were marginally different between the main groups (P=0.0714 and 0.0971, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: IBS symptoms did not improve with probiotic treatment with L. reuteri. A strong placebo effect and a lack of uniformity of the IBS population may have hindered a clearer demonstration of the effect.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare the response of symptoms and cytokine ratios in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with ingestion of probiotic preparations containing a lactobacillus or bifidobacterium strain. METHODS: Seventy-seven subjects with IBS were randomized to receive either Lactobacillus salivarius UCC4331 or Bifidobacterium infantis 35624, each in a dose of 1 x 10 10 live bacterial cells in a malted milk drink, or the malted milk drink alone as placebo for 8 weeks. The cardinal symptoms of IBS were recorded on a daily basis and assessed each week. Quality of life assessment, stool microbiologic studies, and blood sampling for estimation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell release of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12 were performed at the beginning and at the end of the treatment phase. RESULTS: For all symptoms, with the exception of bowel movement frequency and consistency, those randomized to B infantis 35624 experienced a greater reduction in symptom scores; composite and individual scores for abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/distention, and bowel movement difficulty were significantly lower than for placebo for those randomized to B infantis 35624 for most weeks of the treatment phase. At baseline, patients with IBS demonstrated an abnormal IL-10/IL-12 ratio, indicative of a proinflammatory, Th-1 state. This ratio was normalized by B infantis 35624 feeding alone. CONCLUSIONS: B infantis 35624 alleviates symptoms in IBS; this symptomatic response was associated with normalization of the ratio of an anti-inflammatory to a proinflammatory cytokine, suggesting an immune-modulating role for this organism, in this disorder.},

IBS can be diagnosed with confidence when a patient fulfills the Rome II criteria for IBS and displays no warning signs, as determined by a careful history and physical examination. In the past numerous test were considered routine for patients with suspected IBS, however, available data do not support this approach. The etiology of IBS remains unknown and therefore the treatment is focused on relieving symptoms rather than curing the disease. The patient main complaints such as constipation, diarrhea or bloating-pain-gas, determine the therapies of choice, according the severity of them.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, and constipation are gastrointestinal dysmotility and sensory symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). No studies have followed patients with IBS symptoms for 1 year under conditions of routine clinical practice to assess prospectively the impact of treatments on health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this ongoing, naturalistic study is to assess the long-term impact of IBS treatments on quality of life (QOL), work productivity, and resource utilization. This report describes the baseline characteristics and patterns of care of the patients enrolled in this study. METHODS: Patients with physician-diagnosed IBS symptoms were enrolled from 147 physician sites across Canada between May 4, 2004, and March 31, 2005. Clinical data were collected at baseline and at the end of the 12-month follow-up (patients were followed for 1 year between May 4, 2005, and March 31, 2006). Patient-reported outcomes were collected at baseline and at months 1, 2, 6, 9, and 12. Health-related QOL, health status, and work productivity were assessed with the IBS-QOL, a 5-item EuroQol descriptive system, and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaires, respectively. A resource utilization questionnaire elicited information on physician; visits, treatments, and procedures. Baseline data are reported here. RESULTS: Data were obtained from 1555 patients; 85.1% (1320/1552) were women. Patients had a mean (SD) age of 45.8 (15.0) years and mean (SD) duration of IBS symptoms of 11.4 (11.5) years. Self-reported bowel patterns were predominantly constipation (41.0%, 587/1433) and constipation alternating with diarrhea (39.4%, 564/1433); 60.3% (938/1555) of subjects used > or =3 IBS treatments in the previous 4 weeks. Approximately 50% of all patients reported distress "quite a bit or "extremely" for abdominal pain, gas, bloating, and constipation. The mean overall IBS-QOL score (0-100 scale, with 0 indicating poor QOL) was 66.3; food avoidance (51.8) and health worry (59.3) were the most serious concerns. Patients reported 5.6% work absenteeism, 31.4% presenteeism, and 34.6% overall work productivity loss, equivalent to 13.8 hours lost productivity per 40-hour workweek. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline data from this ongoing, prospective, naturalistic study are consistent with previous findings that suggested significant use of health care resources with concomitant low QOL and decreased work productivity in patients with IBS symptoms.},

Gastrointestinal symptoms (GSRS), quality of life (SF-36), and psychological symptoms (HADS) were evaluated at baseline, during treatment (months 1 and 3), and at follow-up (month 6). In both groups symptoms and quality of life improved significantly after the first month of administration until follow-up compared to those at baseline. However, the improvement was significantly reduced at follow-up compared to the end of treatment. PHGG was effective for improving somatic (gastrointestinal symptoms) and psychological (quality of life and psychological distress) symptoms over the short term. Since the improvement tended to decrease after the end of the treatment period, further studies should evaluate the benefits of PHGG at a maintenance dosage.},

This systematic review evaluates the role of food allergy in aetiology and management of these disorders. Activation of gastrointestinal mucosal immune system may be one of the causative factors in the pathogenesis of functional dyspepsia and IBS. This activation may result from effects of bacterial infection or other luminal factors including commensal microbial flora and food antigens. Some studies have reported on the role of food allergy in IBS; only one epidemiological study on functional dyspepsia and food allergy has been published. The mechanism by which food activates mucosal immune system is uncertain, but food specific IgE and IgG4 appeared to mediate the hypersensitivity reaction in a subgroup of IBS patients. Exclusion diets based on skin prick test, RAST for IgE or IgG4, hypoallergic diet and clinical trials with oral disodium cromoglycate have been conducted, and some success has been reported in a subset of IBS patients. Further well-controlled studies are needed to establish whether food allergy plays a role in the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia and IBS.},

The progressive unravelling of these plant and bacterial effects on systemic immune and intestinal epithelial cell function has led to new credence for the use of probiotics and nutraceuticals in clinical medicine. Level I evidence now exists for the therapeutic use of probiotics in infectious diarrhea in children, recurrent Clostridium difficile-induced infections and post-operative pouchitis. Additional evidence is being acquired for the use of probiotics in other gastrointestinal infections, irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. Not all individual probiotic strains have the same efficacy, and future clinical trials may focus on multistrain preparations agents with known efficacy. The use of nutraceuticals and probiotics as therapeutic agents for gastrointestinal disorders is rapidly moving into clinical usage. Scientific studies are providing mechanisms of action to explain the therapeutic effects, and randomized controlled trials are providing the necessary evidence for their incorporation into the therapeutic armamentarium.},

   abstract = {To evaluate the clinical significance of colonic eosinophilia, we conducted a retrospective study of all children older than 1 year evaluated at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh from January 1999 to June 2001 with a description of colonic eosinophilia in the pathology report. Medical records were reviewed. Diagnoses were confirmed by contacting the patients. Histological slides (H&E) were reviewed by an investigator blind to the patients' data. Biopsies were grouped according to the site they were taken from and then screened at low power for areas of maximal eosinophilia for further quantitative analysis. Results of manual counts were validated by image analysis using Metaphor Image Analysis Software. Sixty-nine children with colonic eosinophilia were identified (36 male; mean age, 135.2 +/- 55.4 months). Their final diagnoses were inflammatory bowel disease in 32% (group A), irritable bowel syndrome in 33% (group B), food allergies in 10% (group C), and other diagnoses in 25% (group D). The maximal eosinophil count per crypt area was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in group A vs groups B, C, and D (34.8 +/- 17.1 vs 21.3 +/- 8.8, 25.4 +/- 16.7, and 24.2 +/- 9.7, respectively). The total cellularity of the lamina propria was considered high only in group A (P < 0.05 vs groups B and C). A mostly equal vertical distribution of eosinophils throughout the lamina propria was found significantly more frequently in group A vs groups C (P = 0.04) and D (P = 0.007). We conclude that children with inflammatory bowel disease have an equal distribution of eosinophils throughout the lamina propria, with intraepithelial and intracryptal eosinophils and with a higher overall total cellularity. In irritable bowel syndrome and patients with a variety of other diagnoses, including allergies, the distribution is mostly superficial, with a lower total cellularity.},

   abstract = {Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide hormone which is found both in the gastrointestinal tract throughout the human small intestine and nerves in the myenteric plexus of the enteric nervous system and in the central nervous system. This dual location constitutes the anatomical basis for this in functions as a hormone and a neurotransmitter implicated in the regulation of both systems. CCK regulates not only motor functions in the gastrointestinal tract like lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation, gastric secretion and emptying, gall bladder contractility and bile secretion into the duodenum, intestinal and colonic motility, but also sensory functions and plays a role in the regulation of food intake. These effects are mediated through selective receptors CCK1 and CCK2. Over the last few years, research has focused on understanding the role of CCK, its receptors with antagonists at the biological, pharmacological, clinical and therapeutic level. As far as the CCK1 antagonists is concerned, important inroads have been made in the potential role of these antagonists in the treatment of GERD, IBS and pancreatitis. They have also shown encouraging results in sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and some gastrointestinal cancers. This review focuses on the recent ad vances of the biological role of CCK and their CCK1 antagonists: their current basic and clinical status in gastroenterology, with particular emphasis on the potential therapeutic role of the CCK1 antagonists and future research directions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common health problem, often presenting in primary care as well as in internal medicine and gastroenterology outpatient clinics. Therapeutic options are dominated by drug therapies but there is uncertainty about their effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of bulking agents, antispasmodic and antidepressant medication for the treatment of IBS. SEARCH STRATEGY: A computer assisted search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo and the Cochrane Library was performed for the years 1966-2001; local and national databases were searched in 10 European countries. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing bulking agents, antispasmodic or antidepressant medications with a placebo, in IBS patients over 12 years of age. Only studies published as a full paper were included. No language criterion was applied. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The search identified 687 studies, 66 of which fulfilled all eligibility criteria. After removal of cross-over studies that did not report separately on the first phase, data from 40 studies remained for analysis. Relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and standardized mean difference (SMD) along with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all subgroups. The number needed to treat (NNT) was also calculated where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-one study reports from 40 studies, comprising 78 comparisons, were analysed. These included 11 reports on bulking agents, 6 on antidepressants, and 24 on spasmolytics.BULKING AGENTS: Three studies comprising 159 patients reported a dichotomous outcome for relief of abdominal pain. The pooled RR using a random effects model was 1.22 (95% CI 0.86 - 1.73). Three studies comprising 128 patients reported a continuous outcome for relief of abdominal pain. Using the random effects model, the SMD was 0.68 (95% CI -0.86 - 2.33). Nine studies comprising 482 patients reported a dichotomous outcome for global assessment of improvement. The pooled RR was 1.09 (95% CI 0.78 - 1.50). Five studies comprising 253 patients reported a dichotomous outcome for improvement of symptom score. The pooled RR using a random effects model was 0.93 (95% CI 0.56 - 1.54). Two studies comprising 70 patients reported a continuous outcome for improvement of symptom score; the SMD using a fixed effects model was -0.44 (95% CI -1.20 - 0.31). SPASMOLYTIC AGENTS: Eleven studies comprising 1260 patients reported a dichotomous outcome for relief of abdominal pain. The pooled RR using a random effects model was 1.34 (95% CI 1.13 - 1.59; RD=0.17, 95% CI 0.06 -0.28; NNT=6, 95% CI 4 - 15). Seven studies comprising 467 patients reported a continuous outcome for relief of abdominal pain. Using a fixed effects model the pooled SMD was -0.65 (95% CI -0.94 to -0.35). Sixteen studies comprising 1236 patients reported a dichotomous outcome for global assessment of improvement. The pooled RR using a random effects model was 1.42 (95% CI 1.17 - 1.72; RD=0.20, 95% CI 0.09 -0.30; NNT=5, 95% CI 3 - 11). One study comprising 34 patients reported a dichotomous variable for improvement of symptom score. The RR was 1.33 (95% CI 0.96 - 1.85). Three studies reported a continuous outcome for improvement of symptom score; two studies comprising 66 patients could be pooled. Using a fixed effects model, the SMD was -0.37 (95% CI -0.85 - 0.12). ANTIDEPRESSANTS: Two studies comprising 81 patients reported a dichotomous outcome for relief of abdominal pain. Using the random effects model, the pooled RR was 0.83 (95% CI 0.33 - 2.12). Two studies comprising 101 patients reported a continuous outcome for relief of abdominal pain. The SMD using a random effects model was -0.53 (95% CI -2.29 - 1.23). Four studies comprising 241 patients reported a dichotomous variable for global assessment of improvement. The pooled RR was 1.16 (95% CI 0.78 - 1.73). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for efficacy of drug therapies for IBS is weak. Although there is evidence of benefit for antispasmodic drugs for abdominal pain and global assessment of symptoms; it is unclear whether anti-spasmodic subgroups are individually effective. There is no clear evidence of benefit for antidepressants or bulking agents. The physician should be aware that global assessment is a construct containing various dimensions. For each individual, these will have a different weighting and treatment should be aimed at the most debilitating symptom. Stool problems are by definition part of the IBS symptom complex. Bulking agents may improve constipation and can be used empirically, but should be evaluated at an early stage for individual benefit. Future research should pay attention to study methodology and the use of valid outcome measures.},

   abstract = {Salicylate intolerance is defined as a nonspecific antigen-induced pseudo-allergic hypersensitivity reaction which can occur upon contact of an organism with salicylic acid, its derivatives or other related organic or inorganic acids of similar chemical structure. Since the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) intolerance are by no means always severe or life-endangering but may just as well present as oligosymptomatic or local disorders (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhea, we decided to evaluate the characteristics of patients with salicylate intolerance on the basis of gastroenterological case material of Medical Department I of Erlangen University. On the basis of the findings from the Erlangen interdisciplinary data register of chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, the signs and symptoms of NSAID intolerance were found to constitute a diagnosis of great practical import to clinical medicine (allergology, dermatology, immunology, other disorders etc.) including gastroenterology. For approx. 2-7% of all patients with inflammatory bowel syndrome and food allergies this poses a new diagnostic and therapeutic challenge which may concern physicians from any of the disciplines involved. When presented with patients with chronic active disease who are suffering from these symptoms one should, therefore, in future give greater thought to the possibility of salicylate intolerance, all the more as there are meaningful dietetic, diagnostic and therapeutic options available for these persons.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the clinical features at presentation as well as the associated disorders, family history, and evaluation of compliance with a gluten-free diet in children with celiac disease from across Canada. STUDY DESIGN: All members (n = 5240) of the Canadian Celiac Association were surveyed with a questionnaire. Of the 2849 respondents with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease, 168 who were < 16 years old provided the data reported here. RESULTS: The mean age when surveyed was 9.1 +/- 4.1 years, and 58% were female. Median age at diagnosis was 3.0 years with a range of 1 to 15 years. Presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (90%), weight loss (71%), diarrhea (65%), weakness (64%), nausea/vomiting (53%), anemia (40%), mood swings (37%), and constipation (30%). Almost one third of families consulted > or = 2 pediatricians before confirmation of the diagnosis. Before the recognition of celiac disease, other diagnoses received by these children included anemia (15%), irritable bowel syndrome (11%), gastroesophageal reflux (8%), stress (8%), and peptic ulcer disease (4%). A serological test was performed to screen for celiac disease in 70% of those in this population. Eight percent had either type 1 diabetes mellitus or a first-degree relative with celiac disease. Almost all respondents (95%) reported strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, and 89% noted improved health. Reactions after accidental gluten ingestion developed in 54% of the children between 0.5 and 60 hours after ingestion with a median of 2.0 hours. Reactions included abdominal discomfort (87%), diarrhea (64%), bloating (57%), fatigue (37%), headache (24%), and constipation (8%), and most displayed > 1 symptom. Although most adjusted well to their disease and diet, 10% to 20% reported major disruptions in lifestyle. Twenty-three percent felt angry all or most of the time about following a gluten-free diet. Only 15% avoided traveling all or most of the time, and during travel, 83% brought gluten-free food with them all of the time. More than half of the families avoided restaurants all or most of the time. Twenty-eight percent of the respondents found it extremely difficult to locate stores with gluten-free foods, and 27% reported extreme difficulty in finding gluten-free foods or determining if foods were free of gluten. Sixty-three percent of the respondents felt that the information supplied by the Canadian Celiac Association was excellent. Gastroenterologists provided excellent information to 44%, dietitians to 36%, and the family physician to 11.5%. When asked to select 2 items that would improve their quality of life, better labeling of gluten-containing ingredients was selected by 63%, more gluten-free foods in the supermarket by 49%, gluten-free choices on restaurant menus by 49%, earlier diagnosis of celiac disease by 34%, and better dietary counseling by 7%. CONCLUSIONS: In Canada, children with celiac disease present at all ages with a variety of symptoms and associated conditions. Delays in diagnosis are common. Most children are compliant with a gluten-free diet. A minority of these children experience difficulties in modifying their lifestyles, and gluten-free foods remain difficult to obtain.},

A longitudinal, prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken. The duration of treatment was eight to 12 weeks and this consisted of 10-20 g/day of coarse wheat bran or a low fibre placebo taken in addition to the normal diet. Twenty-eight outpatients fulfilling the Rome criteria for constipation-predominant IBS were recruited to the trial (14 in the treatment group; 14 in the placebo group). Twelve people completed the trial in the treatment group and ten in the placebo group. The main outcome measures included changes in symptoms recorded in a diary, changes in objective measurements of bowel function and subjective overall feelings of improvement. The bran group significantly increased their non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) intake over that of the placebo group (p < 0.05). Mean stool wet weight increased significantly more in the bran group than in the placebo group (p < 0.05), but other bowel function measurements and all recorded symptoms were not different. Many patients reported changes in bowel habit that were not reflected in the objective measurements. The addition of coarse wheat bran to the diet increased NSP ingestion and stool wet weight in this group of IBS patients, but no evidence was obtained that such treatment was of benefit to these patients, other than a placebo effect on symptoms.},

QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: A few level I studies support the effectiveness of specific probiotics for certain diagnoses. For most so-called probiotics, however, weak or no evidence supports their effectiveness. MAIN MESSAGE: Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. Level I evidence supports use of VSL#3 for maintaining remission of inflammatory colitis. Probiotics for treating vaginal infections, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14, have level I evidence of effectiveness, but are not available in Canada. Specific probiotics taken for certain indications improve health and have few side effects. CONCLUSION: Limited but good evidence supports the role of certain probiotics in medical practice. Because consumer pressure will undoubtedly stimulate further interest in probiotics, family doctors need to be informed about them so they can advise their patients appropriately.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review recently published studies investigating any association between gut flora and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: Experimental studies demonstrate associations between gut flora, gut motility, mucosal inflammation and visceral hypersensitivity. Scientific bases for possible benefits of selected probiotics on irritable bowel symptoms have been identified. Disturbances in viable counts of fecal flora have been demonstrated in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Results of studies based on breath tests are conflicting as to whether the prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is increased in this group. Nonetheless, a longitudinal analysis based on bacteriological assessments of serial small intestinal aspirates suggests that this entity should be considered in patients with irritable bowel symptoms, especially in the setting of predisposition to bacterial overgrowth. Clinical trials of probiotic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome have yielded conflicting results. SUMMARY: Recent studies provide increasing support for the concept that disturbances in gut flora occur in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and that such abnormalities may contribute to irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms. The relative importance of disturbed gut flora to symptom pathogenesis, along with the therapeutic potential of modulation of the gut flora for amelioration of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, however, remains to be fully defined.},

Our aim was to find out if sensitization could induce chronic functional motor disturbances in the intestine and the mechanisms implicated. Rats were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) following three hypersensitivity induction protocols, two parenteral and one oral. Rat mast cell protease II (RMCP II) release in response to OVA challenge and immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentration were measured in serum. At least 1 week after challenge, small intestinal motility was evaluated using strain gauges. Intestinal tissue samples from orally sensitized rats were checked for in vitro stimulation with OVA. Mucosal mast cells were counted from duodenum sections. All sensitized rats showed intestinal hypermotility. Only rats sensitized by parenteral procedure showed an increase in RMCP II after OVA challenge in serum. IgEs increased only in the Bordetella pertussis sensitized group. Small intestine sections from orally sensitized rats released more RMCP II than sections from control rats. All sensitized rats showed an increase in the number of mucosal mast cells in duodenum. In conclusion, hypersensitivity to food proteins induces chronic motor alteration that persists long after antigen challenge and an excited/activated state of sensitized mucosal mast cells.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet has been implicated to play a role in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in clinic-based studies. No population-based data comparing food and nutrient consumption between individuals with FGID and without gastrointestinal symptoms are available. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the dietary consumption of specific food items and nutrients between individuals with FGID and without symptoms in a population-based sample. METHODS: A validated self-report Bowel Disease Questionnaire was mailed to an age- and gender-stratified random sample of participants aged 20-50 yr from Olmsted County, Minnesota. All patients who reported either FGID symptoms (irritable bowel or dyspepsia) or no gastrointestinal symptoms were invited to undergo a blinded physician interview and physical exam and to complete a validated Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In total, 222 of the 260 eligible (85%) subjects participated and 218 provided diet data: 99 were FGID cases and 119 were healthy controls. Cases and controls consumed similar number of servings per week of wheat-containing foods, lactose-containing foods, caffeinated drinks, and fructose-sweetened beverages. Cases were slightly more likely to consume >or=7 servings per week of norepinephrine- and epinephrine-containing foods (57%vs 45%, p= 0.10), but not serotonin- or tryptophan-containing foods. No differences were observed for amount of intake of calories, fiber, protein, iron, calcium, niacin, and vitamins C, D, E, niacin, B(1), B(2), B(6), and B(12). Cases reported consuming more fat (median, 33%vs 31%) and less carbohydrates (median, 49%vs 52%) than controls. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were seen in the consumption of frequently suspected "culprit" foods between community residents with and without FGID symptoms. While symptoms may be due to food sensitivity rather than altered diet composition, the role of fat and perhaps norepinephrine and epinephrine in foods in gut symptoms needs to be studied further.},

   abstract = {The human intestine is colonized by a large number of microorganisms, collectively termed microbiota, which support a variety of physiological functions. As the major part of the microbiota has not yet been cultured, molecular methods are required to determine microbial composition and the impact of specific dietary components including probiotics. Probiotics are viable microbial food supplements, which have a beneficial impact on human health. Health-promoting properties have been demonstrated for specific probiotic products. The most significant demonstrations for probiotic efficacy include prevention and treatment of antibiotic associated diarrhea, rotavirus diarrhea and allergy prevention. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (=ATCC 53103) and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 are the among the best-characterized and most studied probiotic strains with demonstrated impact on human health. New complex targets for probiotics include irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori infection. For future probiotics the most important target is a demonstrated clinical benefit supported by knowledge on the mechanistic actions in the microbiota of the target population. Molecular and genomics-based knowledge of the composition and functions of the microbiota, as well as deviations from the balanced microbiota, will advance the selection of new and specific probiotics. Potential combinations of specific probiotics may prove to be the next step to reduce the risk on intestinal diseases and reconstruct specific microbial deviations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Histamine is known as a regulator of gastrointestinal functions, such as gastric acid production, intestinal motility, and mucosal ion secretion. Most of this knowledge has been obtained from animal studies. In contrast, in humans, expression and distribution of histamine receptors (HR) within the human gastrointestinal tract are unclear. METHODS: We analysed HR expression in human gastrointestinal tissue specimens by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining. RESULTS: We found that H1R, H2R, and H4R mRNA were expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, while H3R mRNA was absent. No significant differences in the distribution of HR were found between different anatomical sites (duodenum, ileum, colon, sigma, and rectum). Immunostaining of neurones and nerve fibres revealed that H3R was absent in the human enteric nervous system; however, H1R and H2R were found on ganglion cells of the myenteric plexus. Epithelial cells also expressed H1R, H2R and, to some extent, H4R. Intestinal fibroblasts exclusively expressed H1R while the muscular layers of human intestine stained positive for both H1R and H2R. Immune cells expressed mRNA and protein for H1R, H2R, and low levels of H4R. Analysis of endoscopic biopsies from patients with food allergy and irritable bowel syndrome revealed significantly elevated H1R and H2R mRNA levels compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that H1R, H2R and, to some extent, H4R, are expressed in the human gastrointestinal tract, while H3R is absent, and we found that HR expression was altered in patients with gastrointestinal diseases.},

   abstract = {Many studies have attempted to identify specific positive health effects of probiotics. One of the challenges in generalizing health effects of probiotics is that different strains exert disparate effects on human health. As a result, the efficacy of one strain or species cannot necessarily be inferred from another. The objective of this review is to examine the current scientific literature that could be used as the basis for potential health claims. More specifically, this paper will review existing evidence of different probiotic strains to prevent and treat diarrhea, treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), treat inflammatory bowel disease, and prevent colon cancer. The strongest evidence is related to the use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in the prevention and treatment of rotavirus-associated diarrhea. Further examination of the literature also shows promise in the treatment of some forms of IBS with probiotics. Future studies that use consistent supplementation regimes will allow more definitive conclusions to be drawn on the effects of probiotics on IBS, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer.},

To elucidate possible modes of action, the focus of this study is on antioxidant properties of the phytomedicine STW 5. In fact, functional gastrointestinal diseases, such as non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) and irritable bowel syndrome, are often initiated by or correlated to inflammatory processes, where oxidants such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role. Prominent in vivo sources of ROS generation are represented by the enzymes xanthine oxidase (XOD) or myeloperoxidase (MPO). Applying these enzymes in models in vitro, we show that STW 5 and its components possess strong antioxidant activities. Depending on the model investigated, even pro-oxidant activities of single components of STW 5 could be observed. Interestingly, these effects were absent in STW 5, indicating cooperation between the components. Moreover, if one of the component extracts of STW 5 is omitted, the antioxidant activity is reduced. Thus we conclude that all the single extracts combined in STW 5 are of importance for the therapeutic effect, working in concert. The component of STW 5 performing best in vitro differed with the model investigated, respectively, with ROS and ROS generators. In the XOD system, the extracts of lemon balm leaf and peppermint leaf showed the best antioxidant result, whereas concerning MPO driven chlorination reactions, bitter candy tuft extract was the most efficient antioxidant. Best protection against peroxynitrite induced oxidation of methionine like sulfur-compounds exhibited the STW 5 components lemon balm leaf, Matricaria flower and peppermint leaf.},

The objective was to retrospectively evaluate a potentially successful diet therapy in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and fructose malabsorption. Tables detailing the content of fructose and fructans in foods were constructed. A dietary strategy comprising avoidance of foods containing substantial free fructose and short-chain fructans, limitation of the total dietary fructose load, encouragement of foods in which glucose was balanced with fructose, and co-ingestion of free glucose to balance excess free fructose was devised. Sixty-two consecutively referred patients with irritable bowel syndrome and fructose malabsorption on breath hydrogen testing underwent dietary instruction. Dietary adherence and effect on abdominal symptoms were evaluated via telephone interview 2 to 40 months (median 14 months) later. Response to the diet was defined as improvement of all symptoms by at least 5 points on a -10- to 10-point scale. Forty-eight patients (77%) adhered to the diet always or frequently. Forty-six (74%) of all patients responded positively in all abdominal symptoms. Positive response overall was significantly better in those adherent than nonadherent (85% vs 36%; P<0.01), as was improvement in individual symptoms (P<0.01 for all symptoms). This comprehensive fructose malabsorption dietary therapy achieves a high level of sustained adherence and good symptomatic response.},

Moreover, foods are thought to often play a role in the diarrhea type IBS particularly in patients with atopic dermatitis. More than 50% of diarrhea type IBS patients have a history of allergies to some food and positive skin prick tests. Surveys indicate that as many as 20-30 % of adults have some problems to foods, however, careful studies have suggested a range from <1% to 7.5%. A systematic review of the literature concluded that it is still unclear whether diet is a key factor in exacerbating IBS symptoms and whether dietary manipulation is a valid treatment. The further studies are needed to evaluate the association between IBS and allergic disorders.},

Our aim was to examine the prevalence of IBS, whether there was a sex difference, and whether allergic diseases were important risk factors for IBS in young adults. METHODS: Newly enrolled university students completed health survey questionnaires regarding general health. Those with gastrointestinal symptoms completed the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and an additional questionnaire covering the presence of allergic manifestations. IBS was diagnosed based on the Rome II criteria. RESULTS: IBS was diagnosed in 268 of 2495 students [10.7%; constipation-predominant type (IBS-C), 128; diarrhea-predominant type (IBS-D), 117; unclassified, 23]. IBS-C was associated with female sex (odds ratio, 6.4; 95% confidence interval, 4.1-9.7; P < 0.001), whereas there was no sex difference in IBS-D. The proportions of subjects with food sensitivity were significantly different among the three groups (4.0%, subjects without IBS; 8.6%, IBS-C group; and 15.4%, IBS-D group) (P < 0.001). The median GSRS scores for pain (1.67 vs 1, P = 0.001), indigestion (1.75 vs 1.5, P < 0.001), and constipation (2.0 vs 1.33, P < 0.001) were higher, and the median diarrhea score was lower (1.33 vs 1.67) (P < 0.001), in women than in men. The median score for diarrhea (2.33 vs 1.67, P = 0.001) was significantly higher in subjects with food sensitivity than in those without. CONCLUSIONS: There was a strong relationship between IBS-C and female sex, and food sensitivity seemed to be an exacerbating factor for IBS-D.},

Whether this is affected by bowel habit, psychologic factors, or sex is unknown. METHODS: We included 61 patients with IBS (50 women, 11 men), 25 with diarrhea-predominant IBS, 17 with constipation-predominant IBS, 19 with alternating-type IBS, and 20 healthy controls (15 women, 5 men). A colonic distension trial was performed with a barostat before and after a 1-hour duodenal lipid infusion (3 kcal/min). Colonic thresholds, colonic tone, and the viscerosomatic referral pattern were assessed and compared between groups. Patients also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. RESULTS: The reduction in colonic pressure thresholds after vs before duodenal lipids was greater in patients than in controls for discomfort (P = .006) and pain (P < .0001). An increased viscerosomatic referral area for pain and discomfort during colonic distensions after vs before duodenal lipids was observed in patients but not in controls. The response was similar in IBS subgroups based on the predominant bowel habit, in patients with vs without anxiety and/or depression, and in women and men with IBS. The colonic tone response during lipid infusion was similar in IBS patients and controls, and in the different IBS subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: IBS patients show increased colonic sensitivity and altered viscerosomatic referral pattern after duodenal lipids. This response is largely unaffected by the predominant bowel habit, psychologic factors, or sex, but seems to be related to IBS per se.},

This article presents a productivity model demonstrating the indirect costs associated with IBS and the reduction in those costs for a cohort of female employees hypothetically treated with tegaserod, a new selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) type 4 (5-HT4) receptor agonist, which is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating women with IBS-C. The model is based on economic and epidemiologic published literature and clinical trial results. In this model, tegaserod treatment resulted in 1882 dollars in avoided lost productivity per treated female employee. Considering only the benefits of decreased work loss and the costs of medical therapy, the model predicts a benefit/cost ratio of 3.75 in the base case. From an employer's perspective, medical therapy for IBS with tegaserod is cost-effective under a series of assumptions for the treatment of women with IBS with constipation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to design a self-report measure of behavioural responses during the acute phase of an illness, in order to assess the importance of these behaviours in the development of ongoing medically unexplained syndromes. METHOD: An initial pool of items derived from theoretical models and clinical observation, was piloted on a group of 312 university students to assess the factor structure of the scale and the best fit items. The scale was further validated in a second study of 758 patients who were experiencing Campylobacter gastroenteritis. At 3 months post-infection, patients were sent a second questionnaire assessing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). RESULTS: Principal components analysis of the items in the student sample yielded a four-factor solution, labelled all-or-nothing behaviour, limiting behaviour, emotional support seeking and practical support seeking. The factor structure was confirmed in the Campylobacter sample, and internal reliability was good. All-or-nothing behaviour was associated with IBS at 3 months post-infection. In contrast, limiting behaviour and practical support seeking at the time of infection appeared to be protective. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that this is a valid and reliable measure that can predict the development of a medically unexplained syndrome after acute infection. Overdoing things at the time of infection and then needing to rest for prolonged periods (all-or-nothing behaviour), appears to be a particular risk factor for the development of IBS. Targeted interventions at the time of infection may improve coping and prevent symptoms from becoming chronic.},

   abstract = {Patients complaining of 'chronic diarrhoea' usually mean the passage of loose, urgent stools. Chronic diarrhoea is a feature of malabsorption; it may also be seen in the 'dumping syndrome' which follows gastric surgery, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, bile salt malabsorption and in malabsorption of simple sugars including most commonly lactose, fructose and sorbitol. Excessively rapid entry of chyme into the small or large intestine generates propulsive motor patterns leading to accelerated transit. Inflammation is associated with decreased normal mixing motor patterns but increased propulsive motility including high amplitude propagated contractions (HAPCs). Evidence for abnormal small intestinal motility in the diarrhoea associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is conflicting and any difference appears small. Increased colonic HAPCs with increased propulsion is seen in IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D). Stress-induced colonic motility is increased in IBS-D with hyper-responsiveness to corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF). Long-lasting increases in mucosal serotonin availability may contribute to the chronic diarrhoea seen in IBS-D and coeliac disease. Treatments for abnormal motility in chronic diarrhoea include those designed to correct specific underlying abnormalities including octreotide, antibiotics, colestyramine, specific food avoidance and anti-inflammatory agents. There are also treatments aimed primarily at altering motility directly including opiates, 5HT3 receptor antagonists and amitriptyline.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome patients form a heterogeneous group with a variable contribution of central and peripheral components. The peripheral component is prominent in irritable bowel syndrome developing after infection (post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome) and this has proved a profitable area of research. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have overthrown the dogma that irritable bowel syndrome is characterized by no abnormality of structure by demonstrating low-grade lymphocytic infiltration in the gut mucosa, increased permeability and increases in other inflammatory components including enterochromaffin and mast cells. Furthermore, increased inflammatory cytokines in both mucosa and blood have been demonstrated in irritable bowel syndrome. While steroid treatment has proved ineffective, preliminary studies with probiotics exerting an anti-inflammatory effect have shown benefit. SUMMARY: The study of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome has revealed the importance of low-grade inflammation in causing irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. It has suggested novel approaches to irritable bowel syndrome including studies of serotonin and histamine metabolism which may be relevant to other subtypes of the disease.},

Predictors of good prognosis include a short history, acute onset(possibly postinfective origin), absence of psychological disorders, and resolution of chronic life stressors. Possible-disease modifying treatments with long-lasting effects include diet and anti-inflammatory and psychological treatments. Dietary modifications, which often involve excluding dairy and wheat products, are successful in some patients. Anti-inflammatory treatments have been subjected to one RCT in postinfective IBS without benefit. Probiotics may have benefit in altering bacterial flora and as anti-inflammatory agents, but further trials are needed before they can be recommended. Psychological treatments may produce long-lasting responses. Relaxation therapy appears to have a nonspecific benefit. Psychotherapy has been shown to have long-term benefit and is particularly acceptable to, and effective for, those with overt psychological distress. Hypnotherapy has been shown to be effective in randomized placebo controlled trials and has a sustained effect.},

On the basis of a comprehensive dietary anamnesis, it is often possible to identify foodstuffs and eating behavior capable of aggravating the patient's symptoms. The underlying basic principle of treatment is that the gastrointestinal tract first undergo a temporary period of rest before being gradually re-accustomed to a biologically high-quality diet. A central approach includes various forms of fasting therapy, in particular in the case of severe conditions, which can usefully be supported by additional relaxation techniques, psychotherapy, hydrotherapy, massage and special manual techniques.},

A number of clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the effects in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms or by disturbances in the normal microflora. Gastrointestinal infections caused by Helicobacter pylori, traveller's diarrhoea, rotavirus diarrhoea, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile-induced diarrhoea are conditions that have been studied. There are also studies performed on the preventive effect of probiotics on radiation-induced diarrhoea and diarrhoea in tube-fed patients. Inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, two idiopathic conditions where alterations in the normal microflora have been implicated as responsible for initiation, are two further areas where the use of probiotics has been regarded as promising. The results from clinical studies have not been conclusive in that the effects of probiotics have been strain-dependent and different study designs have been used. Treatment of acute diarrhoea in children and prevention of AAD are the two most justified areas for the application of probiotics.},

However, only a few of the potential health benefits attributed to probiotics have been confirmed in well-designed, well-conducted, randomized, controlled trials. This is especially true in the pediatric population. We review here the available evidence on efficacy of probiotics in children in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. Although we restrict our analysis to the pediatric age, whenever potentially relevant information is available only from adult studies, they are examined as well. Probiotics have been most extensively studied in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, where their efficacy can be considered well established. Studies documenting effects in other childhood gastrointestinal illnesses are few, although some preliminary results are promising. Furthermore, only a limited number of probiotic strains have been tested, and, as the effects of different probiotic microorganisms are not equivalent, results cannot be generalized. Thus, at present, we have some positive certainties, lots of exciting promises and many unanswered questions.},

In 18 IBS patients (4 males, mean age 45+/-3.0 [SEM] years) and 19 healthy volunteers (6 males, mean age 41+/-3.5 years) blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) were assessed before, during and after consumption of a standardized meal. In pre- and postprandial phase Valsalva maneuver, cold pressor test (CPT) and deep breathing test were carried out and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for nausea, bloating and pain were obtained. In the IBS group, the meal induced significantly higher VAS scores for pain (P=0.002) and bloating (P=0.02). During food intake, the increase in blood pressure, heart rate and MSNA was equal in patients and controls, but the increase of LF/HF ratio of heart rate variability was significantly higher in the IBS group (median [quartiles] 2.29 [1.14-3.00] versus 0.77 [0.25-1.81]; P=0.03). IBS patients scored lower on pre- and postprandial RRmax/RRmin ratio during deep breathing (DB ratio, P=0.03). The increase in MSNA (burst frequency) in response to CPT tended to be higher in the IBS patients (P=0.07). We conclude that reactivity to food intake, measured as muscle sympathetic nerve activity, is normal in IBS patients. The lower DB ratio and higher LF/HF ratio during food intake in IBS patients is an indication of a reduced parasympathetic reactivity. These results suggest that reduced baseline activity as well as responsiveness of the parasympathetic system could play a role in the pathogenesis of IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Abdominal pain and discomfort are common symptoms in functional disorders and are attributed to visceral hypersensitivity. These symptoms fluctuate over time but the basis for this is unknown. Here we examine the impact of changes in gut flora and gut inflammatory cell activity on visceral sensitivity. METHODS: Visceral sensitivity to colorectal distension (CRD) was assessed at intervals in healthy mice for up to 12 weeks, and in mice before and after administration of dexamethasone or non-absorbable antibiotics with or without supplementation with Lactobacillus paracasei (NCC2461). Tissue was obtained for measurement of myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), histology, microbiota analysis, and substance P (SP) immunolabelling. RESULTS: Visceral hypersensitivity developed over time in healthy mice maintained without sterile precautions. This was accompanied by a small increase in MPO activity. Dexamethasone treatment normalised MPO and CRD responses. Antibiotic treatment perturbed gut flora, increased MPO and SP immunoreactivity in the colon, and produced visceral hypersensitivity. Administration of Lactobacillus paracasei in spent culture medium normalised visceral sensitivity and SP immunolabelling, but not intestinal microbiota counts. CONCLUSION: Perturbations in gut flora and in inflammatory cell activity alter sensory neurotransmitter content in the colon, and result in altered visceral perception. Changes in gut flora may be a basis for the variability of abdominal symptoms observed in functional gastrointestinal disorders and may be prevented by specific probiotic administration.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Few therapies are of proven efficacy in irritable bowel syndrome. Thus, there is great interest in the development of a natural therapy that can be both safe and effective. An understanding that probiotics are heterogeneous, with multiple targets and mechanisms of action, is fundamental to the development of clinical trials. RECENT FINDINGS: A bidirectional model for the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome is proposed in which gut-driven and brain-driven mechanisms contribute to the genesis of gut dysfunction and symptoms. In-vitro and animal studies have generated most of the mechanistic rationale for the use of probiotics in functional bowel disorders. A MEDLINE search of publications from 1989 to date revealed only eight placebo-controlled clinical trials on the subject of probiotics and irritable bowel syndrome. All these studies suffer from methodologic problems. By contrast, numerous reviews have been published in the past 2 years on this subject. SUMMARY: Animal research will continue to identify novel targets and elucidate the mechanisms of action of probiotics, thus providing a rational basis for their use in irritable bowel syndrome. The notion of treating irritable bowel syndrome with probiotics is particularly attractive to patients and generates great interest, although clinical evidence is not yet sufficient to enable clear guidelines to be designed. Large, well-designed, controlled clinical trials using specific probiotics are warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria exhibit a variety of properties, including immunomodulatory activity, which are unique to a particular strain. Thus, not all species will necessarily have the same therapeutic potential in a particular condition. We have preliminary evidence that Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 may have utility in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to confirm the efficacy of the probiotic bacteria B. infantis 35624 in a large-scale, multicenter, clinical trial of women with IBS. A second objective of the study was to determine the optimal dosage of probiotic for administration in an encapsulated formulation. METHODS: After a 2-wk baseline, 362 primary care IBS patients, with any bowel habit subtype, were randomized to either placebo or freeze-dried, encapsulated B. infantis at a dose of 1 x 10(6), 1 x 10(8), or 1 x 10(10), cfu/mL for 4 wk. IBS symptoms were monitored daily and scored on to a 6-point Likert scale with the primary outcome variable being abdominal pain or discomfort. A composite symptom score, the subject's global assessment of IBS symptom relief, and measures of quality of life (using the IBS-QOL instrument) were also recorded. RESULTS: B. infantis 35624 at a dose of 1 x 10(8) cfu was significantly superior to placebo and all other bifidobacterium doses for the primary efficacy variable of abdominal pain as well as the composite score and scores for bloating, bowel dysfunction, incomplete evacuation, straining, and the passage of gas at the end of the 4-wk study. The improvement in global symptom assessment exceeded placebo by more than 20% (p < 0.02). Two other doses of probiotic (1 x 10(6) and 1 x 10(10)) were not significantly different from placebo; of these, the 1 x 10(10) dose was associated with significant formulation problems. No significant adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: B. infantis 35624 is a probiotic that specifically relieves many of the symptoms of IBS. At a dosage level of 1 x 10(8) cfu, it can be delivered by a capsule making it stable, convenient to administer, and amenable to widespread use. The lack of benefits observed with the other dosage levels of the probiotic highlight the need for clinical data in the final dosage form and dose of probiotic before these products should be used in practice.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A disturbance in microbial balance of the gastrointestinal tract is often associated with diarrhea. Therefore, probiotics, as beneficial microorganisms for host health, have attracted clinical attention for their potential therapeutic application in the treatment of diarrhea. This review focuses on new research findings relevant to the effects of probiotics on diarrhea prevention and treatment and potential mechanisms of action for this alternative therapy for diarrhea. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical trials suggest potential beneficial effects of probiotic therapy for preventing and treating antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute diarrhea including rotavirus-induced diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. The most extensively studied probiotics for diarrhea are Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Saccharomyces, with potential mechanisms of therapeutic action based on the protection of intestinal epithelial cell and barrier function, prevention of enterotoxin binding to intestinal epithelial cells, and regulation of intestinal microbial environment. SUMMARY: Growing evidence suggests that probiotics may serve as a functional food in the treatment of diarrhea. Remaining challenges include identifying mechanisms of action to provide the basis of more refined hypothesis-driven clinical trials. The correct combination and concentration of probiotics applied to the appropriate gastrointestinal disorders may improve the efficacy of this approach for diarrhea and other diseases.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Food hypersensitivity is a common perception among irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Data from dietary elimination and food challenge studies support an etiopathological role of diet in IBS, but there are no well-established tests to identify food hypersensitivity. AIM: To compare IgG4 and IgE titers to common food antigens in IBS and controls. METHOD: One hundred and eight IBS [52 diarrhea-predominant (D-IBS); 32 constipation-predominant (C-IBS); 24 alternating (Alt-IBS)], and 43 controls were included in the study. IgG4 and IgE titers and skin prick testing (SPT) to 16 common foods including milk, eggs, cheese, wheat, rice, potatoes, chicken, beef, pork, lamb, fish, shrimps, soya bean, yeast, tomatoes, and peanuts were measured. RESULTS: IBS had significantly higher IgG4 titers (mug/L) to wheat (395 IQR +/- 1,011 vs 0 IQR +/- 285, p < 0.001), beef (1,079 IQR +/- 930 vs 617 IQR +/- 435, p < 0.001), pork (481 IQR +/- 379 vs 258 IQR +/- 496, p < 0.001), and lamb (241 IQR +/- 460 vs 167 IQR +/- 232, p= 0.009) compared to controls. These differences were maintained across all three subgroups. The antibody titers to potatoes, rice, fish, chicken, yeast, tomato, and shrimps were not significantly different. No significant difference in IgE titers was observed between IBS and controls. SPT was positive for only a single antigen in 5 of 56 patients tested with the same panel of foods. No correlation was seen between the pattern of elevated IgG4 antibody titers and patients' symptoms. CONCLUSION: Serum IgG4 antibodies to common foods like wheat, beef, pork, and lamb are elevated in IBS patients. In keeping with the observation in other atopic conditions, this finding suggests the possibility of a similar pathophysiological role for IgG4 antibodies in IBS.},

IgG4 antibodies to common food antigens are elevated in IBS. The aim of this article was to evaluate the effect of exclusion diet based on IgG4 titres on IBS symptoms and rectal sensitivity and compliance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study comprised 25 patients with IBS (3 M, 22 F, mean age 43 years, Rome II criteria). IgG4 titres to 16 foods (milk, eggs, cheese, wheat, rice, potatoes, chicken, beef, pork, lamb, soya bean, fish, shrimps, yeast, tomatoes and peanuts) were measured. Foods with titres >250 microg/l were excluded for 6 months. Symptom severity was assessed with a previously validated questionnaire at baseline, at 3 months and at 6 months. Rectal compliance and sensitivity were measured in 12 patients at baseline and at 6 months. RESULTS: IgG4 antibodies to milk, eggs, wheat, beef, pork and lamb were commonly elevated. Significant improvement was reported in pain severity (p < 0.001), pain frequency (p = 0.034), bloating severity (p = 0.001), satisfaction with bowel habits (p = 0.004) and effect of IBS on life in general (p = 0.008) at 3 months. Symptom improvement was maintained at 6 months. Rectal compliance was significantly increased (p = 0.011) at 6 months but the thresholds for urge to defecate/discomfort were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Food-specific IgG4 antibody-guided exclusion diet improves symptoms in IBS and is associated with an improvement in rectal compliance.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome is a common clinical condition that often presents a therapeutic challenge. There is no standard therapy and a multilevel approach is recommended. A high-fiber diet is often one of these components. Many investigators have studied the effectiveness of either fiber supplementation or bulking agents in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature on the use of fiber in irritable bowel syndrome and to provide some specific recommendations. Systematic reviews of these trials have generally not found fiber to be significantly more effective than placebo at relieving global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. There may be differences between results obtained with soluble and insoluble fiber. Adverse effects of fiber use may include abdominal discomfort and bloating. Although dietary fiber or bulking agents do not appear to be useful as sole treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, they may have a limited role in empiric therapy depending upon the patient's symptom complex, especially if constipation is the most significant symptom. The basic principles for using fiber therapy are to start with a low dose and increase slowly, to give an adequate trial and to evaluate the results early and periodically.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The influence of fungal colonization and probiotic treatment on the course of gastric ulcer (GU) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was not explored. Our studies included: 1) clinical investigation of 293 patients with dyspeptic and ulcer complaints and 72 patients with lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract: 60 patients with UC, 12 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - the control group. Significant fungal colonization (SFC), over 10(5) CFU/ml was evaluated. Mycological investigation was performed, including qualitative and quantitative examination, according to Muller method, 2) experimental studies in rats included estimation of the influence of inoculation of Candida isolated from human GI tract on the healing process of GU, induced by acetic acid with or without probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (10(6) CFU/ml) introduced intragastrically (i.g.). At 0, 4, 15 and 25 day after ulcer induction. Weight, damage area, gastric blood flow (GBF) (H2 clearance), expression of mRNA for cytokines IL-beta, TNF-alpha (ELISA) were evaluated. Mycology: qualitative and quantitative examination was performed. MPO serum activity was measured. Results of clinical studies: 1) SFC was more frequent in patients with GU: 54.2% of cases and patients with over 5 years history of UC: 33.3% cases. 2) SFC delayed GU healing and influenced the maintenance of clinical symptoms in both diseases. Results of animal studies: 3) In Candida inoculated rats, the GBF was significantly lower than in the vehicle controls (saline administered group). Upregulation of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta was recorded. The GUs were still present till 25 day in all rats inoculated with Candida, in contrast to vehicle group (reduction of ulcer in 92% at day 25). CONCLUSIONS: 1) Fungal colonization delays process of ulcer and inflammation healing of GI tract mucosa. That effect was attenuated by probiotic therapy. 2) Probiotic therapy seems to be effective in treatment of fungal colonization of GI tract. 3) Lactobacillus acidophilus therapy shortens the duration of fungal colonization of mucosa (enhanced Candida clearance is associated with IL-4, INF-gamma response).},
