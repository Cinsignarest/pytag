   abstract = {Colitis-associated cancer represents a long-standing problem, with two new factors adding to its importance: the diffusion of inflammatory bowel disease in developing countries, and the increased availability of effective drugs that control ulcerative colitis delaying or abrogating the need for a curative colectomy. The consolidated evidence that inflammation is the unique variable that factors in colitic cancer development has conferred impetus to the search and release of anti-inflammatory/immune suppressive molecules to pursue the goal of cancer chemoprevention. Cutting-edge research has provided breakthrough insights into the mechanism of the chemopreventive actions of mesalamines, thiopurines, and probiotics, and we expand on these topics. Despite these advancements, bedside evidence is still mixed and calls for further scrutiny. Nowadays, the clinician must continue to rely on classic preventive measures such as surveillance colonoscopy, and the early and aggressive use of drugs that permit to keep the degree of mucosal inflammation to a minimum.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the spectrum of colonic microflora in patients with colitis and if this could be altered with one month's treatment with synbiotics. METHODS: This was a pilot study in which patients were randomised to either receive a synbiotics preparation for a month and then "crossed over" to receive a placebo, or alternatively to receive the placebo first followed in the second month by synbiotic. Stool samples were collected on entry into the study and then at the end of first and second months respectively. Colonic microflora was measured by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the concentration of individual species. RESULTS: Sixteen patients completed the study of whom 8 had Crohn's colitis and 8 had ulcerative colitis. Their median age was 62 (IQR 50-65) years. An average of 22 terminal restriction fragments (T-RF's) was identified in each patient. Dice cluster analysis showed that each patient had a unique microbial composition which did not change significantly at different time points in the study, irrespective of whether they had probiotics or the placebo. Probiotic organisms were identified in stool samples but did not alter overall spectrum of microflora. In this pilot study we were unable to identify any specific characteristics related to nature of colitis. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that there is no difference in colonic microflora between patients with Crohn's or Ulcerative colitis and that the spectrum of bacteria was not altered by synbiotic administration.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: The human/microbiota cross-talk is partially mediated by bacteria-derived peptides like Serine-Threonine peptide (STp), which is resistant to gut proteolysis, is found in the human healthy colon and induces regulatory properties on gut dendritic cells (DCs); here we characterized human gut DC in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and studied the effect of STp on their properties. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human colonic DC from healthy controls and UC patients were isolated, conditioned for 24 h +/- STp and characterized by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Expression of immature DC markers DC-SIGN and ILT3, and Toll-like receptors were increased on gut UC-DC. Langerin (involved in phagocytosis), lymph node homing marker CCR7, and activation markers CD40/CD80/CD86 were decreased in UC. Gut DC had restricted stimulatory capacity for T-cells in UC. Conditioning of DC with STp in vitro reduced Toll-like receptor expression, increased CD40 and CD80 expression, and restored their stimulatory capacity. CONCLUSION: Colonic DCs display an abnormal immature phenotype in UC, which was partially restored following STp treatment. Bacteria-derived metabolites, like STp, seem to have a role in gut homeostasis that is missing in UC so they might lead a new era of probiotic products setting the basis for nondrug dietary therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are 2 common inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) associated with intestinal inflammation and tissue damage. Oxidative stress is suggested to play a major role in the initiation and progression of IBD. Vitamin C (ascorbate, ascorbic acid) supplementation has reduced oxidative stress in persons with IBD. The role of ascorbate transporters in IBD remains to be determined. SLC23A1 is a major ascorbate transporter in the intestinal tract, and some of its genetic variants have been associated with severely decreased ascorbate transport and lower systemic concentrations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether common genetic variants in the vitamin C transporter SLC23A1 are associated with the risk of IBD. DESIGN: Genomic DNA samples from patients with CD (n = 162) and UC (n = 149) from the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study and ethnically matched controls (n = 142) were genotyped for 3 SLC23A1 polymorphisms (rs6596473, rs33972313, and rs10063949) by using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Variation at rs10063949 (G allele for heterozygote and homozygote) was associated with increased susceptibility to CD (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.38, 4.66; OR: 4.72; 95% CI: 2.53, 8.81; P < 0.0001; respectively). A strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed across the SLC23A1 region (variation rs6596473 with rs10063949) for CD and UC (D' = 0.94 and 0.96, respectively). The risk alleles confirmed a haplotype (CGG) that is carried more in CD patients (65.3%, P < 0.0001) than in controls (43.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A genetic variant (rs10063949-G) in the SLC23A1 ascorbate transporter locus was identified and is associated with an increased risk of CD in a white Canadian IBD cohort. The presented evidence that SLC23A1 variations can modulate the risk of CD has implications for understanding ascorbate transport in CD patients and provides a novel opportunity toward individualized nutritional therapy for patients carrying the disease-associated genotype.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Dietary fats influence intestinal inflammation and regulate mucosal immunity. Data on the association between dietary fat and risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are limited and conflicting. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study cohorts. Diet was prospectively ascertained every 4 years using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Self-reported CD and UC were confirmed through medical record review. We examined the effect of energy-adjusted cumulative average total fat intake and specific types of fat and fatty acids on the risk of CD and UC using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 170,805 women, we confirmed 269 incident cases of CD (incidence 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 incident cases of UC (incidence 10/100,000 person-years) over 26 years and 3,317,338 person-years of follow-up. Cumulative energy-adjusted intake of total fat, saturated fats, unsaturated fats, n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were not associated with risk of CD or UC. However, greater intake of long-chain n-3 PUFAs was associated with a trend towards lower risk of UC (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01). In contrast, high long-term intake of trans-unsaturated fatty acids was associated with a trend towards an increased incidence of UC (HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.92). CONCLUSIONS: A high intake of dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs may be associated with a reduced risk of UC. In contrast, high intake of trans-unsaturated fats may be associated with an increased risk of UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Increased intake of dietary fiber has been proposed to reduce the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]). However, few prospective studies have examined associations between long-term intake of dietary fiber and risk of incident CD or UC. METHODS: We collected and analyzed data from 170,776 women, followed up over 26 years, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, followed up for 3,317,425 person-years. Dietary information was prospectively ascertained via administration of a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire every 4 years. Self-reported CD and UC were confirmed through review of medical records. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for potential confounders, were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: We confirmed 269 incident cases of CD (incidence, 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 cases of UC (incidence, 10/100,000 person-years). Compared with the lowest quintile of energy-adjusted cumulative average intake of dietary fiber, intake of the highest quintile (median of 24.3 g/day) was associated with a 40% reduction in risk of CD (multivariate HR for CD, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.90). This apparent reduction appeared to be greatest for fiber derived from fruits; fiber from cereals, whole grains, or legumes did not modify risk. In contrast, neither total intake of dietary fiber (multivariate HR, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.17) nor intake of fiber from specific sources appeared to be significantly associated with risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: Based on data from the Nurses' Health Study, long-term intake of dietary fiber, particularly from fruit, is associated with lower risk of CD but not UC. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms that mediate this association.},

This article reviews the currently available therapies for ulcerative colitis and the specific use of these therapies in the management of patients in different settings, particularly the difficult-to-treat patients. The focus of this review is on adalimumab, which has recently obtained approval by the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration, for use in treating adult patients with moderate-to-severe, active ulcerative colitis, who are refractory, intolerant, or who have contraindications to conventional therapy, including corticosteroids and thiopurines. Since the results emerging from the pivotal trials have been subject to some debate, the aim of this review was to summarize all available data on the use of adalimumab in ulcerative colitis, focusing also on a retrospective series of real-life experiences. Taken together, the current evidence indicates that adalimumab is effective for the treatment of patients with different types of ulcerative colitis, including biologically naive and difficult-to-treat patients.},

Better understanding of the pathogenesis of UC has led to the development of novel therapeutic agents that target specific mediators of the inflammatory cascade. A number of biological agents have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of UC and several more are currently in various phases of drug development. The commonly used agents include TNFalpha antagonists (e.g. infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab) and anti-integrin agents (vedolizumab). These biological agents have profoundly influenced the management of UC patients, especially those with refractory disease.

   abstract = {Dysregulated recruitment of leukocytes into the intestine is a characteristic feature of IBD. Several families of molecules regulate the influx of these cells into sites of inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract. Pharmacological blockade of interactions between molecules that mediate the formation of stable bonds (integrins) and their endothelial ligands has already shown clinical efficacy. Antibodies that target participant molecules have been approved by the US Federal Drug Administration for use in Crohn's, multiple sclerosis (MS) (i.e. natalizumab) and psoriasis (i.e. efalizumab). A more recent additional family of drugs, which might also interfere with lymphocyte traffic (i.e. sphingosine-1- phosphate receptor agonists: fingolimod) is in clinical use for MS and just recently entered the clinical trial stage for ulcerative colitis. In the present review we discuss basic aspects of clinically relevant molecules and compile the clinical studies that support the targeting of specific steps of the leukocyte adhesion cascade for therapeutic purposes in IBD.},

   abstract = {Pouchitis is a common complication seen in patients with ulcerative colitis who undergo total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis. Bacteria seem to play an important role in the development of pouchitis, although this role is not well defined. Because technology has advanced, we are able to apply molecular techniques to describe the structure and function of the pouch microbial community. In recent years, several studies have been performed comparing the pouch microbiota in patients with ulcerative colitis with healthy pouches and pouchitis. Many of these studies have suggested that pouchitis is characterized by dysbiosis and/or decreased microbial diversity. There has not been a clear pattern identifying a pathogenic organism or a group of organisms responsible for pouchitis. This review summarizes recent studies exploring the pouch microbiota in health and disease, the relationship of bacterial metabolites and pouchitis, and the role of antibiotics and probiotics for the treatment and prevention of pouchitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The probiotic bacterial strain Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is used for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), diarrhea and constipation. Its beneficial effects in the treatment of UC have been demonstrated in several controlled clinical studies; however, the mechanism of action on the cellular level is still not completely clear. The intracellular pattern recognition receptor NLRP3 is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC), activates caspase-1 within the inflammasome complex and has been implicated to play a role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases. METHODS: Probiotic EcN and commensal E. coli K12 were applied to IEC in vitro. Inflammasome activation, interleukin (IL)-18 release and caspase-1 activation were determined by coimmunoprecipitation, Western blot and ELISA. Apoptosis was investigated by Western blot. RESULTS: Incubation of Caco-2 cells with EcN resulted in lower inflammasome activation and subsequent secretion of mature IL-18 as compared to the commensal strain K12. Induction of apoptosis as determined by cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase were lower in EcN-stimulated cells. Autophagy was induced by both bacterial strains, but to a higher extent by K12. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that genetically very similar E. coli strains differ markedly in their ability to activate the inflammasome.},

   abstract = {In this work, we propose that for further studies of the physiopathology and treatment for inflammatory bowel diseases, an integral view of the conditions, including the triad of microbiota-heat shock proteins (HSPs)-probiotics, ought to be considered. Microbiota is the complex microbial flora that resides in the gut, affecting not only gut functions but also the health status of the whole body. Alteration in the microbiota's composition has been implicated in a variety of pathological conditions (e.g., ulcerative colitis, UC), involving both gut and extra-intestinal tissues and organs. Some of these pathologies are also associated with an altered expression of HSPs (chaperones) and this is the reason why they may be considered chaperonopathies. Probiotics, which are live microorganisms able to restore the correct, healthy equilibrium of microbiota composition, can ameliorate symptoms in patients suffering from UC and modulate expression levels of HSPs. However, currently probiotic therapy follows ex-adiuvantibus criteria, i.e., treatments with beneficial effects but whose mechanism of action is unknown, which should be changed so the probiotics needed in each case are predetermined on the basis of the patient's microbiota. Consequently, efforts are necessary to develop diagnostic tools for elucidating levels and distribution of HSPs and the microbiota composition (microbiota fingerprint) of each subject and, thus, guide specific probiotic therapy, tailored to meet the needs of the patient. Microbiota fingerprinting ought to include molecular biology techniques for sequencing highly conserved DNA, e.g., genes encoding 16S RNA, for species identification and, in addition, quantification of each relevant microbe.},

   abstract = {The dysbiosis theory of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) posits that there is an alteration in the gut microbiome as an important underpinning of disease etiology. It stands to reason then, that administering agents that could impact on the balance of microbes on the gut could be impactful on the course of IBD. Herein is a review of the controlled trials undertaken to assess the use of antibiotics that would kill or suppress potentially injurious microbes, probiotics that would overpopulate the gut with potentially beneficial microbes or prebiotics that provide a metabolic substrate that enhances the growth of potentially beneficial microbes. With regard to antibiotics, the best data are for the use of nitroimadoles postoperatively in Crohn's disease (CD) to prevent disease recurrence. Otherwise, the data are limited with the regard to any lasting benefit of antibiotics sustaining remission in either CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). A recent meta-analysis concluded that antibiotics are superior to placebo at inducing remission in CD or UC, although the meta-analysis grouped a variety of antibiotics with different spectra of activity. Despite the absence of robust clinical trial data, antibiotics are widely used to treat perineal fistulizing CD and acute and chronic pouchitis. Probiotics have not been shown to have a beneficial role in CD. However, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 has comparable effects to low doses of mesalamine in maintaining remission in UC. VSL#3, a combination of 8 microbes, has been shown to have an effect in inducing remission in UC and preventing pouchitis. Prebiotics have yet to be shown to have an effect in any form of IBD, but to date controlled trials have been small. The use of antibiotics should be balanced against the risks they pose. Even probiotics may pose some risk and should not be assumed to be innocuous especially when ingested by persons with a compromised epithelial barrier. Prebiotics may not be harmful but may cause gastrointestinal side effects. Finally, the timing of ingestion of antibiotics and other dietary factors that may function as prebiotics, especially in early childhood, may be critical in shaping the gut microbiome and ultimately predisposing to or preventing IBD. Finding ways to impact on the gut microbiome to alter the course of IBD makes good sense, but should be undertaken in the setting of rigorously performed controlled trials to ensure that the interventions are truly effective and well tolerated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been a dramatic increase in investigations on the potential mechanistic role of the intestinal microbiota in various diseases and factors modulating intestinal microbial composition. We recently reported on intestinal microbial shifts after smoking cessation in humans. In this study, we aimed to conduct further microbial analyses and verify our previous results obtained by pyrosequencing using a direct quantitative microbial approach. METHODS: Stool samples of healthy smoking human subjects undergoing controlled smoking cessation during a 9-week observational period were analyzed and compared with 2 control groups, ongoing smoking and nonsmoking subjects. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was applied to quantify specific bacterial groups. RESULTS: Intestinal microbiota composition was substantially altered after smoking cessation as characterized by an increase in key representatives from the phyla of Firmicutes (Clostridium coccoides, Eubacterium rectale, and Clostridium leptum subgroup) and Actinobacteria (HGC bacteria and Bifidobacteria) as well as a decrease in Bacteroidetes (Prevotella spp. and Bacteroides spp.) and Proteobacteria (beta- and gamma-subgroup of Proteobacteria). CONCLUSIONS: As determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, an independent direct quantitative microbial approach, we could confirm that intestinal microbiota composition in humans is influenced by smoking. The characteristics of observed microbial shifts suggest a potential mechanistic association to alterations in body weight subsequent to smoking cessation. More importantly, regarding previously described microbial hallmarks of dysbiosis in inflammatory bowel diseases, a variety of observed microbial alterations after smoking cessation deserve further consideration in view of the divergent effect of smoking on the clinical course of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A significant fraction of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) is not sufficiently controlled with conventional therapy or suffers from therapy related side effects. Anthocyanins, highly abundant in bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus), were shown to have antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. We aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of bilberries in active UC. METHODS: In an open pilot trial with a total follow-up of 9 weeks the effect of a daily standardized anthocyanin-rich bilberry preparation was tested in 13 patients with mild to moderate UC. Clinical, biochemical, endoscopic and histologic parameters were assessed. RESULTS: At the end of the 6 week treatment interval 63.4% of patients achieved remission, the primary endpoint, while 90.9% of patients showed a response. In all patients a decrease in total Mayo score was detected (mean: 6.5 and 3.6 at screening and week 7, respectively; p<0.001). Fecal calprotectin levels significantly decreased during the treatment phase (baseline: mean 778 mug/g, range 192-1790 mug/g; end of treatment: mean 305 mug/g, range <30-1586 mug/g; p=0.049), including 4 patients achieving undetectable levels at end of treatment. A decrease in endoscopic Mayo score and histologic Riley index confirmed the beneficial effect. However, an increase of calprotectin levels and disease activity was observed after cessation of bilberry intake. No serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the promising therapeutic potential of a standardized anthocyanin-rich bilberry preparation in UC in humans. These results clearly indicate a therapeutic potential of bilberries in UC. Further studies on mechanisms and randomized clinical trials are warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Monitoring of mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is of major importance. New noninvasive markers for intestinal inflammation are needed. Previous studies have reported that pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) correlates with clinical activity in IBD subgroups. Our aim was to investigate the correlation of serum and fecal PAP with clinical and biochemical parameters of disease activity in a real-life IBD cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and five consecutive IBD patients were enrolled. Clinical disease activity was scored by the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index; also, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and fecal calprotectin were determined. As surrogate for endoscopy, a combination score of clinical indices with CRP or calprotectin was used to define active disease. Fecal and serum PAP were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: The median serum and fecal PAP did not differ in Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with active compared with inactive disease according to clinical activity indices. Defining active disease by a combination score of Harvey-Bradshaw Index of more than 4 and CRP of more than 5 mg/l or calprotectin more than 250 microg/g, serum PAP (P=0.01), but not fecal PAP (P=0.32), was significantly higher in active than inactive CD patients. Area under the curve of the corresponding receiver operating curve (ROC) was 0.64. No differences were found in serum or fecal PAP levels using the combination score for active disease in UC. CONCLUSION: Serum but not fecal PAP was higher in active compared with nonactive CD and may reflect mucosal inflammation in CD, but not in UC. However, the accuracy of serum PAP for the diagnosis of active disease was poor, and therefore, serum PAP does not seem to have additional value compared with the current noninvasive markers.},

   abstract = {Gut microbiota is more and more important since metagenomic research have brought new knowledge on this topic especially for human health. Firstly, gut microbiota is a key element for our organism he lives in symbiosis with. Secondly, it interacts favorably with many physiological functions of our organism. Thirdly, at the opposite, it can be an active participant in intestinal pathologies linked to a dysbiosis mainly in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis but also in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and more prudently in autism and behavioral disorders. In order to keep a good health, it is essential to protect our gut microbiota as soon as our young age and maintain it healthy. Face to a more and more important number of publications for treating certain digestive diseases with fecal microbial transplantation, it needs to be very careful and recommend further studies in order to assess risks and define standardized protocols. Gut microbiota metabolic capacities towards xenobiotics need to be developed, and we must take an interest in the modifications they induce on medicinal molecules. On the other hand, it is essential to study the potent effects of pesticides and other pollutants on microbiota functions.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Calcium deficiency is considered a risk factor for the development of osteoporosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Various dietary restrictions, including milk products are reported by these patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate dairy product and dietary calcium intake by IBD patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 65 outpatients with IBD recruited from one reference center for IBD. A semi-structured questionnaire (to collect demographic, socioeconomic and clinical data) and a quantitative food frequency questionnaire were administered. With regard to clinical data, we evaluated the anthropometric nutritional status, the disease classification, the disease activity index and the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Self-reported modifications in the use of dairy products were evaluated. RESULTS: The IBD patients' ages ranged from 20-75 years and 67.0% were diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. The majority (64.7%) reported restricting dairy products. The frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms was higher among the Crohn's disease patients who restricted dairy products than among those with no restrictions (100% vs 42.9%; p = 0.013); this result was not observed among the UC (ulcerative colitis) patients. Disease activity was also more frequent in the IBD patients who restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (23.8% vs 4.5%; p = 0.031), and among the UC patients, extensive disease was more common in the patients who restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (42.9% vs 20.0%; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Restricting dairy products is common among IBD patients, possibly due to disease activity, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the extension of the disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), namely Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are lifelong chronic disorders arising from interactions among genetic, immunological and environmental factors. Although the origin of IBDs is closely linked to immune response alterations, which governs most medical decision-making, recent findings suggest that gut microbiota may be involved in IBD pathogenesis. Epidemiologic evidence and several studies have shown that a dysregulation of gut microbiota (i.e., dysbiosis) may trigger the onset of intestinal disorders such as IBDs. Animal and human investigations focusing on the microbiota-IBD relationship have suggested an altered balance of the intestinal microbial population in the active phase of IBD. Rigorous microbiota typing could, therefore, soon become part of a complete phenotypic analysis of IBD patients. Moreover, individual susceptibility and environmental triggers such as nutrition, medications, age or smoking could modify bacterial strains in the bowel habitat. Pharmacological manipulation of bowel microbiota is somewhat controversial. The employment of antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics has been widely addressed in the literature worldwide, with the aim of obtaining positive results in a number of IBD patient settings, and determining the appropriate timing and modality of this intervention. Recently, novel treatments for IBDs, such as fecal microbiota transplantation, when accepted by patients, have shown promising results. Controlled studies are being designed. In the near future, new therapeutic strategies can be expected, with non-pathogenic or modified food organisms that can be genetically modified to exert anti-inflammatory properties.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing in Eastern Europe possibly due to changes in environmental factors towards a more "westernised" standard of living. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in exposure to environmental factors prior to diagnosis in Eastern and Western European IBD patients. METHODS: The EpiCom cohort is a population-based, prospective inception cohort of 1560 unselected IBD patients from 31 European countries covering a background population of 10.1 million. At the time of diagnosis patients were asked to complete an 87-item questionnaire concerning environmental factors. RESULTS: A total of 1182 patients (76%) answered the questionnaire, 444 (38%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 627 (53%) ulcerative colitis (UC), and 111 (9%) IBD unclassified. No geographic differences regarding smoking status, caffeine intake, use of oral contraceptives, or number of first-degree relatives with IBD were found. Sugar intake was higher in CD and UC patients from Eastern Europe than in Western Europe while fibre intake was lower (p<0.01). Daily consumption of fast food as well as appendectomy before the age of 20 was more frequent in Eastern European than in Western European UC patients (p<0.01). Eastern European CD and UC patients had received more vaccinations and experienced fewer childhood infections than Western European patients (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this European population-based inception cohort of unselected IBD patients, Eastern and Western European patients differed in environmental factors prior to diagnosis. Eastern European patients exhibited higher occurrences of suspected risk factors for IBD included in the Western lifestyle.},

   abstract = {After a short overview of the history of probiotics, the author presents the development of human intestinal microflora based on the newest genetic data and the microbiological features of main probiotics. The indications of probiotic administration have been defined and extended in recent years. The author reviews significant results of probiotic treatment in some gastrointestinal diseases based on meta-analytical data. Probiotics are useful in preventing and treating diarrhoea caused by antibiotics and Clostridium difficile caused diarrhoea. In the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, preparations containing certain Lactobacillus,Bifidobacterium strains or Saccaromyces boulardii could enhance by 5-10% the rate of successful eradication and reduce the incidence and severity of the side effects. Some symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and thus the quality of life can be improved by probiotics. Their beneficial effect in ulcerative colitis was proven, while in Crohn's disease has not yet been defined. The use of probiotics is not included in guidelines, with the exception of the Maastricht IV/Florence consensus. For each disease it is advisable to use probiotics containing strains only with proven beneficial effect. The efficiency of preparations containing mixed strains has not yet been properly investigated. The author reviews the rare but potentially serious side effects of probiotics. In Hungary, there are many probiotic preparations available which can be purchased in pharmacies without prescription: their use is more empirical than evidence-based. The European Food Safety Authority has recently rejected claims for probiotics to be classed as medicines given the lack of convincing evidence on the effects of probiotics on human health and well-being. Clearly, further research is needed to collect evidence which could be incorporated into the international guidelines.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dietary factors have been indicated to influence the pathogenesis and nature course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with their wide variances. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and clinical significance of 14 serum food specific immunoglobulin G (sIgG) antibodies in patients with IBD. METHODS: This retrospective study comprised a total of 112 patients with IBD, including 79 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 33 with ulcerative colitis (UC). Medical records, clinical data and laboratory results were collected for analysis. Serum IgG antibodies against 14 unique food allergens were detected by semi-quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Food sIgG antibodies were detected in 75.9% (60/79) of CD patients, 63.6% (21/33) of UC patients and 33.1% (88/266) of healthy controls (HC). IBD patients showed the significantly higher antibodies prevalence than healthy controls (CD vs. HC, P = 0.000; UC vs. HC, P = 0.001). However no marked difference was observed between CD and UC groups (P = 0.184). More subjects were found with sensitivity to multiple antigens (>/= 3) in IBD than in HC group (33.9% vs.0.8%, P = 0.000). Egg was the most prevalent food allergen. There was a remarkable difference in the levels of general serum IgM (P = 0.045) and IgG (P = 0.041) between patients with positive and negative sIgG antibodies. Patients with multiple positive allergens (>/= 3) were especially found with significant higher total IgG levels compared with sIgG-negative patients (P = 0.003). Age was suggested as a protective factor against the occurrence of sIgG antibodies (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates a high prevalence of serum IgG antibodies to specific food allergens in patients with IBD. sIgG antibodies may potentially indicate disease status in clinical and be utilized to guide diets for patients.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of short- and long-term Passiflora edulis peel intake on the antioxidant status, microbiota, and short-chain fatty acids formation in rats with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid-induced colitis using two "in vivo" experiments: chronic (prevention) and acute (treatment). The colitis damage score was determined using macroscopic and microscopic analyses. In addition, the antioxidant activity in serum and other tissues (liver and colon) was evaluated. Bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, aerobic bacteria and enterobacteria, and the amount of short-chain fatty acids (acetic, butyric, and propionic acids) in cecum content were counted. Differences in the colon damage scores were observed; P. edulis peel intake improved serum antioxidant status. In the treatment protocol, decreased colon lipid peroxidation, a decreased number of aerobic bacteria and enterobacteria, and an improvement in acetic and butyric acid levels in the feces were observed. An improvement in the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was observed in the prevention protocol. These results suggested that P. edulis peel can modulate microbiota and could be used as source of fiber and polyphenols in the prevention of oxidative stress through the improvement of serum and tissue antioxidant status.},

   abstract = {Non-specific inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn`s disease, is a chronic noninfectious inflammatory disease whose incidence is increasingly high, especially in the developed countries. Effective methods of its treatment and prevention of recurrences are still under investigation. Amongst the options to control effectively the inflammatory processes of the gastrointestinal tract are thiazolidinediones - peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists, whose beneficial effects on macroscopic and histopathological features of colitis have been confirmed in numerous studies. In the present study, possible effects of PPAR-gamma agonists rosiglitazone and troglitazone enhancing the resistance of colonic tissues to the damaging factor were examined and compared. Rats received the food with 0.01% rosiglitazone or troglitazone for 4 weeks; during the final 2 weeks, colitis-inducing 1.5% DSS (dextran sodium sulfate) was additionally administered in the drinking water. The large intestine specimens were microscopically evaluated and the levels of Th1- (IL-2, INF) and Th2-dependent (IL-4, IL-10) cytokines were determined in the serum and intestinal homogenates. Prophylactic treatment with rosiglitazone and troglitazone ameliorated colitis substantially down-regulating the microscopic inflammatory parameters. Rosiglitazone and troglitazone administered before the induction of colitis exerted comparable effects on colitis. Both substances significantly reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the levels of inflammation-limiting cytokines. We conclude that thiazolidinedione drugs are likely to be successfully used for therapy and prevention of non-specific bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet may have a role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. In previous studies, the associations between increased intakes of carbohydrates, sugar, starch, and inflammatory bowel disease are inconsistent. However, few prospective studies have investigated the associations between these macronutrients and incident Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: A total of 401,326 men and women were recruited between 1991 and 1998. At recruitment, dietary intakes of carbohydrate, sugar, and starch were measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored identifying participants who developed incident CD or UC. Cases were matched with 4 controls, and odds ratios were calculated for quintiles of total carbohydrate, sugar, and starch intakes adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, and smoking. RESULTS: One hundred ten participants developed CD, and 244 participants developed UC during follow-up. The adjusted odds ratio for the highest versus the lowest quintiles of total carbohydrate intake for CD was 0.87, 95% CI = 0.24 to 3.12 and for UC 1.46, 95% CI = 0.62 to 3.46, with no significant trends across quintiles for either (CD, P trend = 0.70; UC, P trend = 0.41). Similarly, no associations were observed with intakes of total sugar (CD, P trend = 0.50; UC, P trend = 0.71) or starch (CD, P trend = 0.69; UC, P trend = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of associations with these nutrients is in agreement with many case-control studies that have not identified associations with CD or UC. As there is biological plausibility for how specific carbohydrates could have an etiological role in inflammatory bowel disease, future epidemiological work should assess individual carbohydrates, although there does not seem to be a macronutrient effect.},

   abstract = {Individuals with ulcerative colitis face an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer and would benefit from early chemopreventive intervention. Results from preclinical studies in the mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis demonstrate that flat and polypoid colitis-associated dysplasias arise via distinct genetic pathways, impacted by the allelic status of p53. Furthermore, flat and polypoid dysplasias vary in their response to induction by the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and inhibition by 5-aminosalicylic acid, a common therapy for the maintenance of colitis patients. These data suggest that use of combination therapy is essential for the optimal inhibition of colitis-associated colorectal cancer.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Grape seed extract (GSE) constitutes a rich source of procyanidins. GSE has been demonstrated to exert encouraging anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer properties in experimental settings, although its effects on inflammation of the colon remain undefined. AIM: To determine the effects of GSE in a rat model of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) for ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged daily (days 0-10) with GSE (400 mg/kg). Ulcerative colitis was induced by substituting DSS (2 % w/v) for drinking water from days 5-10. A sucrose breath test was performed on day 11 to determine small bowel function and intestinal tissues were collected for histological analyses. Statistical analysis was by one-way or repeated-measures ANOVA and p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Compared to DSS-treated controls, GSE significantly decreased ileal villus height (14 %; p < 0.01) and mucosal thickness (13 %; p < 0.01) towards the values of normal controls. GSE reduced qualitative histological severity score (p < 0.05) in the proximal colon, although no significant effect was evident in the distal colon. However, GSE failed to prevent DSS-induced damage to the crypts of both colonic regions. Administration of GSE did not negatively impact metabolic parameters, nor did it induce any deleterious gastrointestinal side effects in healthy animals. CONCLUSIONS: GSE decreased the severity of selected markers of DSS-induced colitis in the distal ileum and proximal colon, suggesting the potential as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Future studies of GSE should investigate alternative delivery methods and treatment regimens, further seeking to identify the individual bioactive factors.},

   abstract = {To reduce medication for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), we need to establish the etiology of UC. The intestinal microbiota of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been shown to differ from that of healthy controls and abundant data indicate that it changes in both composition and localization. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is significantly higher in IBD patients compared with controls. Probiotics have been investigated for their capacity to reduce the severity of UC. The luminal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract are covered by a mucus layer. This normally acts as a barrier that does not allow bacteria to reach the epithelial cells and thus limits the direct contact between the host and the bacteria. The mucus layer in the colon comprises an inner layer that is firmly adherent to the intestinal mucosa, and an outer layer that can be washed off with minimal rinsing. Some bacteria can dissolve the protective inner mucus layer. Defects in renewal and formation of the inner mucus layer allow bacteria to reach the epithelium and have implications for the causes of colitis. In this review, important elements of UC pathology are thought to be the intestinal bacteria, gut mucus, and the mucosa-associated immune system.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a leading form of inflammatory bowel disease that involves chronic relapsing or progressive inflammation. As a significant proportion of UC patients treated with conventional therapies do not achieve remission, there is a pressing need for the development of more effective therapies. The human gut contains a large, diverse, and dynamic population of microorganisms, collectively referred to as the enteric microbiota. There is a symbiotic relationship between the human host and the enteric microbiota, which provides nutrition, protection against pathogenic organisms, and promotes immune homeostasis. An imbalance of the normal enteric microbiota composition (termed dysbiosis) underlies the pathogenesis of UC. A reduction of enteric microbiota diversity has been observed in UC patients, mainly affecting the butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which can repress pro-inflammatory cytokines. Many studies have shown that enteric microbiota plays an important role in anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory activities, which can benefit UC patients. Therefore, manipulation of the dysbiosis is an attractive approach for UC therapy. Various therapies targeting a restoration of the enteric microbiota have shown efficacy in treating patients with active and chronic forms of UC. Such therapies include fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, helminth therapy, and dietary polyphenols, all of which can alter the abundance and composition of the enteric microbiota. Although there have been many large, randomized controlled clinical trials assessing these treatments, the effectiveness and safety of these bacteria-driven therapies need further evaluation. This review focuses on the important role that the enteric microbiota plays in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and discusses new therapeutic strategies targeting the enteric microbiota for UC.},

A growing body of research has proposed that probiotics are able to attenuate the inflammatory symptoms of these diseases in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism of probiotic actions remains unclear. RESULTS: Our results suggested Lactobacillus plantarum MYL26 inhibited inflammation in Caco-2 cells through regulation of gene expressions of TOLLIP, SOCS1, SOCS3, and IkappaBalpha, rather than SHIP-1 and IRAK-3. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed that live/ heat-killed Lactobacillus plantarum MYL26 and bacterial cell wall extract treatments impaired TLR4-NFkappab signal transduction through Tollip, SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 activation, thus inducing LPS tolerance. Our findings suggest that either heat-killed probiotics or probiotic cell wall extracts are able to attenuate inflammation through pathways similar to that of live bacteria.},

   abstract = {Curcumin is a phytocompound found in the root of turmeric, a common herbal ingredient in many Asian cuisines. The compound contains anti-inflammatory activity, which is mediated through an up-regulation of adiponectin and reduction of leptin. Consumption of curcumin was shown to prevent some deteriorative conditions caused by inflammation, such as ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and esophagitis, and so on. Inflammation-associated cardiovascular conditions such as atherosclerosis are common in diabetes patients. The anti-inflammation effect of curcumin might be beneficial to prevent such condition in these patients. We aim to evaluate an antiatherosclerosis effect of curcumin in diabetes patients. Effects of curcumin on risk factors for atherosclerosis were investigated in a 6-month randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical trial that included subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. An atherosclerosis parameter, the pulse wave velocity, and other metabolic parameters in patients treated with placebo and curcumin were compared. Our results showed that curcumin intervention significantly reduced pulse wave velocity, increased level of serum adiponectin and decreased level of leptin. These results are associated with reduced levels of homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance, triglyceride, uric acid, visceral fat and total body fat. In summary, a 6-month curcumin intervention in type 2 diabetic population lowered the atherogenic risks. In addition, the extract helped to improve relevant metabolic profiles in this high-risk population.},

   abstract = {VSL#3 probiotics can be effective on induction and maintenance of the remission of clinical ulcerative colitis. However, the mechanisms are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of VSL#3 probiotics on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in rats. Acute colitis was induced by administration of DSS 3.5 % for 7 days in rats. Rats in two groups were treated with either 15 mg VSL#3 or placebo via gastric tube once daily after induction of colitis; rats in other two groups were treated with either the wortmannin (1 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection or the wortmannin + VSL#3 after induction of colitis. Anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Expression of inflammatory related mediators (iNOS, COX-2, NF-kappaB, Akt, and p-Akt) and cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10) in colonic tissue were assessed. TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10 serum levels were also measured. Our results demonstrated that VSL#3 and wortmannin have anti-inflammatory properties by the reduced disease activity index and MPO activity. In addition, administration of VSL#3 and wortmannin for 7 days resulted in a decrease of iNOS, COX-2, NF-kappaB, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and p-Akt and an increase of IL-10 expression in colonic tissue. At the same time, administration of VSL#3 and wortmannin resulted in a decrease of TNF-alpha and IL-6 and an increase of IL-10 serum levels. VSL#3 probiotics therapy exerts the anti-inflammatory activity in rat model of DSS-induced colitis by inhibiting PI3K/Akt and NF-kappaB pathway.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biological agents are emerging treatment options for the management of ulcerative colitis (UC). PURPOSE: To assess the comparative efficacy and harm of biological agents in adult patients with moderately to severely active UC who are naive to biological agents. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library from inception through December 2013, without language restrictions, and ClinicalTrials.gov, European Medicines Agency, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration Web sites. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, placebo-controlled or head-to-head trials assessing biological agents as induction or maintenance therapy for moderately to severely active UC. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently abstracted study data and outcomes and rated each trial's risk of bias. DATA SYNTHESIS: There were no head-to-head trials. There were 7 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that were rated as low risk of bias and showed that all biological agents (adalimumab, golimumab, infliximab, and vedolizumab) resulted in more clinical responses, clinical remissions, and mucosal healings than placebo for induction therapy. The results of network meta-analysis suggested that infliximab is more effective to induce clinical response (odds ratio, 2.36 [95% credible interval, 1.22 to 4.63]) and mucosal healing (odds ratio, 2.02 [95% credible interval, 1.13 to 3.59]) than adalimumab. No other indirect comparison reached statistical significance. For maintenance, 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that were rated high risk of bias showed that all biological agents have greater clinical efficacy than placebo. The occurrence of adverse events was not different between biological agents and placebo. LIMITATION: Few trials, no head-to-head comparisons, and inadequate follow-up in maintenance trials. CONCLUSION: Biological agents are effective treatments for UC, but head-to-head trials are warranted to establish the best therapeutic option.},

   abstract = {Increased understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) has led to new therapeutic strategies. One of these is to target the molecules that regulate interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells at sites of inflammation (mainly leukocyte integrins and endothelial cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily). These molecules have been validated as therapeutic targets for IBD; several have shown efficacy, and 2 have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of IBD. Natalizumab, the first anti-integrin antibody tested for treatment of IBD, blocks the alpha4 subunit. Although it is effective, its clinical use has been limited by its association with risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Other, allegedly more selective drugs that affect leukocyte recruitment in the gastrointestinal tract have been developed or are under investigation and could increase safety. These include vedolizumab and AMG 181 (antibodies against alpha4beta7), etrolizumab (anti-beta7), and PF-00547659 (anti-mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1). Other agents have been developed to block alpha4 (the small molecule AJM300), CCR9 (the small molecule CCX282-B), and CXCL10 (the antibody eldelumab). We review the scientific rationale for inhibiting interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells to reduce intestinal inflammation and analyze the clinical studies that have been performed to test these new molecules, with particular attention to safety. We propose an evidence-based clinical positioning of this class of drugs.},

While the development of the immune system and the establishment of the microflora take place during infancy young patients often have a more severe and extensive disease. The differences in composition and concentration of intestinal microbiota and aberrant immune responses towards the luminal bacteria prompted the concept of an 'ecological' approach to control the disease course. Probiotics, living, non pathogenic micro organisms with a beneficial effect on the host, and prebiotics, oligosaccharides promoting the growth of the beneficial microflora, have been studied to this effect. Results have so far been disappointing for Crohn's disease but encouraging for ulcerative colitis.

METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained from 40 HC, 83 patients with CD, 68 with UC and 13 with pouchitis. Disease activity was assessed in CD using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, in UC using the UC Disease Activity Index and in pouchitis using the Pouchitis Disease Activity Index. Metabolite profiles were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of metabolites identified in HC (54) was significantly higher than in patients with CD (44, p<0.001), UC (47, p=0.042) and pouchitis (43, p=0.036). Multivariate discriminant analysis predicted HC, CD, UC and pouchitis group membership with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs: pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate and nonanoate), and of some protein fermentation metabolites, were significantly decreased in patients with CD, UC and pouchitis. Hexanoate levels were inversely correlated to disease activity in CD (correlation coefficient=-0.157, p=0.046), whereas a significant positive correlation was found between styrene levels and disease activity in UC (correlation coefficient=0.338, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Faecal metabolic profiling in patients with IBD relative to healthy controls identified MCFAs as important metabolic biomarkers of disease-related changes.

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Dietary fatty acids may be involved in the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). Arachidonic acid (AA), an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is a precursor of the proinflammatory cytokines prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4, and its metabolism is competitively inhibited by oleic acid (OA). This study aimed to prospectively investigate whether AA is positively and OA is negatively associated with incident UC development, using data from 7-day food diaries. METHODS: A total of 25 639 men and women, aged between 40 and 79 years, from Norfolk, UK, were recruited into the prospective European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort between 1993 and 1997. At baseline, participants completed 7-day food diaries, checked by nutritionists using a database containing 11 000 foods and 55 000 portion sizes. The cohort was monitored until June 2004 to identify participants who developed UC. Each patient was matched for age and sex with four controls, and conditional logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios for AA and OA intakes, and UC association. RESULTS: Of the participants, 26 (58% men) developed incident UC (53% left sided) after a median follow-up time of 3.8 years (0.5-8.3 years). The highest AA tertile was positively associated with an odds ratio of 6.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-35.23], with a trend across tertiles [odds ratio (OR) 2.43, 95% CI 1.06-5.61, P=0.04]. The highest tertile of OA intake was inversely associated with a 0.03 OR for UC (95% CI 0.002-0.56) and an inverse trend (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.90, P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Dietary AA was positively and OA was inversely associated with UC development, with large effect sizes in a dose-dependent manner. This supports roles for measuring these nutrients in future etiological studies and modifying intake in future interventional studies in patients with established disease.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by impaired mineralization of the bone matrix. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption syndromes may cause osteomalacia. This is a case of a patient with a 6-year history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's disease who was admitted to our outpatient clinic with symptoms of osteomalacia. INTRODUCTION: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disease characterized by an impaired mineralization of the bone matrix, frequently caused by disorders in vitamin D or phosphate metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption syndromes (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and jejuno-ileal bypass for obesity) may cause osteomalacia. CASE REPORT: A 43-year-old male presented with fatigue, low back pain, and morning stiffness. He had a 6-year history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's disease. Laboratory findings revealed low serum calcium, low 25-hydroxy vitamin D3, normal phosphorus, elevated parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase levels. Radiographs revealed grade IV sacroiliitis and Looser zones. He was diagnosed with osteomalacia due to the malabsorption of vitamin D. His symptoms and signs were relieved with supplements of vitamin D and calcium. CONCLUSIONS: Osteomalacia should be considered in differential diagnosis when assessing low back pain in the patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamin D deficiency should be treated with vitamin D supplementation in patients with Crohn's disease to prevent osteomalacia.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors is unclear, whether related to concomitant thiopurines usage or due to the underlying inflammatory disease. We sought to review all cases of T-cell NHL reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in patients receiving TNF-alpha inhibitors for all approved indications and examine the risk of T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors in comparison with the use of thiopurines in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) was queried for all lymphomas following treatment with the following TNF-alpha inhibitors: infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, and their trade names. Full reports for T-cell NHL cases were identified using the Freedom of Information Act. In addition, T-cell NHL reported in patients IBD with the use of the thiopurines-azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and their trade names were also collected. A search of MEDLINE was performed for additional T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors or thiopurines, not reported to the FDA but available in published literature. The histological subtypes of T-cell NHL reported with TNF-alpha inhibitors were compared with reported subtypes in Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) -17 registry. Reported risk of T-cell NHL in IBD with TNF-alpha inhibitors, thiopurines, or concomitant use was calculated using Fisher's exact test using 5-aminosalicylates as control drugs. RESULTS: A total of 3,130,267 reports were downloaded from the FDA AERS (2003-2010). Ninety-one cases of T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors were identified in the FDA AERS and nine additional cases were identified on MEDLINE search. A total of 38 patients had rheumatoid arthritis, 36 cases had Crohn's disease, 11 had psoriasis, 9 had ulcerative colitis, and 6 had ankylosing spondylitis. Sixty-eight of the cases (68%) involved exposure to both a TNF-alpha inhibitor and an immunomodulator (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, leflunomide, or cyclosporine). Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) was the most common reported subtype, whereas mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome and HSTCL were identified as more common with TNF-alpha-inhibitor exposure compared with SEER-17 registry. Nineteen cases of T-cell NHL with thiopurines were identified in the FDA AERS and one additional case on MEDLINE. Reported risk of T-cell NHL was higher with TNF-alpha inhibitor use in combination with thiopurines (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.98-354.09; P<0.0001) and thiopurines alone (95% CI 8.32-945.38; P<0.0001) but not with TNF-alpha inhibitor use alone (95% CI 0.13-10.61; P=1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Risk of T-cell NHL is increased with TNF-alpha inhibitor use in combination with thiopurines but not with TNF-alpha inhibitors alone.},

   abstract = {Accumulating evidence implicates defective innate immunity in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). Ineffectual NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2) is the most common susceptibility gene contributing to CD. Vitamin D (vD), a potent modulator of innate and adaptive immunity, induces NOD2 gene expression and its downstream function. We hypothesized that the hormonal form of vD (1,25D) could beneficially modulate innate immune function in CD. Using peripheral mononuclear cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) from CD, it was found that 1,25D decreased Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced cytokine production and enhanced cytokine levels induced by muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the NOD2 ligand. 1,25D increased the synergistic effect provided by NOD2 and TLR co-activation on interleukin (IL)-10, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Whereas 1,25D inhibits Mo-DC TLR-induced cytokines, co-stimulation of NOD2 results in increased IL-10 and IL-23. IL-12p70 was completely abrogated by 1,25D. 1,25D similarly modulated cytokine production by immune cells in ulcerative colitis patients and healthy controls. Mo-DCs from CD patients heterozygous for NOD2 mutations had a response similar to those from patients without NOD2 mutations. Immune cells from patients homozygous for the 1007 fs mutation were unresponsive to MDP and 1,25D. Our in vitro data support 1,25D as a potential modulator of immunity. However, these results cannot be extrapolated to CD patients without further controlled studies.},

   abstract = {A growing body of experimental and clinical evidence supports the hypothesis that the intestinal microbiota markedly influences function and the structure of the mucosal lining. Intestinal microbiota can potentially cause damage to the mucosa either directly by releasing toxins or indirectly by causing a detrimental immune response. Probiotic bacteria have been defined as live microorganisms, which when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit for the host. In recent years, the therapeutic and preventive application of probiotics for several gastrointestinal and liver disorders has received increasing attention. Probiotics appear to be beneficial for premature infants who suffer necrotizing enterocolitis. The effectiveness of certain probiotics as treatment for infectious and antibioticassociated diarrhea in adults and for allergic disorders in children has been supported by clinical studies; however, the potential mechanism( s) remains to be studied. Experimental studies and clinical trials for probiotic treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have yielded conflicting results. Daily intake of selected probiotics was effective in the prevention of ulcerative colitis and the attenuation of the active onset of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis but others failed to show a beneficial effect. The combination of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces boulardi and the treatment with Escherichia coli Nissle were found beneficial in inducing and maintaining remission of disease activity of gut inflammation and moderately severe ulcerative colitis. Probiotic bacteria were considered in some studies as a safe adjuvant when added to triple eradication therapy against the symptoms induced by the major gastric pathogen, Helicobacter pylori. This review attempted to overview these new exciting advances in the role of these microbes in the pathogenesis, management and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.},

   abstract = {Probiotic microorganisms have historically been used to rebalance disturbed intestinal microbiota and to diminish gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhea or inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). Recent studies explore the potential for expanded uses of probiotics on medical disorders that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, such as obesity, hypercholesterolemia, arterial hypertension, and metabolic disturbances such as hyperhomocysteinemia and oxidative stress. This review aims at summarizing the proposed molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in probiotic-host interactions and to identify the nature of the resulting beneficial effects. Specific probiotic strains can act by modulating immune response, by producing particular molecules or releasing biopeptides, and by modulating nervous system activity. To date, the majority of studies have been conducted in animal models. New investigations on the related mechanisms in humans need to be carried out to better enable targeted and effective use of the broad variety of probiotic strains.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Many species within the phylum Firmicutes are thought to exert anti-inflammatory effects. We quantified bacteria belonging to the genus Butyricicoccus in stools of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). We evaluated the effect of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum in a rat colitis model and analysed the ability to prevent cytokine-induced increases in epithelial permeability. DESIGN: A genus-specific quantitative PCR was used for quantification of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC or CD and healthy subjects. The effect of B pullicaecorum on trinitrobenzenesulfonic (TNBS)-induced colitis was assessed and the effect of B pullicaecorum culture supernatant on epithelial barrier function was investigated in vitro. RESULTS: The average number of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC and CD in active (UC: 8.61 log10/g stool; CD: 6.58 log10/g stool) and remission phase (UC: 8.69 log10/g stool; CD: 8.38 log10/g stool) was significantly lower compared with healthy subjects (9.32 log10/g stool) and correlated with disease activity in CD. Oral administration of B pullicaecorum resulted in a significant protective effect based on macroscopic and histological criteria and decreased intestinal myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-12 levels. Supernatant of B pullicaecorum prevented the loss of transepithelial resistance (TER) and the increase in IL-8 secretion induced by TNFalpha and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in a Caco-2 cell model. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have lower numbers of Butyricicoccus bacteria in their stools. Administration of B pullicaecorum attenuates TNBS-induced colitis in rats and supernatant of B pullicaecorum cultures strengthens the epithelial barrier function by increasing the TER.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The present study was aimed to determine the effect of Germinated Barley Foodstuff (GBF) administration on serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and clinical signs in patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC). METHODS: Forty-six patients were randomly allocated into GBF group and control group. Subjects in control group received only conventional drug therapy, while the GBF group received 30g GBF per day (3 times a day) by oral administration during 2 month along with routine medications. RESULTS: The mean serum CRP in the GBF group decreased significantly (P=0.017) compared with the baseline. Although the frequency of clinical signs including the number of episodes diarrhea, degree of visible blood in stool, degree of abdominal pain or cramping, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia decreased in the GBF group but it was statistically significant only in the case of abdominal pain and cramping. However, this reduction was only significant in the case of abdominal pain and cramping (P=0.016) CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of GBF along with the current medication may be efficient in attenuating the inflammation and clinical signs of UC patients.},

   abstract = {The beneficial effects of kolaviron, a natural biflavonoid from the seeds of Garcinia kola, have been attributed mainly to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. This study investigated these effects on dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis in rats. Sulfasalazine served as standard reference in this study. Kolaviron and sulfasalazine were separately co-administered orally at 200 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg, respectively, to dextran sulphate sodium-exposed rats for 5 days. The result indicated that kolaviron or sulfasalazine significantly prevented DSS-induced body weight loss as well as the incidence of diarrhoea and bleeding in DSS-exposed rats. Kolaviron suppressed the DSS-mediated increase in colonic nitric oxide concentration and myeloperoxidase activity and significantly prevented the increase in inflammatory mediators, interleukin-1beta and tumour necrosis factor alpha, in the colon of DSS-treated rats. The significant depletion in colonic antioxidant status in rats exposed to DSS alone was evident by marked reduction in colonic catalase and glutathione S-transferase activities as well as glutathione content, leading to elevated hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation levels. Histopathologically, DSS alone resulted in severe epithelial erosion, total absence of goblet cells, destruction of the crypts, necrotic and distorted glands, accompanied by marked cellular mononuclear cells infiltration. However, administration of kolaviron and sulfasalazine ameliorated DSS-induced colitis by increasing the antioxidant status decreased hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation levels and attenuated the adverse effect of DSS on colon architecture. In conclusion, the anti-colitis effect of kolaviron is related to its intrinsic anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a defective intestinal barrier and enhanced adaptive immune responses against commensal microbiota. Immune responses against food antigens in IBD patients remain poorly defined. METHODS: IgG and IgA specific for food and microfloral antigens (wheat and milk extracts; purified ovalbumin; Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis lysates; mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were analyzed by ELISA in the serum and feces of patients with Crohn's disease (CD; n = 52 for serum and n = 20 for feces), ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 29; n = 17), acute gastroenteritis/colitis (AGE; n = 12; n = 9) as well as non-inflammatory controls (n = 61; n = 39). RESULTS: Serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-B. fragilis IgG and IgA levels were increased in CD patients whereas antibody (Ab) levels against E. coli and food antigens were not significantly different within the patient groups and controls. Subgroup analysis revealed that CD patients with severe diseases defined by stricturing and penetrating lesions have slightly higher anti-food and anti-microbial IgA levels whereas CD and UC patients with arthropathy have decreased anti-food IgG levels. Treatment with anti-TNF-alpha Abs in CD patients was associated with significantly decreased ASCA IgG and IgA and anti-E. coli IgG. In the feces specific IgG levels against all antigens were higher in CD and AGE patients while specific IgA levels were higher in non-IBD patients. Anti-food IgG and IgA levels did not correlate with food intolerance. SUMMARY: In contrast to anti-microbial Abs, we found only minor changes in serum anti-food Ab levels in specific subgroups of IBD patients. Fecal Ab levels towards microbial and food antigens show distinct patterns in controls, CD and UC patients.},

However, the effects of probiotics on the induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) still remain controversial. This systematic review verified the findings of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated the therapeutic effects of probiotics on IBD. After the quality assessment, 20 RCTs which investigated the effects of probiotics on the induction or maintenance of remission in IBD were identified. From the results of the validation of these RCTs, beneficial effects of probiotic treatments to improve the response rate and remission rate on the remission induction therapies [risk ratio (RR) 1.81; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.40-2.35 and RR 1.56; 95 % CI 0.95-2.56, respectively] were verified. Furthermore, probiotic treatments exhibited effects equal to mesalazine on the maintenance of remission in UC (RR 1.00; 95 % CI 0.79-1.26). In contrast, no significant effect of probiotic treatments was shown in either the induction or maintenance of remission in CD. Because there were many variations in the conditions among these studies, a further analysis evaluating the effects of probiotic treatments in IBD is needed to clarify the optimal probiotics and treatment regimens for each condition or population in IBD patients.},

   abstract = {Innate immunity prevents pathogens from entering and spreading within the body. This function is especially important in the gastrointestinal tract and skin, as these organs have a large surface contact area with the outside environment. In the intestine, luminal commensal bacteria are necessary for adequate food digestion and play a crucial role in tolerance to benign antigens. Immune system damage can create an intestinal inflammatory response, leading to chronic disease including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an IBD of unknown etiology with increasing worldwide prevalence. In the intestinal mucosa of UC patients, there is an imbalance in the IL-33/ST2 axis, an important modulator of the innate immune response. This paper reviews the role of the IL-33/ST2 system in innate immunity of the intestinal mucosa and its importance in inflammatory bowel diseases, especially ulcerative colitis.},

TCE was further studied for its effects on various physical (mucus/blood in stool and stool frequency, food and water intake and body weight changes), histology, antibacterial activity and free radicals (NO and LPO), antioxidants (SOD, CAT and GSH) and myeloperoxidase in colonic tissue. Intra-colonic AA administration increased colonic mucosal damage and inflammation, mucus/bloody diarrhoea, stool frequency, but decreased body weight which were reversed by TCE and sulfasalazine (SS, positive control) treatments. TCE showed antibacterial activity and both TCE and SS enhanced the antioxidants, but decreased free radicals and myeloperoxidase activities affected in acetic acid-induced colitis. TCE indicated the presence of active principles with proven antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and free radical scavenging and healing properties. Thus, TCE seemed to be safe and effective in healing experimental colitis.},

Animal models consistently demonstrate that vitamin D significantly impacts on the modulation of astrointestinal inflammation, while epidemiological and observational data show an inverse relationship between vitamin D status and the onset/progression of Crohn's disease as well as the development of colorectal cancer. As vitamin D supplementation is readily available, at low cost, it is a very attractive potential therapeutic option. The biological plausibility for a role for vitamin D in inflammation modulation, the potential genetic links associated with vitamin D metabolism and the clinical aspects for it in IBD will be discussed.},

   abstract = {Clinically, excessive omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and inadequate omega-3 PUFA have been associated with enhanced risks for developing ulcerative colitis. In rodent models, omega-3 PUFAs have been shown to either attenuate or exacerbate colitis in different studies. We hypothesized that a high omega-6: omega-3 PUFA ratio would increase colitis susceptibility through the microbe-immunity nexus. To address this, we fed post-weaned mice diets rich in omega-6 PUFA (corn oil) and diets supplemented with omega-3 PUFA (corn oil+fish oil) for 5 weeks. We evaluated the intestinal microbiota, induced colitis with Citrobacter rodentium and followed disease progression. We found that omega-6 PUFA enriched the microbiota with Enterobacteriaceae, Segmented Filamentous Bacteria and Clostridia spp., all known to induce inflammation. During infection-induced colitis, omega-6 PUFA fed mice had exacerbated intestinal damage, immune cell infiltration, prostaglandin E2 expression and C. rodentium translocation across the intestinal mucosae. Addition of omega-3 PUFA on a high omega-6 PUFA diet, reversed inflammatory-inducing microbial blooms and enriched beneficial microbes like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, reduced immune cell infiltration and impaired cytokine/chemokine induction during infection. While, omega-3 PUFA supplementation protected against severe colitis, these mice suffered greater mortality associated with sepsis-related serum factors such as LPS binding protein, IL-15 and TNF-alpha. These mice also demonstrated decreased expression of intestinal alkaline phosphatase and an inability to dephosphorylate LPS. Thus, the colonic microbiota is altered differentially through varying PUFA composition, conferring altered susceptibility to colitis. Overall, omega-6 PUFA enriches pro-inflammatory microbes and augments colitis; but prevents infection-induced systemic inflammation. In contrast, omega-3 PUFA supplementation reverses the effects of the omega-6 PUFA diet but impairs infection-induced responses resulting in sepsis. We conclude that as an anti-inflammatory agent, omega-3 PUFA supplementation during infection may prove detrimental when host inflammatory responses are critical for survival.},

In this study, we assessed the impact of oral administration of B. infantis 35624, for 68 weeks on inflammatory biomarker and plasma cytokine levels in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 22), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) (n = 48) and psoriasis (n = 26) in three separate randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled interventions. Additionally, the effect of B. infantis 35624 on immunological biomarkers in healthy subjects (n = 22) was assessed. At baseline, both gastrointestinal (UC) and non-gastrointestinal (CFS and psoriasis) patients had significantly increased plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) compared with healthy volunteers. B. infantis 35624 feeding resulted in reduced plasma CRP levels in all three inflammatory disorders compared with placebo. Interestingly, plasma TNF-alpha was reduced in CFS and psoriasis while IL-6 was reduced in UC and CFS. Furthermore, in healthy subjects, LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was significantly reduced in the B. infantis 35624-treated groups compared with placebo following eight weeks of feeding. These results demonstrate the ability of this microbe to reduce systemic pro-inflammatory biomarkers in both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal conditions. In conclusion, these data show that the immunomodulatory effects of the microbiota in humans are not limited to the mucosal immune system but extend to the systemic immune system.},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate 25[OH] vitamin D levels in patients with IBD in remission or with mild activity. A second objective is to evaluate whether there are relationships within IBD family units of 25[OH] vitamin D and what are the influences associated with these levels. METHODS: Participants underwent medical history, physical examination and a 114 item diet questionnaire. Serum 25[OH] vitamin D was measured, using a radioimmunoassay kit, (replete >/= 75, insufficient 50-74, deficient < 25-50, or severely deficient < 25 nmol/L). Associations between 25[OH] vitamin D and twenty variables were evaluated using univariate regression. Multivariable analysis was also applied and intrafamilial dynamics were assessed. RESULTS: 55 patients and 48 controls with their respective families participated (N206). 25[OH] vitamin D levels between patients and controls were similar (71.2 +/- 32.8 vs. 68.3 +/-26.2 nmol/L). Vitamin D supplements significantly increased intake but correlation with serum 25[OH] vitamin D was significant only during non sunny months among patients. Within family units, patients' families had mean replete levels (82.3 +/- 34.2 nmol/L) and a modest correlation emerged during sunny months between patients and family (r2 =0.209 p = 0.032). These relationships were less robust and non significant in controls and their families. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild or inactive IBD 25[OH] vitamin D levels are less than ideal but are similar to controls. Taken together collectively, the results of this study suggest that patient family dynamics may be different in IBD units from that in control family units. However contrary to the hypothesis, intra familial vitamin D dynamics do not pose additional risks for development of IBD.},

   abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Many Chinese herbs are traditionally used as medicine to improve the functions of gastrointestinal tract. Some of these herbs are also promising agents for the improvement of the gut microbiota and the treatment of ulcerative colitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By screening seven traditional Chinese herbs, we found that Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis were the most effective in promoting the growth of probiotics including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in vitro. We then evaluated the effects of Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis on the growth of the bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella spp.) in vitro. In in vivo experiment, we gavage administrated trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid induced ulcerative colitis (UC) rats with Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis extracts. After two weeks treatment, we analyzed the structure of the gut microbiota and examined the UC symptoms by employing qPCR and animal pathology detection techniques. RESULTS: Both Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis promoted the growth of probiotics - Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in vitro. Red Ginseng also inhibited the growth of some pathogen strains. In vivo, Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis improved the structure of gut microbiota and relieved the symptoms of ulcerative colitis in vivo. Compared with Semen Coicis, Red Ginseng was more effective in relieving the symptoms of ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Red Ginseng could promote the growth of probiotic bacteria in vitro. Red Ginseng and, to a lesser extent Semen Coicis, gave positive results in an experimental in vivo model for ulcerative colitis.},

By contrast the prophylactic use of a probiotic mixture (VSL #3) appears to be able to prevent development of pouchitis.

   abstract = {SCOPE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon. alpha-Mangostin (alpha-MG), the most abundant xanthone in mangosteen fruit, exerts anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities in vitro. We evaluated the impact of dietary alpha-MG on murine experimental colitis and on the gut microbiota of healthy mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Colitis was induced in C57BL/6J mice by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Mice were fed control diet or diet with alpha-MG (0.1%). alpha-MG exacerbated the pathology of DSS-induced colitis. Mice fed diet with alpha-MG had greater colonic inflammation and injury, as well as greater infiltration of CD3(+) and F4/80(+) cells, and colonic myeloperoxidase, than controls. Serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, IL-6, and serum amyloid A were also greater in alpha-MG-fed animals than in controls. The colonic and cecal microbiota of healthy mice fed alpha-MG but no DSS shifted to an increased abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, a profile similar to that found in human UC. CONCLUSION: alpha-MG exacerbated colonic pathology during DSS-induced colitis. These effects may be associated with an induction of intestinal dysbiosis by alpha-MG. Our results suggest that the use of alpha-MG-containing supplements by patients with UC may have unintentional risk.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. The two main forms of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. According to the recent concept the disease is caused by a combination of factors, including genetics, immune dysregulation, barrier dysfunction and the change in microbial flora. Environmental factors, such as changes in diet, antibiotic use, smoking or improved domestic hygiene (e.g. eradication of intestinal helminths) probably contribute to the development and increased prevalence of IBD. Dysregulation of mucosal immunity in IBD causes an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines which resulted in uncontrolled intestinal inflammation. Based on extensive research over the last decade, besides the conventional therapy, there are several novel pathways and specific targets, on which focus new therapeutics. New therapeutics aim 1./ to correct genetic susceptibility by stimulating NOD2 expression, TLR3 signaling or inhibition of TLR4 pathway, 2./ to restore the immune dysregulation by inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21), Th1 polarisation (IL-2, IL-12, IL-23, IFN-gamma ), T-cell activation, leukocyte adhesion, as well as by immunostimulation (GM-CSF, G-CSF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-11, IFN-beta-1a), 3./ to restore mucosal barrier function and stimulate mucosal healing by different growth factors, such as GH, EGF, KGF, TGF-beta, VEGF, 4./ to restore the normal bacterial flora by antibiotics, probiotics. However, in spite of these numerous potential targets, the true value and clinical significance of most of the new biologics and molecules are not clear yet.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with its two major forms Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic relapsing disorders leading to inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the precise aetiology of IBD remains unclear, several factors are believed to contribute to disease pathogenesis. Among these, the role of the intestinal microbiota has become more and more appreciated. Evidence from experimental and clinical studies strongly suggests that chronic intestinal inflammation results from a dysregulated immune response towards components of the microbiota in genetically susceptible hosts. The growing perception of the microbiota as a major driver of disease pathogenesis raises the question, if the intestinal microbiota can be used as a therapeutic target in CD. Based on what we know about host microbiota interactions in health and disease, the objective of this review is to address the question if the microbiota holds the key to the future therapy in CD.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the colonic mucosa. Administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to animals is a frequently used model to mimic human colitis. Deregulation of the immune response to the enteric microflora or pathogens as well as increased intestinal permeability have been proposed as disease-driving mechanisms. To enlarge the understanding of the pathogenesis, we have studied the effect of DSS on the immune system and gut microbiota in mice. Intestinal inflammation was verified through histological evaluation and myeloperoxidase activity. Immunological changes were assessed by flow cytometry in spleen, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes and through multiplex cytokine profiling. In addition, quantification of the total amount of bacteria on colonic mucosa as well as the total amount of lactobacilli, Akkermansia, Desulfovibrio and Enterobacteriaceae was performed by the use of quantitative PCR. Diversity and community structure were analysed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) patterns, and principal component analysis was utilized on immunological and T-RFLP patterns. DSS-induced colitis show clinical and histological similarities to UC. The composition of the colonic microflora was profoundly changed and correlated with several alterations of the immune system. The results demonstrate a relationship between multiple immunological changes and alterations of the gut microbiota after DSS administration. These data highlight and improve the definition of the immunological basis of the disease and suggest a role for dysregulation of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease would benefit from specific targeting of therapeutics to the intestine. We developed a strategy for localized delivery of the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-27, which is synthesized actively in situ by the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis (LL-IL-27), and tested its ability to reduce colitis in mice. METHODS: The 2 genes encoding mouse IL-27 were synthesized with optimal codon use for L lactis and joined with a linker; a signal sequence was added to allow for product secretion. The construct was introduced into L lactis. Colitis was induced via transfer of CD4(+)CD45RB(hi) T cells into Rag(-/-) mice to induce colitis; 7.5 weeks later, LL-IL-27 was administered to mice via gavage. Intestinal tissues were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: LL-IL-27 administration protected mice from T-cell transfer-induced enterocolitis and death. LL-IL-27 reduced disease activity scores, pathology features of large and small bowel, and levels of inflammatory cytokines in colonic tissue. LL-IL-27 also reduced the numbers of CD4(+) and IL-17(+) T cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissue. The effects of LL-IL-27 required production of IL-10 by the transferred T cells. LL-IL-27 was more effective than either LL-IL-10 or systemic administration of recombinant IL-27 in reducing colitis in mice. LL-IL-27 also reduced colitis in mice after administration of dextran sodium sulfate. CONCLUSIONS: LL-IL-27 reduces colitis in mice by increasing the production of IL-10. Mucosal delivery of LL-IL-27 could be a more effective and safer therapy for inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The interaction between a disturbed microbial composition, the intestinal mucosal barrier and the mucosal immune system plays an important role in IBD and its chronicity. It has been indicated that due to the altered microbial composition the balance between T regulatory cells (Treg) and T helper cells (Th) 17 is disturbed, leading to an inflammatory state. The present study shows that oral intake of a specific multi fibre mix (MF), designed to match the fibre content of a healthy diet, counteracts IBD-like intestinal inflammation and weight loss in dextran sodium sulphate treated mice. This reduction in inflammation might be brought about, at least in part, by the MF-induced decrease in inflammatory cytokines, increase in IL-10 and the relative increase in Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Moreover, the Treg percentage in the MLN correlates with the percentage of tolerogenic lamina propria derived CD103+RALDH+dendritic cells in the MLN, suggesting that these play a role in the observed effects. In children with CD exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a widely used safe and effective therapy. Optimizing enteral nutritional concepts with the tested fibre mix, know to modulate the gut microbiota composition, SCFA production and inflammatory status (as indicated by the present study) could possibly further improve efficacy in inducing remission.},

Our aim of the present work has been to explore the levels of antibodies (IgG and IgA) raised against extracellular proteins produced by LAB and its association with IBD. We analyzed, by Western-blot and ELISA, the presence of serum antibodies (IgA and IgG) developed against extracellular protein fractions produced by different food bacteria from the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. We used a sera collection consisting of healthy individuals (HC, n = 50), Crohn's disease patients (CD, n = 37), and ulcerative colitis patients (UC, n = 15). Levels of IgA antibodies developed against a cell-wall hydrolase from Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus GG (CWH) were significantly higher in the IBD group (P < 0.002; n = 52). The specificity of our measurements was confirmed by measuring IgA antibodies developed against the CWH peptide 365-VNTSNQTAAVSAS-377. IBD patients appeared to have different immune response to food bacteria. This paper sets the basis for developing systems for early detection of IBD, based on the association of high levels of antibodies developed against extracellular proteins from food and probiotic bacteria.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are caused by the failure of immunoregulatory mechanisms due to external environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals. Probiotics and prebiotics could be used in prevention and therapy of many disorders of gastrointestinal tract including ulcerative colitis. Probiotics are living microorganisms with good tolerability and minimal risk, which confer a health benefit for the host when administered in adequate amounts. Their effect is closely related to maintaining the natural function of the intestinal flora. In this respect, they are indispensable prebiotics to protect or reduce the incidence of inflammatory lesions in diseases of the digestive tract. CONCLUSION: Ingestion of probiotics and prebiotics may provide some clues in developing a new class of therapeutic agents for the treatment/ prevention of IBD and colitis-associated cancer (CAC) in the future (Tab. 2, Ref. 26).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: The pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus (Tac) differ among individuals, and genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1 are thought to be involved. The aim of this study was to clarify whether these genetic polymorphisms affect the pharmacokinetics of Tac in patients with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: The subjects in this study were 45 patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis who were resistant to other therapies and were treated with Tac. The subjects were tested for genetic polymorphisms of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1, and the relationship between Tac pharmacokinetics and the remission rate was investigated. RESULTS: Of the 45 subjects, 24 (53.3%) were CYP3A5 expressers (Exp), and 21 (46.7%) were non-expressers (Non-Exp). The trough level and the dose-adjusted trough level on days 2-5 were significantly higher in the Non-Exp group than in the Exp group (10.16 +/- 5.84 vs 4.47 +/- 2.50 ng/mL, P < 0.0001, 139.36 +/- 77.43 vs 61.37 +/- 41.55 ng/mL per mg/kg/day, P < 0.0001). The percentage of patients achieving the optimal trough level on days 2-5 was significantly higher in the Non-Exp group than in the Exp group (40.0% vs 4.3%, P = 0.01). This trend was also observed on days 7-10. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with achievement of the optimal trough level were food non-intake and Non-Exp of CYP3A5. The remission rate was significantly higher in the Non-Exp group than in the Exp group (47.6% vs 16.7%, P = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms affected the pharmacokinetics of Tac, so that the short-term clinical remission rate was different between Exp and Non-Exp of CYP3A5.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of vitamin D (VD) concentrations and VD supplementation on health related quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. METHODS: A cohort of 220 IBD patients including 141 Crohn's disease (CD) and 79 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients was followed-up at a tertiary IBD center. A subgroup of the cohort (n = 26) took VD supplements for > 3 mo. Health related quality of life was assessed using the short IBD questionnaire (sIBDQ). VD serum concentration and sIBDQ score were assessed between August and October 2012 (summer/autumn period) and between February and April 2013 (winter/spring period). The mean VD serum concentration and its correlation with disease activity of CD were determined for each season separately. In a subgroup of patients, the effects of VD supplementation on winter VD serum concentration, change in VD serum concentration from summer to winter, and winter sIBDQ score were analyzed. RESULTS: During the summer/autumn and the winter/spring period, 28% and 42% of IBD patients were VD-deficient (< 20 ng/mL), respectively. In the winter/spring period, there was a significant correlation between sIBDQ score and VD serum concentration in UC patients (r = 0.35, P = 0.02), with a trend towards significance in CD patients (r = 0.17, P = 0.06). In the winter/spring period, VD-insufficient patients (< 30 ng/mL) had a significantly lower mean sIBDQ score than VD-sufficient patients; this was true of both UC (48.3 +/- 2.3 vs 56.7 +/- 3.4, P = 0.04) and CD (55.7 +/- 1.25 vs 60.8 +/- 2.14, P = 0.04) patients. In all analyzed scenarios (UC/CD, the summer/autumn period and the winter/spring period), health related quality of life was the highest in patients with VD serum concentrations of 50-59 ng/mL. Supplementation with a median of 800 IU/d VD day did not influence VD serum concentration or the sIBDQ score. CONCLUSION: VD serum concentration correlated with health related quality of life in UC and CD patients during the winter/spring period.},

   abstract = {Patients have strong beliefs about the role of diet in the cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and in exacerbating or alleviating ongoing symptoms from IBD. The rapid increase in the incidence and prevalence of IBD in recent decades strongly suggests an environmental trigger for IBD, one of which may be dietary patterns. There are several pathways where diet may influence intestinal inflammation, such as direct dietary antigens, altering the gut microbiome, and affecting gastrointestinal permeability. However, data that altering diet can change the natural history of IBD are scarce, and evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD are lacking. Patients, therefore, seek nonmedical resources for dietary guidance, such as patient support groups and unverified sources on the Internet. The aim of this review is to identify patient-targeted dietary recommendations for IBD and to critically appraise the nutritional value of these recommendations. We review patient-targeted dietary information for IBD from structured Internet searches and popular defined diets. Patient-targeted dietary recommendations focus on food restrictions and are highly conflicting. High-quality dietary intervention studies are needed to facilitate creation of evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD.},

In the present study, we investigated the distribution of exogenous pigment throughout the gastrointestinal tract of children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the correlation between their age and the presence and amount of pigment in Peyer patches, and its relation to pediatric IBD. METHODS: Biopsies (upper and lower gastrointestinal tract) from children suspected of having IBD who underwent endoscopy, were reassessed by a blinded, expert pathologist. The amount of pigment in biopsies was scored using a semiquantitative scale (range 0 to +++). RESULTS: A total of 151 children were included: 62 with Crohn disease (CD), 26 with ulcerative colitis, and 63 with non-IBD. In 63 children (42%), deposits of black pigment were found only in biopsies from the terminal ileum, located in Peyer patches. A significant correlation was found between increasing age and the amount of pigment (P = 0.004). Pigment deposits were found significantly less in the patients with CD compared with those in patients with ulcerative colitis and those with non-IBD (26% vs 62% and 49%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for the hypothesis that the amount of pigment, only present in Peyer patches in the terminal ileum, becomes denser with increasing age. Absence of pigment in Peyer patches in a higher number of patients with CD suggests that microparticles may have become involved in the inflammatory process, possibly because of disrupted autophagy.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the diet of pouch patients compared to healthy controls, and to correlate pouch patients' diet with disease behavior. METHODS: Pouch patients were recruited and prospectively followed-up at the Comprehensive Pouch Clinic at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. Pouch behavior was determined based on clinical, endoscopic and histological criteria. Healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers were selected from the "MABAT" Israeli Nutrition and Public Health Governmental Study and served as the control group. All the participants completed a 106-item food frequency questionnaire categorized into food groups and nutritional values based on those used in the United States Department of Agriculture food pyramid and the Israeli food pyramid. Data on Dietary behavior, food avoidance, the use of nutritional supplements, physical activity, smoking habits, and body-mass index (BMI) were also obtained. Pouch patients who had familial adenomatous polyposis (n = 3), irritable pouch syndrome (n = 4), or patients whose pouch surgery took place less than one year previously (n = 5) were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: The pouch patients (n = 80) consumed significantly more from the bakery products food group (1.2 +/- 1.4 servings/d vs 0.6 +/- 1.1 servings/d, P < 0.05) and as twice as many servings from the oils and fats (4.8 +/- 3.4 servings/d vs 2.4 +/- 2 servings/d, P < 0.05), and the nuts and seeds food group (0.3 +/- 0.6 servings/d vs 0.1 +/- 0.4 servings/d, P < 0.05) compared to the controls (n = 80). The pouch patients consumed significantly more total fat (97.6 +/- 40.5 g/d vs 84.4 +/- 39 g/d, P < 0.05) and fat components [monounsaturated fatty acids (38.4 +/- 16.4 g/d vs 30 +/- 14 g/d, P < 0.001), and saturated fatty acids (30 +/- 15.5 g/d vs 28 +/- 14.1 g/d, P < 0.00)] than the controls. In contrast, the pouch patients consumed significantly fewer carbohydrates (305.5 +/- 141.4 g/d vs 369 +/- 215.2 g/d, P = 0.03), sugars (124 +/- 76.2 g/d vs 157.5 +/- 90.4 g/d, P = 0.01), theobromine (77.8 +/- 100 mg/d vs 236.6 +/- 244.5 mg/d, P < 0.00), retinol (474.4 +/- 337.1 mug/d vs 832.4 +/- 609.6 mug/d, P < 0.001) and dietary fibers (26.2 +/- 15.4 g/d vs 30.7 +/- 14 g/d, P = 0.05) than the controls. Comparisons of the food consumption of the patients without (n = 23) and with pouchitis (n = 45) showed that the former consumed twice as many fruit servings as the latter (3.6 +/- 4.1 servings/d vs 1.8 +/- 1.7 servings/d, respectively, P < 0.05). In addition, the pouchitis patients consumed significantly fewer liposoluble antioxidants, such as cryptoxanthin (399 +/- 485 mug/d vs 890.1 +/- 1296.8 mug/d, P < 0.05) and lycopene (6533.1 +/- 6065.7 mug/d vs 10725.7 +/- 10065.9 mug/d, P < 0.05), and less vitamin A (893.3 +/- 516 mug/d vs 1237.5 +/- 728 mug/d, P < 0.05) and vitamin C (153.3 +/- 130 mg/d vs 285.3 +/- 326.3 mg/d, P < 0.05) than the patients without pouchitis. The mean BMI of the pouchitis patients was significantly lower than the BMI of the patients with a normal pouch: 22.6 +/- 3.2 vs 27 +/- 4.9 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Decreased consumption of antioxidants by patients with pouchitis may expose them to the effects of inflammatory and oxidative stress and contribute to the development of pouchitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) self-management fits well within a social-cognitive framework. At the heart of social-cognitive theory is self-efficacy, a set of beliefs about one's ability to perform certain tasks. Self-efficacy is a strong predictor of health outcomes in chronic diseases and could serve as an intermediary outcome measure of self-management for pediatric IBD. The aim of this preliminary study was to develop items for the design of a self-efficacy scale specifically for adolescents and young adults with IBD. METHODS: Survey development is an iterative process. As defined by the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines for developing a patient-reported outcome measurement, the first step of this process is to obtain patient input. Using qualitative research methods, adolescents and young adults were recruited from an outpatient pediatric gastroenterology clinic to participate in a semistructured interview. Transcriptions of the recorded interviews were reviewed for themes related to self-efficacy around disease management. A consensus panel of gastroenterologists and health psychologists reviewed the initially constructed items. Those specific items were then reviewed and adjusted by a panel of participants for content and understandability using cognitive interview methods. The resulting 13-item scale is presented here. RESULTS: Nineteen patients and 5 parents participated in the study. The study sample was 42% girls, 79% whites, 74% had Crohn disease, and 79% had not required surgery. Median age was 15 years (range 10-22 years). Theme analysis and expert review yielded 13 items across 4 theoretical domains: managing medical care, managing daily life with IBD, managing emotions, and managing the future with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: A 13-item disease-specific scale has been developed based on patient input to assess self-efficacy around self-management in adolescents with IBD. Efforts to validate this newly designed scale are presently under way.},

   abstract = {Conventional medical therapies for ulcerative colitis (UC) are still limited due to the adverse side effects like dose-dependent diarrhoea and insufficient potency to keep in remission for long-term periods. So, new alternatives that provide more effective and safe therapies for ulcerative colitis are constantly being sought. In the present study, probiotic LaBb Dahi was selected for investigation of its therapeutic effect on DSS-induced colitis model in mice. LaBb Dahi was prepared by co-culturing Dahi culture of Lactococci along with selected strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus LaVK2 and Bifidobacterium bifidum BbVK3 in buffalo milk. Four groups of mice (12 each) were fed for 17 d with buffalo milk (normal control), buffalo milk plus DSS (Colitis control), Dahi plus DSS, and LaBb Dahi plus DSS, respectively, with basal diet. The disease activity scores, weight loss, organ weight, colon length, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and beta-glucoronidase activity was assessed, and the histopathological picture of the colon of mice was studied. All colitis control mice evidenced significant increase in MPO, beta-glucoronidase activity and showed high disease activity scores along with histological damage to colonic tissue. Feeding with LaBb Dahi offered significant reduction in MPO activity, beta-glucoronidase activity and improved disease activity scores. We found significant decline in length of colon, organ weight and body weight in colitis induced controls which were improved significantly by feeding LaBb Dahi. The present study suggests that LaBb Dahi can be used as a potential nutraceutical intervention to combat UC related changes and may offer effective adjunctive treatment for management of UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To identify environmental risk factors for developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children <15 years of age. METHODS: IBD patients and randomly selected healthy controls from a well defined geographical area in Denmark were prospectively recruited in the period 1.1.2007-31.12.2009. Data regarding socioeconomic status, area of residence, living conditions, infections and diet were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 118 IBD patients (59 Crohn's disease (CD), 56 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 IBD unclassified (IBDU)) and 477 healthy controls filled out the questionnaire. The response rates were 91% in patients and 45% in controls, respectively. Several risk factors for IBD were identified: IBD in first degree relatives (IBD: OR (odds ratio): 6.1 (95%CI: 2.5-15.0), CD (OR: 6.8 (2.3-20.2)) and UC (OR: 6.1 (2.3-16.0))); bedroom sharing (IBD: OR: 2.1 (1.0-4.3), CD (OR: 3.6 (1.3-9.4))); high sugar intake (IBD: OR: 2.5 (1.0-6.2), CD (OR: 2.9 (1.0-8.5))); prior admission to a hospital for gastrointestinal infections (IBD: 7.7 (3.1-19.1), CD (7.9 (2.5-24.9)) and UC (7.4 (2.5-21.6))); stressful events (IBD: 1.7 (1.0-2.9)). Protective factors were daily vs. less than daily vegetable consumption (CD: 0.3 (0.1-1.0), UC (0.3 (0.1-0.8))) and whole meal bread consumption (IBD: OR: 0.5 (0.3-0.9), CD (0.4 (0.2-0.9))). An increased risk of diagnosis of CD compared to UC was shown for patients living in more urban areas (OR: 1.3 (1.1-1.6)). CONCLUSION: We identified several risk and protective factors for developing IBD. Studies on the influence of environmental factors are important in our understanding of aetiology and phenotypes of paediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Colonic fermentation in patients with UC in remission was compared with that in matched healthy subjects on habitual diets and when dietary fibre was increased. DESIGN: Fibre intake, faecal output of fibre (measured as non-starch polysaccharide (NSP)), starch, microbiota and fermentation products, and whole gut transit time (WGTT) were assessed in association with habitual diet and when dietary intake of wheat bran (WB)-associated fibre and high amylose-associated resistant starch (RS) was increased in an 8-week, randomised, single-blind, cross-over study. RESULTS: Despite a tendency to lower habitual fibre intake in UC patients, faecal NSP and starch concentrations were threefold higher than in controls, whereas concentrations of phenols and short-chain fatty acids, pH and WGTT were similar. Increasing RS/WB intake was well tolerated. In controls (n=10), it more than doubled faecal NSP and starch excretion (p=0.002 for both), had no effect on NSP usage and reduced WGTT (p=0.024). In UC patients (n=19), high intake of RS/WB tended to normalise gut transit, but did not increase the proportion of NSP fermented. Increasing intake of RS/WB had little effect on faecal fermentation patterns or the structure of the microbiota. However, faeces from the UC cohort had lower proportions of Akkermansia muciniphila and increased diversity within Clostridium cluster XIVa compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Gut fermentation of NSP and starch is diminished in patients with UC. This cannot be explained by abnormal gut transit and was not corrected by increasing RS/WB intake, and may be due to abnormal functioning of the gut microbiota.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a 25 kDa glycoprotein present in the bodily fluids and tissues. It is secreted by neutrophils, epithelial cells, hepatocytes and adipocytes, and its expression is highly increased in response to cellular stress. The role of NGAL in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in children has thus far not been studied. METHODS: The following groups of children were included: (i) inflammatory bowel disease group, n = 36, aged from 1 to 18 years with Crohn's disease (n = 19) and ulcerative colitis (n = 17); (ii) control group, n = 126; and (iii) disease control group, n = 27, without inflammatory bowel disease, with a food and/or inhalant allergy. RESULTS: Healthy children aged from 1 to 8 years exhibited lower NGAL level than those of 9 to 18 years old (39.0; 18.1-83.7 ng/mL vs 57.6; 28.7-107 ng/mL, P = 0.001). In the younger, but not in the older children, the serum NGAL level correlated with their age, r = 0.334, P = 0.001. In children with inflammatory bowel disease, serum NGAL level was higher (108; 37.3-245 ng/mL) than in healthy (42.0; 18.1-107 ng/mL) and allergic, noninflammatory bowel disease children (49.3; 19.3-107 ng/mL), P = 0.001. Serum NGAL levels in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis children did not correlate with age, gender, disease activity, and indices of the inflammation. CONCLUSION: Serum NAGL levels are highly elevated in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in children compared to the healthy control group. Systematic studies are needed to explain the role of this protein in the inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested to be associated with high risk of Crohn's disease (CD). In France, where food fortification is limited, the major source of vitamin D is through sun exposure. The aim of this work was to analyze the relationship between residential sun exposure and the risk of incident CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The E3N cohort consists of women living in France, aged 40 to 65 years and free of major diseases at inclusion in 1990. Among the 91,870 women included in the study, we identified 123 incident cases (45 CD, 71 UC, and 7 indeterminate colitis). To assess residential sun exposure, we used a database containing mean daily ultraviolet radiation (UVR) dose for each French county. The relationship between residential sun exposure and risk of incident inflammatory bowel diseases was explored using Cox models. RESULTS: Higher levels of residential sun exposure were associated with a significant decreased risk of CD (hazard ratio [HR] for the third versus the first tertile of UVR dose, 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23-1.01; P for trend = 0.04), but not of UC (HR, 1.21; CI, 0.61-2.11). In women with available data on dietary vitamin D intake, we observed a lower risk of CD with higher residential UVR (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.80; P for trend = 0.01). Dietary vitamin D intake was neither associated with the risk of CD (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.14-1.24; P for trend = 0.14) nor UC (HR, 1.61; CI, 0.61-4.23). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective cohort of women, high residential sunlight exposure was associated with decreased incidence of CD, but not UC.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic recurrent disease characterized by acute inflammation of the colonic mucosa. In Japan, a dietary supplementation product enriched with glutamine, dietary fiber, and oligosaccharide (GFO) is widely applied for enteral nutrition support. These three components have been suggested to improve intestinal health. In this study, we investigated whether GFO has suppressive effects on mucosal damage in ulcerative colitis in an experimental mouse model. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice received 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water for 5 d to induce colitis. Then, they were given 0.25 mL of GFO or a 20% glucose solution twice daily for 10 d. Another set of mice receiving unaltered drinking water was used as the normal control group. RESULTS: The body weight loss and disease activity index were significantly lower in the GFO-treated mice compared with the glucose-treated mice (P < 0.05). The decrease in colon length induced by dextran sulfate sodium was significantly alleviated in GFO-treated mice compared with glucose-treated mice (P < 0.01). In addition, the histologic findings showed that intestinal inflammation was significantly attenuated in mice treated with GFO. Furthermore, treatment with GFO significantly inhibited the dextran sulfate sodium-induced increase in the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that GFO has potential therapeutic value as an adjunct therapy for ulcerative colitis.},

The present study aimed to investigate the nutritional status of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients in Isfahan, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this descriptive analytical cross-sectional study, between Dec 2011 and Jun 2012, 99 patients with UC were randomly selected and evaluated. Age, sex, duration of disease, body mass index (BMI) and laboratory parameters recorded for all patients. Nutritional risk index (NRI) was calculated and its association with patients' variables was assessed with regard to UC disease severity. RESULTS: Twelve patients out of 99 patients had mild UC and 87 patients had moderate to severe UC. Based on the NRI, 90.9% were not malnourished and 9.1% were at moderate to severe risk for malnutrition. Among laboratory parameters only, serum potassium level in patients with moderate to severe UC was significantly higher than those with mild UC (P = 0.017). Other laboratory parameters were similar between patients stratified by US status. Patients age s significantly correlate with serum vitamin D, immunoglobulin a (IgA) and potassium level (P > 0.05), also duration of disease was significantly correlate with Phosphorus (P = 0.024) among laboratory parameters. CONCLUSION: In studied UC patients, malnutrition risk was based on degree of disease severity. Patients with moderate to severe UC were more at risk for malnutrition compared to the patients with mild UC. Furthermore, among laboratory parameters only serum potassium level was higher among patients with moderate to severe UC compared to others.},

It has also been shown to have a pivotal role in the development of experimental colitis in mice. The increased expression of CXCL16 has been demonstrated in inflamed lesions of patients with Crohn disease. Our aim was to study the expression of CXCL16 in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Relative quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was applied to explore the gene expressions of CXCL16, its receptor CXCR6, and interleukin 8, an inflammatory marker, in the colonic biopsies of children with active ulcerative colitis (n=19), children with ulcerative colitis in remission (n=9) and children with no inflammatory condition in colon (n=14). RESULTS: An increased expression of CXCL16 in the colonic biopsies of children with ulcerative colitis was found both in active disease (p=0.006) and in remission (p=0.033), when compared to children without inflammatory condition. The gene expressions of interleukin 8 and CXCL16 correlated with each other (rs=0.67, p=0.01). The expression of CXCR6 mRNA was comparable between the study groups (p=0.50). CONCLUSIONS: The gene expression of CXCL16 was increased in patients with ulcerative colitis both in active disease and in remission suggesting an important role of the molecule in the pathogenesis of the condition.},

   abstract = {The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease are rapidly increasing in Western countries and in developed Asian countries. Although biologic agents targeting the immune system have been effective in patients with IBD, cessation of treatment leads to relapse in the majority of patients, suggesting that intrinsic immune dysregulation is an effect, not a cause, of IBD. Dramatic changes in the environment, resulting in the dysregulated composition of intestinal microbiota or dysbiosis, may be associated with the fundamental causes of IBD. Japan now has upgraded water supply and sewerage systems, as well as dietary habits and antibiotic overuse that are similar to such features found in developed Western countries. The purpose of this review article was to describe the association of diet, particularly Japanese food and microbiota, with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Crohn's disease (CD), the involvement of food antigens in immune responses remains unclear. The objective of this study was to detect immune responses against food antigens in CD patients and examine the mechanism in a mouse model of colitis. METHODS: We enrolled 98 CD patients, 50 ulcerative colitis patients, and 52 healthy controls (HCs) to compare the levels of serum immunoglobulin (Ig)Gs against 88 foods. The presence of serum IgGs against foods was also examined in interleukin (IL)-10 knockout (KO) mice in which CD4(+) T cell activation by antigenic food protein was assessed. Mice transferred with IL-10 KO cells received diets with or without food antigens, and the development of colitis was evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of IgGs against various foods, especially vegetables, grains, and nuts, was significantly higher in CD patients than in HCs. Similarly, the prevalence of IgGs against food proteins was higher in IL-10 KO mice than in BALB/c mice. Beta-conglycinin, identified as an antigenic food proteins in IL-10 KO mice, induced CD4(+) T cell production of interferon-gamma and IL-17 through dendritic cell antigen presentation. Elimination of the food antigens ameliorated the development of colitis in mice without altering the composition of their intestinal microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: In CD colitis mice, intestinal inflammation via CD4(+) T cell hyperactivation was induced by food antigens associated with high serum IgG levels and was ameliorated by the elimination of food antigens. This disrupted immunological tolerance to food antigen, which might act as an exacerbating factor, remains to be elucidated in CD patients.},

This narrative review summarizes the findings of relevant publications identified using the PubMed database. Although antibiotics have been associated with an increased risk of IBD development and flares, several meta-analyses demonstrate that antibiotics are efficacious for the induction of remission and treatment of flares in patients with IBD. Data supporting their use include a large number of antibiotic studies in Crohn's disease and evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, although there are fewer studies of the latter. For Crohn's disease, antibiotics have been shown to be useful for the induction of remission and in the postoperative management of patients undergoing surgery. Additionally, patients with fistulizing disease, particularly perianal, can benefit from antibiotics administered short term. Both antimicrobials and probiotics have been shown to be useful for the treatment of pouchitis. Additional randomized controlled trials are needed to further elucidate the role of bacteria in IBD and to better inform clinicians about appropriate antibiotic therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain. The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel, which is involved in visceral pain signalling, has been shown to be up-regulated in IBS. Activation of TRPV1 leads to the release of neuropeptides, such as somatostatin and substance P (SP). We hypothesized that increased pain perception in IBS could be explained by increased transcription in TRPV1 and/or altered levels of neuropeptides. We therefore assessed the transcription of TRPV1 and the mucosal concentration of somatostatin and SP in IBS in comparison to healthy volunteers and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission as disease controls, and to ascertain their relationship to pain symptoms. METHOD: Sigmoid colonic mucosal samples were collected from 12 patients with IBS, 34 patients with UC in remission and 9 healthy volunteers, in which groups TRPV1 mRNA levels were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and neuropeptide concentrations by radioimmunoassay. Pain symptom intensity was determined by questionnaires. RESULTS: Transcription of TRPV1 as well as the concentration of neuropeptides were significantly higher in IBS, but only the former correlated with pain symptom severity. CONCLUSION: Increased transcription of TRPV1 may provide a possible explanation for pain generation in IBS. While the neuropeptides SP and somatostatin were both found to be increased in IBS, these changes are not sufficient to explain pain generation. Pain generation in IBS is probably explained by a complex redundancy in the regulation of local nociceptive mechanisms, which remains a subject of intensive investigation.},

Such effects were investigated using in vitro batch cultures (with/without mucin, peptone or starch) inoculated with faecal slurries from healthy or UC patients; the growth of five bacterial groups was monitored along with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. Healthy cultures gave two-fold higher growth and SCFA levels with up to ten-fold higher butyrate production. Starch gave the highest growth and SCFA production (particularly butyrate), indicating starch-enhanced saccharolytic activity. Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were the predominant bacterial group (of five examined) for UC inocula whereas they were the minority group for the healthy inocula. Furthermore, SRB growth was stimulated by peptone presumably due to the presence of sulphur-rich amino acids. The results suggest raised SRB levels in UC, which could contribute to the condition through release of toxic sulphide.},

   abstract = {The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rapidly increasing in developing countries, especially among populations that are adopting Western-style diets. Several, but not all, epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that a high intake of meat, especially red and processed meat, is associated with increased CRC risk. Potential reasons for the association between high red and processed meat intake and CRC risk include the content of the meat (e.g. protein, heme) and compounds generated by the cooking process (e.g. N-nitroso compounds, heterocyclic amines). These factors can affect the large intestine mucosa with genotoxicity and metabolic disturbances. Increased bacterial fermentation (putrefaction) of undigested protein and production of bacterial metabolites derived from amino acids may affect colon epithelial homeostasis and renewal. This correlates with the fact that most colonic cancers are detected in the distal colon and rectum where protein fermentation actively occurs. However, there are still large controversies on the relationship between red meat consumption and CRC risk. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to enhance the current understanding on the association between high red and processed meat intakes with CRC risk. A principal focus of this review will be to discuss the meat-related components, such as proteins in the meat, heme, N-nitroso compounds, and heterocyclic amines, and the effects they have upon the large intestine mucosa and the intestinal gut microbiota.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, involves chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Previously, Sasa quelpaertensis leaves have been shown to mediate anti-inflammation and anti-cancer effects, although it remains unclear whether Sasa leaves are able to attenuate inflammation-related intestinal diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of Sasa quelpaertensis leaf extract (SQE) using an in vitro co-culture model of the intestinal epithelial environment. MATERIALS/METHODS: An in vitro co-culture system was established that consisted of intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce inflammation. RESULTS: Treatment with SQE significantly suppressed the secretion of LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-6, and IL-1beta in co-cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages. In addition, expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were down-regulated in response to inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation by SQE. Compared with two bioactive compounds that have previously been identified in SQE, tricin and P-coumaric acid, SQE exhibited the most effective anti-inflammatory properties. CONCLUSIONS: SQE exhibited intestinal anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting various inflammatory mediators mediated through nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-kB) activation. Thus, SQE has the potential to ameliorate inflammation-related diseases, including IBD, by limiting excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {Sasa quelpaertensis leaves exert anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic effects, although it remains unclear whether these leaves can suppress inflammation-related intestinal diseases. This study hypothesized that Sasa quelpaertensis leaf extract (SQE) exerts a protective effect against inflammation in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. Therefore, colon tissues of DSS-induced colitis mice that were treated with SQE were assayed for levels of proinflammatory markers, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, and activation of nuclear factor kappaB. For this purpose, mice were pretreated with SQE (100 mg/kg or 300 mg/kg body weight) by gavage for a 2-week period. Mice then received either SQE or sulfasalazine (100 mg/kg body weight) with 2.5% DSS in drinking water for 7 days twice daily and 7 days of tap water ad libitum between DSS treatment. Treatment with SQE was found to attenuate the severity of DSS-induced colitis, as assessed by disease activity index scores, shrinkage of colon length, and histopathologic changes. SQE reduced DSS-induced proliferation in distal colon tissues. It also significantly suppressed levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in serum and colon tissues, nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase, and levels of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinases, p38, extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2, and IkappaBalpha in colon tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that SQE supplementation can exert an anti-inflammatory effect on experimental chronic colitis.},

The objective of this study was to investigate whether inclusion of this bacterial meal in the diet could abrogate disease development in a murine model of epithelial injury and colitis and thus possibly have therapeutic potential in human inflammatory bowel disease. C57BL/6N mice were fed ad libitum a control diet or an experimental diet containing 254 g/kg of body weight BioProtein, a bacterial meal consisting of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), together with the heterogenic bacteria Ralstonia sp., Brevibacillus agri, and Aneurinibacillus sp. At day 8, colitis was induced by 3.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) ad libitum in the drinking water for 6 days. Symptoms of DSS treatment were less profound after prophylactic treatment with the diet containing the BioProtein. Colitis-associated parameters such as reduced body weight, colon shortening, and epithelial damage also showed significant improvement. Levels of acute-phase reactants, proteins whose plasma concentrations increase in response to inflammation, and neutrophil infiltration were reduced. On the other, increased epithelial cell proliferation and enhanced mucin 2 (Muc2) transcription indicated improved integrity of the colonic epithelial layer. BioProtein mainly consists of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) (88%). The results that we obtained when using a bacterial meal consisting of M. capsulatus (Bath) were similar to those obtained when using BioProtein in the DSS model. Our results show that a bacterial meal of the noncommensal bacterium M. capsulatus (Bath) has the potential to attenuate DSS-induced colitis in mice by enhancing colonic barrier function, as judged by increased epithelial proliferation and increased Muc2 transcription.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) constitute the two major groups of idiopathic disorders in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Environmental factors, genetic factors and immune responses have been considered as the major etiology of IBD. Despite the diversified pathogenesis of the disease, no guaranteed curative therapeutic regimen has been developed so far. This review summarizes the knowledge on the pathophysiology and current treatment approaches of IBD. Since IBD is caused by excessive and tissue- disruptive inflammatory reactions of the gut wall, down-regulation of the immune responses may allow the damaged mucosa to heal and reset the physiological functions of the gut back to normal. Current pharmacotherapy through modulation of neutrophil-derived factors, cytokines, adhesion molecules and reactive oxygen/nitrogen metabolites has been utterly described. Categories of treatment modalities include corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, antibiotics, probiotics, and a series of unique novel agents. The use of anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody (Infliximab), recombinant anti-inflammatory cytokines and related gene therapy has been covered. In addition, discussions on dietary supplementation and heparin treatment are also included. The anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory potential of investigational agents such as nicotine and the filtered protective compounds from tobacco smoke, as well as active herbal medicinal compounds were tested in our previous experimental works, whereas promising findings have been presented here. With the discovery of novel target-oriented agents, more effective and relatively harmless approaches of IBD therapy could be established to achieve a curative outcome. Indeed, more experimental and clinical studies are needed to confirm the relevance of these therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the general population and in patients with chronic diseases has increased markedly in recent decades. We aimed to determine the prevalence, type, and predictors of oral CAM use among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with the general population in a large, population-based, case-control study. METHODS: Overall, 1370 patients with IBD and 598 control subjects in Canterbury, New Zealand, were recruited. Environmental and phenotypic data were obtained through a questionnaire and case note review. Predictors of oral CAM use were identified using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: In the previous year, 44.1% of patients with IBD and 42.3% of control subjects used oral CAM (odds ratio [OR], 1.078; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.885-1.312). The types of oral CAM used most frequently were vitamins (Crohn's disease [CD], 25.2%; ulcerative colitis, 23.7%; control subjects, 24.9%), followed by herbs (CD 15.1%, ulcerative colitis 15.2%, control subjects 12.8%), and dietary supplements (CD, 8.5%; ulcerative colitis 12.6%, control subjects 12.1%). Female gender (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.25-2.08), younger age (P = 0.005), higher education (P = 0.002), higher income (P = 0.04), being a vegetarian (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.97-6.48) and a middle social class at birth (P = 0.024) were independent predictors of oral CAM use in patients with IBD. Disease phenotype was not associated with oral CAM use. In control subjects, female gender (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.85-3.86), higher education (P = 0.003) and a diagnosis of asthma (P = 0.017) predicted oral CAM use. CONCLUSIONS: Oral CAM use is common in, and does not differ between, patients with IBD and the general population in Canterbury, New Zealand. Socio-demographic factors, and not disease phenotype, predict oral CAM use in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {Studies of the roles of microbial communities in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have reached an important milestone. A decade of genome-wide association studies and other genetic analyses have linked IBD with loci that implicate an aberrant immune response to the intestinal microbiota. More recently, profiling studies of the intestinal microbiome have associated the pathogenesis of IBD with characteristic shifts in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, reinforcing the view that IBD results from altered interactions between intestinal microbes and the mucosal immune system. Enhanced technologies can increase our understanding of the interactions between the host and its resident microbiota and their respective roles in IBD from both a large-scale pathway view and at the metabolic level. We review important microbiome studies of patients with IBD and describe what we have learned about the mechanisms of intestinal microbiota dysfunction. We describe the recent progress in microbiome research from exploratory 16S-based studies, reporting associations of specific organisms with a disease, to more recent studies that have taken a more nuanced view, addressing the function of the microbiota by metagenomic and metabolomic methods. Finally, we propose study designs and methodologies for future investigations of the microbiome in patients with inflammatory gut and autoimmune diseases in general.},

   abstract = {While the etiological underpinnings of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are highly complex, it has been noted that both clinical and pathophysiological similarities exist between IBD and both asthma and non-pulmonary allergic phenomena. In this review, several key points on common biomarkers, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and nutritional and probiotic interventions for both IBD and non-pulmonary allergic diseases are discussed. Histamine and mast cell activity show common behaviors in both IBD and in certain allergic disorders. IgE also represents a key immunoglobulin involved in both IBD and in certain allergic pathologies, though these links require further study. Probiotics remain a critically important intervention for both IBD subtypes as well as multiple allergic phenomena. Linked clinical phenomena, especially sinonasal disease and IBD, are discussed. In addition, nutritional interventions remain an underutilized and promising therapy for modification of both allergic disorders and IBD. Recommending new mothers breastfeed their infants, and increasing the duration of breastfeeding may also help prevent both IBD and allergic diseases, but requires more investigation. While much remains to be discovered, it is clear that non-pulmonary allergic phenomena are connected to IBD in a myriad number of ways and that the discovery of common immunological pathways may usher in an era of vastly improved treatments for patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Profermin is developed for the dietary management of ulcerative colitis (UC). It consists of water, fermented oats, barley malt, lecithin, and Lactobacillus plantarum 299v. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy of Profermin. METHODS: Seventy-four patients with a mild-to-moderate flare-up of UC (defined as Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index [SCCAI] score >/=5 and </=11) were randomly assigned to Profermin (n = 32) or Fresubin (n = 41). The primary endpoint was to assess whether addition of Profermin in UC could significantly reduce SCCAI in comparison with Fresubin. RESULTS: In the run-in period, the mean SCCAI was 7.2 +/- 1.50 in the Profermin group and 7.6 +/- 1.47 in the Fresubin group (not significant). After 8 weeks of treatment, the mean reduction of SCCAI score was higher in the Profermin group (mean difference: -1.77 SCCAI, 95% confidence interval -2.97 to -0.55; P < 0.005), in intention-to-treat analyses. Remission defined as SCCAI </=2.5 was achieved in 10 of 32 (31%) in the Profermin group and in 6 of 41 (15%) in the Fresubin group (P = 0.048). The decrease in SCCAI scores of >/=50% was higher in the Profermin group 17 of 32 (53%) versus 11 of 41 (27%) (P = 0.04). The risk of dropping out due to treatment failure/lack of effect was higher in the Fresubin group (42% versus 13%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with Profermin is safe, well tolerated, palatable, and able to reduce SCCAI scores at a statistically and clinically significant level in patients with mild-to-moderate UC with a flare-up.},

Probiotics interfere with local and systemic immune reactions and thus exert an influence on the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa. Therefore, attempting inflammatory bowel disease treatment with probiotics seems reasonable. In fact, a growing number of trials have studied the therapeutic effects in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Promising results have been found and in some, indications such as maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis and pouchitis guidelines recommend therapy with probiotics already today. However, many open questions still remain and the urgent need for high-quality trials requires much more research in the future.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The impact of food on relapse in ulcerative colitis has not been clearly defined. The aim of this prospective, randomized-controlled study was to evaluate the impact of comprehensive dietary guidelines on the clinical course of the disease and quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were allocated randomly to an intervention or a control group. Participants in the intervention group were provided dietary guidelines in the form of an educational booklet that was recommended for use for 4-6 weeks during disease flare, that patients eat little and often (four to six times a day), drink adequate fluids, decrease excess intake of fat, decrease simple carbohydrates and decrease high-fibre foods during flare.Validated and study-designed questionnaires were used to compare patients' perceived quality of life, colitis activity scores and eating habits before and following the dietary advice provided. RESULTS: Overall, 112 patients completed the study. Study participants were asked to complete the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index together with the Food Frequency Questionnaire at 0, 6 and 24 weeks. At 24 weeks, there was a mean reduction in the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index score in the intervention group compared with an increase in the score in the control group [-1.304 (P=0.0108) vs. 0.875 (P=0.0249)]. There was a mean increase in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire score in the intervention group compared with a reduction in the score in the control group [7.17 (P=0.126) vs. -3.44 (P=0.205)]. A total of 69% of patients in the intervention group found the dietary advice significantly or moderately helpful. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that there is likely to be a link between the dietary advice provided and symptomatic improvement. The effect of diet may not occur through the addition or the elimination of single nutrients; rather, each food consumed combines many nutrients that allow for a synergistic or an antagonistic action when present in a certain composition.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review for Complementary and Alternative Medicine [CAM] as defined by the National Institute of Health in Inflammatory Bowel Disease [IBD], ie Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC], with the exception of dietary and nutritional supplements, and manipulative therapies. METHODS: A computerized search of databases [Cochrane Library, Pubmed/Medline, PsychINFO, and Scopus] through March 2014 was performed. We screened the reference sections of original studies and systematic reviews in English language for CAM in IBD, CD and UC. Randomized controlled trials [RCT] and controlled trials [CT] were referred and assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: A total of: 26 RCT and 3 CT for herbal medicine, eg aloe-vera gel, andrographis paniculata, artemisia absinthium, barley foodstuff, boswellia serrata, cannabis, curcumin, evening primrose oil, Myrrhinil intest(R), plantago ovata, silymarin, sophora, tormentil, wheatgrass-juice and wormwood; 1 RCT for trichuris suis ovata; 7 RCT for mind/body interventions such as lifestyle modification, hypnotherapy, relaxation training and mindfulness; and 2 RCT in acupuncture; were found. Risk of bias was quite heterogeneous. Best evidence was found for herbal therapy, ie plantago ovata and curcumin in UC maintenance therapy, wormwood in CD, mind/body therapy and self-intervention in UC, and acupuncture in UC and CD. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary and alternative therapies might be effective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases; however, given the low number of trials and the heterogeneous methodological quality of trials, further in-depth research is necessary.},

They were rare before the 1930's but the incidence has been increasing in both developed and developing countries. We have recently reported that the incidence in Nova Scotia, the area with one of the highest reported burden globally, is decreasing since 1997. We postulate that this decrease may be due to the addition of folate to cereals. This was mandated in 1998 but the process of fortification began in 1997. There is circumstantial evidence from epidemiology studies that a diet deficient in folate may have contributed to the global rise in these diseases. This hypothesis, if proven to be correct, has important implications for the prevention and treatment of these diseases.},

   abstract = {Tributyrin (TBT) is a TAG composed of three butyric acids that has beneficial effects on ulcerative colitis due to its trophic, anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic and anti-carcinogenic properties. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of action of TBT supplementation in the prevention of mucosal damage in experimental colitis. Mice received either a control diet or a TBT-supplemented diet for 15 d. Colitis was induced by dextran sodium sulphate administration during the last 7 d. Mucosal damage and the activation of immune cells and cytokines were determined by histological score, flow cytometry and ELISA. Leucocyte rolling and adhesion were assessed by intravital microscopy. Oxidative stress was determined by monitoring hydroperoxide concentration and evaluating superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities. Intestinal permeability was analysed using diethylenetriaminepentaacetate acid (99mTcDTPA). Compared with the colitis group, the animals in the colitis+TBT group had reduced mucosal damage and neutrophil and eosinophil mucosal infiltration, which were associated with a higher percentage of regulatory T cells (Treg) and higher levels of transforming growth factor beta and IL-10 in the lamina propria. The level of in vivo leucocyte adhesion in the colon microvasculature was reduced after TBT supplementation. A lower level of hydroperoxide and higher levels of SOD and catalase activities were associated with TBT supplementation. TBT-supplemented mice showed reduced intestinal permeability to the levels intermediate between the control and colitis groups. In conclusion, the present results show that TBT has positive effects on colonic restructuring in experimental colitis. Additionally, TBT supplementation changes the immune response by controlling inflammation and regulating the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and Treg.},

   abstract = {It is important to have clear goals for treating inflammatory bowel disease in clinical practice and in research. Conventional end points for trials in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have been based on composite indices, such as the Mayo Clinic Score and the Crohn's Disease Activity Index; these indices incorporate symptoms, signs, and findings from laboratory tests and sometimes endoscopic assessments. Although definitions of clinical response and remission have been based on these indices for regulatory purposes, they are difficult to apply to practice because they are complex and not intuitive to clinicians. This has caused a disconnect between clinical trials and practice. Recently, the use of composite indices in trials has been reevaluated in Food and Drug Administration-sponsored Gastroenterology Regulatory Endpoints and the Advancement of Therapeutics workshops due to concerns about the validity of the indices. Alternative measures of outcome and definitions of response are being developed. Patient-reported outcomes are psychometric instruments created and defined by patients to quantify symptoms. A combination of end points, comprising patient-reported outcomes and objective evaluation of inflammation by endoscopy, offers a clinically meaningful and scientifically valid alternative to existing composite indices. Unlike composite indices, response definitions based on endoscopy and patient-reported outcomes can be readily applied in practice. This convergence of outcome assessment in clinical trials and practice could expedite implementation of "treat-to-target" algorithms, in which therapy is progressively intensified until a specific treatment goal is reached. This approach could improve patient care by reducing rates of disease-related complications, surgery, and hospitalization.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of probiotics on the treatment outcomes of ulcerative colitis, and explore its possible mechanism. METHODS: According to the table of random number, 60 ulcerative colitis patients in our hospital were enrolled prospectively and divided into 3 groups: Golden Bifid group, Changmei group, combination group (Golden+ Changmei). Patients in Golden Bifid group received Golden Bifid 2.0 g, bid, those in Changmei group received Changmei 1.0 g, tid, and those in combination group received the above two drugs for 24 months. The clinical symptom score, colon mucosa inflammation score and endoscopic grade score were calculated and compared. IL-10 in mucosa and serum was determined by immunohistochemistry and double-antibody sandwich ELISA. RESULTS: In combined group after 24 months of treatment, clinical symptom score (12.5+/-2.1 vs. 2.3+/-0.8, P=0.016), endoscopic classification score (3.02+/-0.17 vs. 0.25+/-0.13, P=0.032), inflammatory reaction score (2.63+/-0.19 vs. 0.77+/-0.16, P=0.028) were significantly higher than those before treatment. While the scores differences of before and after treatment in Gold Bifid group and Changmei group were not statistically significant (P>0.05). IL-10 in serum [(17.4+/-2.2) ng/L vs. (12.8+/-2.2) ng/L, P=0.015] and colon mucosa [85% (17/20) vs. 55% (11/20), P=0.026] in combination group were significantly higher than those before treatment. The differences in IL-10 expression level before and after treatment were not statistically significant in the Gold Bifid group and Changmei group (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Golden Bifid combined with Changmei as microbial ecological agents has a positive efficacy on mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, which may be associated with the up-regulation of IL-10 expression.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mesenteric fat plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD), and a higher ratio of visceral fat area (VFA) to subcutaneous fat area (SFA) is related to complicated disease status. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective treatment option for patients with CD, and the aims of this study were to assess the effects of EEN on abdominal fat in patients with CD. METHODS: Patient data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. The SFA and VFA were measured in 38 patients with CD before and after 8-week EEN therapy, and the mesenteric fat index (MFI), defined as the ratio of VFA to SFA, was calculated. The correlations between MFI and CD activity index and C-reactive protein level were also evaluated. RESULTS: The median age of the patients in our study was 29 years, and the median duration of disease was 3.05 years. Both VFA (P = 0.029) and MFI (P = 0.021) were significantly decreased in patients after EEN, but no significant change was observed in SFA (P = 0.335). MFI was significantly correlated with CD activity index (r = 0.523, P = 0.001) and C-reactive protein (r = 0.634, P < 0.0001) in patients with active CD before EEN, although no positive correlations were observed in patients after EEN treatment. CONCLUSIONS: EEN induction therapy was associated with a significant decrease in VFA in patients with CD, and MFI was significantly correlated with CD activity index and C-reactive protein in active CD. Thus, our data reveal additional beneficial therapeutic mechanisms of enteral nutrition treatment in CD.},

IBD has been reported an increased prevalence of low bone mass. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the nutritional status and to investigate the correlation between bone mineral density (BMD) and nutrient factors in patients with IBD. METHODS: A total of 41 subjects were classified into normal group (n=21) and malnourished group (n=20) by the subjective global assessment result. We surveyed the dietary habit, nutrient intake, and BMD. RESULTS: Subjects' average age was 36.7 years old, and included 26 ulcerative colitis and 15 Crohn's disease. The serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher and serum calcium was significantly lower in the malnourished group. Lower bone density subjects were more in the malnourished group but no significant difference. Intake of energy, protein, carbohydrate, fiber, iron, sodium, potassium, zinc, vitamin B6, vitamin C and folate were significantly lower in the malnourished group. The BMD of malnourished group showed correlation with triceps skin fold thickness (TSF), CRP, dietary calcium, phosphorous, iron, animal iron, zinc and vitamin. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that adequate intake of nutrients is important to prevent bone loss and systemic education programs are need for IBD patients.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Vitamin D has an important role in the immune regulation. Vitamin D is essential for innate and adaptive immune systems and it plays a significant role in the formation of immune tolerance, as well. AIM: Vitamin D deficiency has been observed in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases in Western Europe, but there is no data available from Eastern Europe. METHOD: The study included 169 patients with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: The median vitamin D level was 22.7+/-10.6 ng/ml. Only 20% of the patients had adequate vitamin D level (>30 ng/ml), 52% had vitamin D insufficiency (15-30 ng/ml), and 28% of them had severe vitamin D deficiency (<15 ng/ml). Vitamin D concentration failed to correlate with clinical activity indexes (partial Mayo score: r = -0.143; Crohn's disease activity index: r = -0.253) and with inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein: r = 0.008; erythrocyte sedimentation rate: r = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Since vitamin D deficiency can be frequently observed in Hungarian patients with inflammatory bowel disease, its level should be tested in these patients.},

However, knowledge on trace element alteration in patients who had undergone this surgery is limited. This study was conducted to assess trace element alteration in patients with ulcerative colitis before and after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Preoperative (40) and postoperative (35) ulcerative colitis patients were studied. The dietary assessment of trace element intake was undertaken by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Patients' trace element status of zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, calcium, iron, and vitamin D3 was assessed by measuring their blood concentrations. We found that with the similar dietary intake, there was no statistical difference in the concentrations of plasma copper, iron, calcium, and vitamin D3 in the two groups (P > 0.05). Compared with preoperative patients, postoperative patients had higher concentrations of plasma zinc (14.51 +/- 4.75 mumol/l) and manganese (0.21 +/- 0.11 mumol/l) and lower concentrations of plasma selenium (0.86 +/- 0.58 mumol/l). Both preoperative and postoperative mean concentrations of plasma calcium and vitamin D3 were below their reference range, respectively. We conclude that IPAA does not seem to alter patients' abnormal trace elements completely. It is important to monitor and supply some specified trace elements even in postoperative patients.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a risk factor for the development of colon cancer. Environmental factors including diet and the microflora influence disease outcome. Folate and homocysteine have been associated with IBD-mediated colon cancer but their roles remain unclear. We used a model of chemically induced ulcerative colitis (dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)) with or without the colon carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) to determine the impact of dietary folic acid (FA) on colonic microflora and the development of colon tumours. Male mice (n 15 per group) were fed a FA-deficient (0 mg/kg), control (2 mg/kg) or FA-supplemented (8 mg/kg) diet for 12 weeks. Folate status was dependent on the diet (P< 0.001) and colitis-induced treatment (P= 0.04) such that mice with colitis had lower circulating folate. FA had a minimal effect on tumour initiation, growth and progression, although FA-containing diets tended to be associated with a higher tumour prevalence in DSS-treated mice (7-20 v. 0%, P= 0.08) and the development of more tumours in the distal colon of AOM-treated mice (13-83% increase, P= 0.09). Folate deficiency was associated with hyperhomocysteinaemia (P< 0.001) but homocysteine negatively correlated with tumour number (r - 0.58, P= 0.02) and load (r - 0.57, P= 0.02). FA had no effect on the intestinal microflora. The present data indicate that FA intake has no or little effect on IBD or IBD-mediated colon cancer in this model and that hyperhomocysteinaemia is a biomarker of dietary status and malabsorption rather than a cause of IBD-mediated colon cancer.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Bacteria play an important role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Unlike in Crohn's disease (CD), in which dysbiosis has been better characterised, in ulcerative colitis (UC), only small cohorts have been studied and showed conflicting data. Therefore, we evaluated in a large cohort if the microbial signature described in CD is also present in UC, and if we could characterise predominant dysbiosis in UC. To assess the functional impact of dysbiosis, we quantified the bacterial metabolites. DESIGN: The predominant microbiota from 127 UC patients and 87 age and sex-matched controls was analysed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Differences were quantitatively validated using real-time PCR. Metabolites were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Based on DGGE analysis, the microbial signature previously described in CD was not present in UC. Real-time PCR analysis revealed a lower abundance of Roseburia hominis (p<0.0001) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p<0.0001) in UC patients compared to controls. Both species showed an inverse correlation with disease activity. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were reduced in UC patients (p=0.014), but no direct correlation between SCFA and the identified bacteria was found. CONCLUSIONS: The composition of the fecal microbiota of UC patients differs from that of healthy individuals: we found a reduction in R hominis and F prausnitzii, both well-known butyrate-producing bacteria of the Firmicutes phylum. These results underscore the importance of dysbiosis in IBD but suggest that different bacterial species contribute to the pathogenesis of UC and CD.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES: Focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates are found in the upper gastrointestinal involvement of Crohn's disease, and may reflect an underlying defective innate immunity. These features, however, are also described in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection. The role of these gastric abnormalities in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease was assessed in a population with high prevalence of H. pylori infection. METHODS: Thirty-seven Crohn's disease, 26 ulcerative colitis, and 30 control patients were included. The H. pylori status was evaluated by the rapid urease test and histology. The presence of focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates was recorded. RESULTS: Focally enhanced gastritis was present in 24% of Crohn's disease patients, 4% of ulcerative colitis patients and 11.5% of controls, presenting an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn's disease of 24% and 88%, respectively. Macrophage microaggregates were found in all groups, but were only detected in ulcerative colitis and controls in association with H. pylori infection, with an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn's disease of 61% and 69%, respectively. In the absence of H. pylori infection, focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates were significantly associated with Crohn's disease (P<0.02 and P = 0.001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Focally gastritis and macrophage microaggregates are suggestive of Crohn's disease only in H. pylori-negative specimens.},

   abstract = {: The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is incompletely understood but results from a dysregulated intestinal immune response to the luminal microbiota. CD4 T cells mediate tissue injury in the inflammatory bowel disease-associated immune response. Dendritic cells (DC) generate primary T-cell responses and mediate intestinal immune tolerance to prevent overt inflammation in response to the gut microbiota. However, most information regarding function of intestinal DC has come from mouse models, and information in humans is scarce. We show here that intestinal DC subsets are skewed in ulcerative colitis (UC) in humans, with a loss of CD103 lymph-node homing DC; this intestinal DC subset preferentially generates regulatory T cells in mice. We show infiltrates of DC negative for myeloid marker CD11c, with enhanced expression of Toll-like receptors for bacterial recognition. After mixed leukocyte reaction, DC from the inflamed UC colon had an enhanced ability to generate gut-specific CD4 T cells with enhanced production of interleukin-4 but a loss of interferon gamma and interleukin-22 production. Conditioning intestinal DC with probiotic strain Lactobacillus casei Shirota in UC partially restored their normal function indicated by reduced Toll-like receptor 2/4 expression and restoration of their ability to imprint homing molecules on T cells and to generate interleukin-22 production by stimulated T cells. This study suggests that T-cell dysfunction in UC is driven by DC. T-cell responses can be manipulated indirectly through effects of bacterial conditioning on gut DC with implications for immunomodulatory effects of the commensal microbiota in vivo. Manipulation of DC to allow generation of DC-specific therapy may be beneficial in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dendritic cells regulate immune responses to microbial products and play a key role in ulcerative colitis (UC) pathology. We determined the immunomodulatory effects of probiotic strain Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) on human DC from healthy controls and active UC patients. METHODS: Human blood DC from healthy controls (control-DC) and UC patients (UC-DC) were conditioned with heat-killed LcS and used to stimulate allogeneic T cells in a 5-day mixed leucocyte reaction. RESULTS: UC-DC displayed a reduced stimulatory capacity for T cells (P < 0.05) and enhanced expression of skin-homing markers CLA and CCR4 on stimulated T cells (P < 0.05) that were negative for gut-homing marker beta7. LcS treatment restored the stimulatory capacity of UC-DC, reflecting that of control-DC. LcS treatment conditioned control-DC to induce CLA on T cells in conjunction with beta7, generating a multihoming profile, but had no effects on UC-DC. Finally, LcS treatment enhanced DC ability to induce TGFbeta production by T cells in controls but not UC patients. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a systemic, dysregulated DC function in UC that may account for the propensity of UC patients to develop cutaneous manifestations. LcS has multifunctional immunoregulatory activities depending on the inflammatory state; therapeutic effects reported in UC may be due to promotion of homeostasis.},

In an effort to counteract these characteristic perturbations, we used stem cells and/or a probiotic therapy in a murine model of Dextran Sodium Sulfate induced colitis to examine both their efficacy in ameliorating disease and impact on niche-specific microbial communities of the lower GI tract. Colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by administering 3% DSS in drinking water for 10 days prior to administering one of three treatment plans: daily probiotic (VSL#3) supplementation for 3 days, a single tail vein injection of 1x10 (6) murine mesenchymal stem cells, or both. Ileal, cecal and colonic sections were collected for microbiota and histological analyses. Microbiota profiling revealed distinct bacterial community compositions in the ileum, cecum and colon of control untreated animals, all of which were predicted in silico to be enriched for a number of discrete KEGG pathways, indicating compositional and functional niche specificity in healthy animals. DSS-treatment perturbed community composition in all three niches with ileal communities exhibiting the greatest change relative to control animals. Each treatment group exhibited treatment-specific alterations in microbiota composition in the lower GI tract, though disease scores were only improved in VSL#3-treated animals. The ileal microbiota were most profoundly altered in composition in this group of animals and characterized by significant Enterobacteriaceae enrichment compared with colitic mice (P<0.05).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: VSL#3 is a probiotic mix preparation reported to be effective in the treatment of mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis. We aimed to perform a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of studies on its efficacy. METHODS: The searched databases included PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to pool the effect- ize across studies, and the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of experiencing a specific outcome were calculated. RESULTS: Five studies with 441 patients were identified. The pooled remission rate was 49.4% (95% CI, 42.7-56.1). Only 3 low risk of bias studies with 319 patients met the inclusion criteria for further analysis. A total of 162 patients received 3.6 x 10 CFU/d VSL#3, and 157 patients received placebo. A total of 95% of patients received concomitant therapies with 5-ASA and/or immunomodulators. The Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index was used to define response and remission. A >50% decrease in the Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index was achieved in 44.6% of the VSL#3-treated patients versus 25.1% of the patients given placebo (P = 0008; OR, 2.793; 95% CI, 1.375-5.676; number needed to treat = 4-5). The response rate was 53.4% in VSL#3-treated patients versus 29.3% in patients given placebo (P < 0001; OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.89-4.83; number needed to treat = 3-4). The remission rate was 43.8% in VSL#3-treated patients versus 24.8% in patients given placebo (P = 0007; OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.48-3.88; number needed to treat = 4-5). No serious side effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: VSL#3, when added to conventional therapy at a daily dose of 3.6 x 10 CFU/d, is safe and more effective than conventional therapy alone in achieving higher response and remission rates in mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis.},

We previously identified the modulation of chemokines as a major mechanism in the protective effect of the VSL#3 in a mouse model of colitis. This was supported by in vitro studies that implicated a role for VSL#3 in the suppression of LPS-induced chemokine production by mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC). Herein, we validated these findings employing human monocyte-derived DC. Stimulation of human DC with LPS, VSL#3, or a combination of both resulted in their maturation, evident from enhanced expression of activation markers on the cell-surface, as well as the induction of various chemokines and cytokines. Interestingly, a set of LPS-induced chemokines was identified that were suppressed by VSL#3. These included CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL7, and CCL8. In silico approaches identified STAT-1 as a dominant regulator of these chemokines, and this was confirmed by demonstrating that LPS-induced phosphorylation of this transcription factor was inhibited by VSL#3. This indicates that VSL#3 may contribute to the control of inflammation by selective suppression of STAT-1 induced chemokines.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The causes of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are largely unknown. This paper reviews the epidemiological and clinical data on how medications (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogens and antibiotics), lifestyle factors (smoking, psychological stress, diet and air pollution) may precipitate clinical relapses and recurrence. Potential biological mechanisms include: increasing thrombotic tendency, imbalances in prostaglandin synthesis, alterations in the composition of gut microbiota, and mucosal damage causing increased permeability. RESULTS: The clinical epidemiological data consistently reports positive associations between smoking and relapses in CD, and inverse ones with UC. For NSAIDs and estrogens, the epidemiological findings are inconsistent, although general antibiotic use was associated with a reduced risk of relapse in CD. High levels of stress were positively associated with relapse, although psychological interventions did not have therapeutic benefits. The limited work on diet has reported sulphur-containing foods are positively associated with relapse in UC, but there is no work in CD. Ecological data reported positive correlations between air pollution levels and IBD hospitalisations. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, to clarify this area, more clinical epidemiological work is required where detailed drug types and doses, and complete dietary intakes are measured, in specific forms of IBD. Such work could provide guidance to both patients and doctors to help maintain remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment resistant chronic pouchitis causes significant morbidity. Elemental diet is effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Since pouchitis shares some similarities to Crohn's disease we hypothesised that elemental diet may be an effective treatment. METHOD: Seven pouchitis patients (with ulcerative colitis) were studied. All had active pouchitis with a pouch disease activity index (PDAI) >/=7. Exclusion criteria were recent NSAIDs, antibiotics or probiotics. Sufficient elemental diet to achieve energy requirements was provided. Flexible-pouchoscopy was performed, and the Cleveland Global Quality of Life score (CGQoL), Pouch Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and BMI were recorded at baseline and following 28 days of elemental diet. Faecal samples were also collected at these time points and analysed for major bacterial groups using culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Data were analysed using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. RESULTS: Following 28 days of exclusive elemental diet, median stool frequency decreased from 12 to 6 per day (p=0.028), median clinical PDAI decreased from 4 to 1 (p=0.039). There was no significant difference in quality of life scores or PDAI before and following treatment. There was a trend towards an increase in the concentration of Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale (median 7.9 to 8.5 log(1)(0)/g, p=0.08) following exclusive elemental diet. CONCLUSION: Treatment with four weeks elemental diet appeared to improve the symptoms of chronic pouchitis in some patients but is not an effective strategy for inducing remission. Although a potential symptom modifier, elemental diet cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of active pouchitis.},

   abstract = {The mucosal barrier has three major components, the mucus layer, the epithelial glycocalyx and the surface epithelium itself, whose integrity largely depends on tight junction function. In health, there is relatively little direct interaction between the luminal microbiota and the epithelium - the continuous mucus layer in the colon keeps the surface epithelium out of contact with bacteria and the ileo-caecal valve ensures that the distal small intestine is relatively microbe free. Most interaction takes place at the Peyer's patches in the distal ileum and their smaller colonic equivalents, the lymphoid follicles. Peyer's patches are overlain by a 'dome' epithelium, 5% of whose cells are specialised M (microfold) epithelial cells, which act as the major portal of entry for bacteria. There are no goblet cells in the dome epithelium and M cells have a very sparse glycocalyx allowing easy microbial interaction. It is intriguing that the typical age range for the onset of Crohn's disease (CD) is similar to the age at which the number of Peyer's patches is greatest. Peyer's patches are commonly the sites of the initial lesions in CD and the 'anti-pancreatic' antibody associated with CD has been shown to have as its epitope the glycoprotein 2 that is the receptor for type-1 bacterial fimbrial protein (fimH) on M cells. There are many reasons to believe that the mucosal barrier is critically important in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These include (i) associations between both CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) with genes that are relevant to the mucosal barrier; (ii) increased intestinal permeability in unaffected relatives of CD patients; (iii) increased immune reactivity against bacterial antigens, and (iv) animal models in which altered mucosal barrier, e.g. denudation of the mucus layer associated with oral dextran sulphate in rodents, induces colitis. Whilst some IBD patients may have genetic factors leading to weakening of the mucosal barrier, it is likely that environmental factors may be even more important. Some may be subtle and indirect, e.g. the effects of stress on the mucosa barrier, whilst others may be more obvious, e.g. the effect of pathogen-related gastroenteritis, known often to act as trigger for IBD relapse. We have also been very interested in the potentially harmful effects of ingested detergents - either by contamination of cutlery by inadequate rinsing or via ingestion of processed foods containing permitted emulsifiers. In vitro and ex vivo studies show that even very small trace amounts of these surfactants can greatly increase bacterial translocation. Implications for therapy are not yet so obvious. We advise our IBD patients to avoid processed foods containing emulsifiers and to rinse their dishes well - whilst accepting that there is no direct evidence yet to support this. Therapies that aim to enhance the mucosal barrier have yet to come to market, but trials of enteric-delivered phosphatidylcholine in UC are promising. The faecal concentration of mucus-degrading bacterial enzymes (particularly proteases, sulphatases and sialidases) correlates with disease activity in UC, and these represent good targets for therapy.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), including Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, have long been associated with a genetic basis, and more recently host immune responses to microbial and environmental agents. Dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis allows one to study the pathogenesis of IBD associated environmental triggers such as stress and diet, the effects of potential therapies, and the mechanisms underlying intestinal inflammation and mucosal injury. In this paper, we investigated the effects of dietary n-3 and n-6 fatty acids on the colonic mucosal inflammatory response to DNBS-induced colitis in rats. All rats were fed identical diets with the exception of different types of fatty acids [safflower oil (SO), canola oil (CO), or fish oil (FO)] for three weeks prior to exposure to intrarectal DNBS. Control rats given intrarectal ethanol continued gaining weight over the 5 day study, whereas, DNBS-treated rats fed lipid diets all lost weight with FO and CO fed rats demonstrating significant weight loss by 48 hr and rats fed SO by 72 hr. Weight gain resumed after 72 hr post DNBS, and by 5 days post DNBS, the FO group had a higher body weight than SO or CO groups. Colonic sections collected 5 days post DNBS-treatment showed focal ulceration, crypt destruction, goblet cell depletion, and mucosal infiltration of both acute and chronic inflammatory cells that differed in severity among diet groups. The SO fed group showed the most severe damage followed by the CO, and FO fed groups that showed the mildest degree of tissue injury. Similarly, colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, a marker of neutrophil activity was significantly higher in SO followed by CO fed rats, with FO fed rats having significantly lower MPO activity. These results demonstrate the use of DNBS-induced colitis, as outlined in this protocol, to determine the impact of diet in the pathogenesis of IBD.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are nowadays frequently used by patients with inflammatory bowel disease, however literature data are conflicting related to their importance. In mild to moderate ulcerative colitis probiotics can be used effectively in induction and maintaining remission, and prevention of pouchitis. As the other side of the shield, there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of probiotics in daily clinical practice in Crohn's disease. The aim of the present review is to provide help for clinicians about the probiotic use in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The comparison of literature data is limited by the large number of probiotic strains, various combined preparations, and different doses applied in the clinical studies. Small number of comparable protocols and lack of standardization encumber the analysis of study results.},

   abstract = {The clinical management of ulcerative colitis (UC) involves first treating the acute symptoms to induce remission, and then successfully maintaining it. Oral 5-aminosalicylic acids are safe and useful for maintaining remission in patients with UC. In terms of adherence, a once-daily form of 5-aminosalicylic acid is superior in maintaining remission as compared with split dosing. Patients at high risk of relapse may be candidates for treatment with thiopurines and/or biologics in the early stages of UC. Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, are effective for severe, steroid-refractory UC patients. It is suggested that these patients use thiopurines as their maintenance therapy once they achieve remission with calcineurin inhibitors. Recent studies have confirmed that biologics are effective for inducing clinical and endoscopic remission of UC, and thus they may improve long-term prognosis of UC.},

   abstract = {Decreased consumption of dietary fibers, such as cellulose, has been proposed to promote the emergence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]) where intestinal microbes are recognized to play an etiologic role. However, it is not known if transient fiber consumption during critical developmental periods may prevent consecutive intestinal inflammation. The incidence of IBD peaks in young adulthood indicating that pediatric environmental exposures may be important in the etiology of this disease group. We studied the effects of transient dietary cellulose supplementation on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis susceptibility during the pediatric period in mice. Cellulose supplementation stimulated substantial shifts in the colonic mucosal microbiome. Several bacterial taxa decreased in relative abundance (e.g., Coriobacteriaceae [p = 0.001]), and other taxa increased in abundance (e.g., Peptostreptococcaceae [p = 0.008] and Clostridiaceae [p = 0.048]). Some of these shifts persisted for 10 days following the cessation of cellulose supplementation. The changes in the gut microbiome were associated with transient trophic and anticolitic effects 10 days following the cessation of a cellulose-enriched diet, but these changes diminished by 40 days following reversal to a low cellulose diet. These findings emphasize the transient protective effect of dietary cellulose in the mammalian large bowel and highlight the potential role of dietary fibers in amelioration of intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Because ulcerative colitis (UC) repeats remission and relapse, it is necessary to keep the condition at the relapse time in mind when considering support to provide UC suffers with at the workplace. The aim of this survey was to clarify the difficulties at work and work motivation that UC suffers feel at present and experience at the worsening time, and the factors for maintaining work motivation. METHODS: We carried out an anonymous questionnaire survey of patients with present or past work experience. The difficulties at work (17 items) and work motivation (4 items) in the past week and at the time when the symptoms were most intensive during work were investigated using a newly designed questionnaire. We regarded the time in the past week as the present, and the time when the symptoms were most intensive during work as the worsening time. RESULTS: There were 70 respondents (response rate 32.0%). Their mean age was 43.8 years, and their mean age at onset was 33.8 years. All subjects, except 2 subjects after surgery, took medicine. Fifty-three (75.7%) of the subjects were in remission at the present, and most of them (91.4%) managed their physical condition well. Difficulties at work that many subjects worried about at the present were relevant to work conditions, such as "Others at workplace do not understand having an intractable and relapsing disease" (41.4%) or "Feel delayed or lack of chance of promotion or career advancement due to the disease" (38.6%). At the worsening time, the management of physical condition went wrong, and the frequency of hospital visits was increased, but few subjects consulted with superiors or colleagues at workplace. Difficulties at work that many subjects underwent at the worsening time were relevant to symptoms, such as "Feel physically tired" (80.0%) or "Decline foods or alcoholic beverages offered at business parties" (72.9%). Those who maintained work motivation even at the worsening time received no work-related consideration and had an adviser in the workplace to talk to about the disease. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that to provide UC suffers with support at the workplace, it is important to create a working atmosphere in which UC suffers can easily notify superiors and colleagues of their disease or can consult a doctor regularly, and for the superiors and colleagues to become advisors in the workplace to talk to about disease and work.},

   abstract = {IBD is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gut that demands long-lasting treatment targeting both flare-up periods and maintenance of remission. Oral systemic steroids have been used to induce remission in patients with active IBD for over 50 years due to their potent anti-inflammatory effects. The efficacy of systemic steroids in this setting has been largely demonstrated. However, the wide range of adverse events associated with these drugs has prompted the development of equally effective but less toxic steroid compounds. Currently, topically acting oral steroids are an important therapeutic option for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and microscopic colitis, being oral budesonide and oral beclomethasone established elements of the IBD armamentarium. At present, oral budesonide is the first-line therapy to induce remission in microscopic colitis and mild to moderate ileocaecal CD patients and oral beclomethasone is effective treating mild to moderate UC patients with left-sided or extensive disease. This review aims at evaluating the current role of these compounds in IBD clinical practice.},

   abstract = {The knowledge about correlation patterns between the fecal microbiota and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)-comprising the two subforms Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)-for newly diagnosed untreated children is limited. To address this knowledge gap, a selection of faecal specimens (CD, n = 27 and UC, n = 16) and non-IBD controls (n = 30) children (age < 18 years) was analysed utilising bacterial small subunit (SSU) rRNA. We found, surprising age dependence for the fecal microbiota correlating to IBD. The most pronounced patterns were that E. coli was positively (R (2) = 0.16, P = 0.05) and Bacteroidetes, negatively (R (2) = 0.15, P = 0.05) correlated to age for CD patients. For UC, we found an apparent opposite age-related disease correlation for both Bacteroides and Escherichia. In addition, there was an overrepresentation of Haemophilus for the UC children. From our, results we propose a model where the aetiology of IBD is related to an on-going immunological development in children requiring different age-dependent bacterial stimuli. The impact of our findings could be a better age stratification for understanding and treating IBD in children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile colitis have increased dramatically in the last decade. Disease severity is related to C. difficile virulence factors, including toxins A and B, as well as the patient's immune status. The intestinal mucus is an important component of innate barrier function in the intestine. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a key constituent of the intestinal mucus barrier, and exogenous PC administration has had therapeutic efficacy in patients with ulcerative colitis. We studied the protective function of exogenous PC on C. difficile toxin effects on the intestinal barrier in vitro. METHODS: Mucus-producing (HT29-MTX strain) and non-mucus-producing (HT29 strain) intestinal epithelial monolayers were cocultured with PC and C. difficile toxin A added to the apical media. Basal chamber culture supernatants were subsequently obtained, and tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6 were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In other experiments, HT29 toxin A uptake, intestinal monolayer permeability, necrosis, and actin microfilament disruption were determined. RESULTS: There was a threefold to fourfold decrease in tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6 levels and similar decreases in toxin A uptake and permeability changes in intestinal epithelial cells with mucus or PC versus control. Intestinal epithelial cell necrosis was reduced by more than 50% with either mucus or PC versus control. The integrity of HT29 cell cytoskeleton was demonstrated by both the mucus layer of the HT29-MTX strain and by exogenous PC administration by phalloidin staining of actin microfilaments. CONCLUSION: PC supplementation was effective in improving intestinal barrier defense against C. difficile toxin A challenge. PC administration may be a useful therapeutic adjunct in severe cases of C. difficile colitis or in patients who do not improve with conventional treatment.},

   abstract = {It has been presumed that aberrant immune response to intestinal microorganisms in genetically predisposed individuals may play a major role in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel disease, and there is a good deal of evidence supporting this hypothesis. Commensal enteric bacteria probably play a central role in pathogenesis, providing continuous antigenic stimulation that causes chronic intestinal injury. A strong biologic rationale supports the use of probiotics and prebiotics for inflammatory bowel disease therapy. Many probiotic strains exhibit anti-inflammatory properties through their effects on different immune cells, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion depression, and the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines. There is very strong evidence supporting the use of multispecies probiotic VSL#3 for the prevention or recurrence of postoperative pouchitis in patients. For treatment of active ulcerative colitis, as well as for maintenance therapy, the clinical evidence of efficacy is strongest for VSL#3 and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. Moreover, some prebiotics, such as germinated barley foodstuff, Psyllium or oligofructose-enriched inulin, might provide some benefit in patients with active ulcerative colitis or ulcerative colitis in remission. The results of clinical trials in the treatment of active Crohn's disease or the maintenance of its remission with probiotics and prebiotics are disappointing and do not support their use in this disease. The only exception is weak evidence of advantageous use of Saccharomyces boulardii concomitantly with medical therapy in maintenance treatment.},

   abstract = {There is increasing scientific interest in the field of vitamin D research, moving the focus beyond bone health to other disease processes. Low circulating vitamin D levels have been reported as a risk factor for several pathophysiologically divergent diseases, including cancers, diabetes, CVD, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But, therein, remains the challenge: can any single nutrient contribute to multiple complex disease mechanisms and, ultimately, have therapeutic potential? The aim of this review is to critically evaluate several strands of scientific evidence surrounding vitamin D and inflammation, primarily focusing on IBD. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased incidence of IBD and rheumatoid arthritis in countries of more northern latitudes, mirroring sunlight patterns. A considerable body of evidence supports the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, at least in animal models of IBD. Although it is accepted that suboptimal vitamin D status is common in IBD, some studies suggest that this associates with more severe disease. With regard to treatment, the data are only beginning to emerge from randomised controlled trials to suggest that people with IBD may remain in remission longer when treated with oral vitamin D. In conclusion, several strands of evidence suggest that vitamin D may modify the immune response in IBD. There is a continued need for large well-designed clinical trials and mechanistic studies to determine if, and how, this emerging promise translates into tangible clinical benefits for people with chronic debilitating diseases such as IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia seems to be a common phenomenon in both patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Many factors including deficiencies of cobalamin, folate and pyridoxine, smoking habits, alcohol and coffee intake, some medications and age may predispose subjects to hyperhomocysteinemia. The study aimed to evaluate homocysteine levels in an inflammatory bowel disease cohort as dependent of life style and disease activity. METHODS: 85 consecutive patients with inflammatory bowel disease (38 with Crohn's disease and 47 with ulcerative colitis) and 65 control subjects were included in the prospective study. The following parameters were analyzed: disease activity, duration of the disease, location of pathological changes, presence of complications, current medications, past surgical procedures, smoking history, concomitant diseases, biochemical parameters and plasma homocysteine levels. RESULTS: Mild hyperhomocysteinemia was found in 16 patients with Crohn's disease (42%), 19 patients with ulcerative colitis (40%) and 19 patients in the control group (29%) (p = 0.59). There was not any significant correlation between homocysteine level and disease activity. Only folic acid supplementation and gender affected homocysteine level. Folic acid intake led to reduction of homocysteine levels in all groups of patients (11.8 micromol/l vs. 8.33 miccromol/l, p = 0.0065 in Crohn's disease patients and 10.94 micromol/l vs. 7.78 micromol/l, p = 0.0069 in ulcerative colitis patients). CONCLUSION: Homocysteine level in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is mostly normal or slightly elevated. Disease activity does not have an impact on homocysteine level. Folic acid is the most important factor having an influence on homocysteine level in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Vitamin D promotes bone health and regulates the immune system, both important actions for pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The supplementation dose that would maintain optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25OHD >/= 32 ng/mL) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to compare two supplementation regimens' efficacy and safety in maintaining optimal 25OHD in children with IBD. DESIGN: This was a randomized, not blinded, controlled trial. SETTING: The trial was conducted in the Boston Children's Hospital Clinical and Translational Study Unit. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-three patients, aged 8-18 years with IBD and baseline 25OHD greater than 20 ng/mL were enrolled; 48 completed the study, and one withdrew for adverse events. INTERVENTION: Arm A received 400 IU of oral vitamin D2 daily (n = 32). Arm B received 1000 IU daily in the summer/fall and 2000 IU in the winter/spring (n = 31). MAIN OUTCOME: The main outcome was the probability of maintaining 25OHD of 32 ng/mL or greater in all trimonthly visits for 12 months. RESULTS: Three participants in arm A (9.4%) and three in arm B (9.7%) achieved the primary outcome (P = .97). The incidence of adverse events, all minor, did not differ. More participants in arm A developed C-reactive protein level of 1 mg/dL or greater (31% vs 10%, P = .04) and IL-6 greater than 3 pg/mL (54% vs 27%, P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral vitamin D2 doses up to 2000 IU were inadequate to maintain optimal 25OHD but were well tolerated. The finding of lower incidence of elevated inflammatory markers and cytokines among participants receiving higher vitamin D2 doses merits further study.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A total of 10-15% of patients with an ileoanal pouch develop severe pouchitis necessitating long-term use of antibiotics or pouch excision. Probiotics reduce the risk of recurrence of pouchitis, but mechanisms behind these effects are not fully understood. AIM: To examine mucosal barrier function in pouchitis, before and after probiotic supplementation and to assess composition of mucosal pouch microbiota. METHODS: Sixteen patients with severe pouchitis underwent endoscopy with biopsies of the pouch on three occasions: during active pouchitis; clinical remission by 4 weeks of antibiotics; after 8 weeks of subsequent probiotic supplementation (Ecologic 825, Winclove, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Thirteen individuals with a healthy ileoanal pouch were sampled once as controls. Ussing chambers were used to assess transmucosal passage of Escherichia coli K12, permeability to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and (5)(1)Cr-EDTA. Composition and diversity of the microbiota was analysed using Human Intestinal Tract Chip. RESULTS: Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) was significantly improved after antibiotic and probiotic supplementation. Escherichia coli K12 passage during active pouchitis [3.7 (3.4-8.5); median (IQR)] was significantly higher than in controls [1.7 (1.0-2.4); P < 0.01], did not change after antibiotic treatment [5.0 (3.3-7.1); P = ns], but was significantly reduced after subsequent probiotic supplementation [2.2 (1.7-3.3); P < 0.05]. No significant effects of antibiotics or probiotics were observed on composition of mucosal pouch microbiota; however, E. coli passage correlated with bacterial diversity (r = -0.40; P = 0.018). Microbial groups belonging to Bacteroidetes and Clostridium clusters IX, XI and XIVa were associated with healthy pouches. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics restored the mucosal barrier to E. coli and HRP in patients with pouchitis, a feasible factor in prevention of recurrence during maintenance treatment. Restored barrier function did not translate into significant changes in mucosal microbiota composition, but bacterial diversity correlated with barrier function.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. The probiotic bacterium Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) has been used to maintain and induce clinical remission in UC. Our aim was to test the effect of Ciprofloxacin and/or orally administered EcN as add-on to conventional therapies in patients with active UC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our single center double-blinded randomized placebo controlled study included patients with a Colitis Activity Index (CAI) score of at least 6. Patients were randomized to Ciprofloxacin or placebo for 1week followed by EcN or placebo for 7weeks. All 4 treatments were given as add-on treatments. RESULTS: One hundred subjects with active UC were recruited. In the per-protocol analysis we, surprisingly, found that in the group receiving placebo/EcN fewer patients, 54%, reached remission compared to the group receiving placebo/placebo, 89%, p<0.05. Among patients treated with Cipro/placebo and Cipro/EcN, 78% and 66% reached remission, respectively. Furthermore, the group receiving placebo/EcN had the largest number of withdrawals, 11 of 25 (44%), compared to 15 of 75 (20%) in any of the other groups, p<0.05. Indication of lack of mucosal healing was found in the group treated with placebo/Nissle, since only 4 (29%) of the 14 patients, who completed the study, reported no blood in stools at week 12 (p<0.02), compared to 63%, 67% and 65% in groups treated with Cipro/Nissle, Cipro/placebo and placebo/placebo, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there is no benefit in the use of E. coli Nissle as an add-on treatment to conventional therapies for active ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, treatment with E. coli Nissle without a previous antibiotic cure resulted in fewer patients reaching clinical remission.},

   abstract = {The authors revise the latest evidence in the literature regarding managing of osteoporosis in ulcerative colitis (UC), paying particular attention to the latest tendency of the research concerning the management of bone damage in the patient affected by UC. It is wise to assess vitamin D status in ulcerative colitis patients to recognize who is predisposed to low levels of vitamin D, whose deficiency has to be treated with oral or parenteral vitamin D supplementation. An adequate dietary calcium intake or supplementation and physical activity, if possible, should be guaranteed. Osteoporotic risk factors, such as smoking and excessive alcohol intake, must be avoided. Steroid has to be prescribed at the lowest possible dosage and for the shortest possible time. Moreover, conditions favoring falling have to been minimized, like carpets, low illumination, sedatives assumption, vitamin D deficiency. It is advisable to assess the fracture risk in all UC patient by the fracture assessment risk tool (FRAX((R)) tool), that calculates the ten years risk of fracture for the population aged from 40 to 90 years in many countries of the world. A high risk value could indicate the necessity of treatment, whereas a low risk value suggests a follow-up only. An intermediate risk supports the decision to prescribe bone mineral density (BMD) assessment and a subsequent patient revaluation for treatment. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry bone densitometry can be used not only for BMD measurement, but also to collect data about bone quality by the means of trabecular bone score and hip structural analysis assessment. These two indices could represent a method of interesting perspectives in evaluating bone status in patients affected by diseases like UC, which may present an impairment of bone quality as well as of bone quantity. In literature there is no strong evidence for instituting pharmacological therapy of bone impairment in UC patients for clinical indications other than those that are also applied to the patients with osteoporosis. Therefore, a reasonable advice is to consider pharmacological treatment for osteoporosis in those UC patients who already present fragility fractures, which bring a high risk of subsequent fractures. Therapy has also to be considered in patients with a high risk of fracture even if it did not yet happen, and particularly when they had long periods of corticosteroid therapy or cumulative high dosages. In patients without fragility fractures or steroid treatment, a medical decision about treatment could be guided by the FRAX tool to determine the intervention threshold. Among drugs for osteoporosis treatment, the bisphosphonates are the most studied ones, with the best and longest evidence of efficacy and safety. Despite this, several questions are still open, such as the duration of treatment, the necessity to discontinue it, the indication of therapy in young patients, particularly in those without previous fractures. Further, it has to be mentioned that a long-term bisphosphonates use in primary osteoporosis has been associated with an increased incidence of dramatic side-effects, even if uncommon, like osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical sub-trochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures. UC is a long-lasting disease and the majority of patients is relatively young. In this scenario primary prevention of fragility fracture is the best cost-effective strategy. Vitamin D supplementation, adequate calcium intake, suitable physical activity (when possible), removing of risk factors for osteoporosis like smoking, and avoiding falling are the best medical acts.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional implications of IBD.},

Goals of medical therapy include induction and maintenance of remission while preserving the colon and it's function, while minimizing the risk of treatment related morbidities. For those children who do not respond to initial therapies and progress to develop moderately-to-severely active UC, there has been a dearth of available treatments to help induce remission, necessitating long-term corticosteroid usage, with associated comorbidities of chronic steroid treatment. Significant advances have been made in medical management, including the use of biologic therapies, specifically anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha monoclonal antibodies. With the Food and Drug Administration's recent approval of the use of infliximab, a chimeric anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody, for children >/=6 years of age with moderately-to-severely active UC, care providers now have a new treatment regimen to offer this pediatric population.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the effects of resistant starch 3 (RS3) as a carrier for stachyose on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice. RS3 microspheres carrying stachyose (RS3 + stachyose) were produced and evaluated as a potentially improved colitis therapy for this study. The body weights of the mice treated with RS3 + stachyose were higher compared with those of DSS-treated control mice. RS3 + stachyose reduced the levels of the serum pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha to a greater extent compared with the same concentration of stachyose combined with ordinary starch (stachyose + starch). Histopathological examination of sections of colon tissues showed that the RS3 + stachyose group recovered well from colitis; however, the tissue sections of the stachyose + starch group presented necrosis to a more serious degree. These results suggest that stachyose with an RS3 carrier has better preventative effects on colitis than stachyose alone in mice.},

   abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate serum amino acids profile in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and impacts of graded dose of arginine or glutamine supplementation on the colitis. Using DSS-induced colitis model, which is similar to human ulcerative colitis, we determined serum profile of amino acids at day 3, 7, 10 and 12 (5 days post DSS treatment). Meanwhile, effects of graded dose of arginine (0.4%, 0.8%, and 1.5%) or glutamine (0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0%) supplementation on clinical parameters, serum amino acids, colonic tight junction proteins, colonic anti-oxidative indicators [catalase, total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)], colonic pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)] in DSS-induced colitis were fully analyzed at day 7 and 12. Additionally, the activation of signal transduction pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3K)/PI3K-protein kinase B (Akt), and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)-myosin light chain (MLC20), were analyzed using immunoblotting. Serum amino acids analysis showed that DSS treatment changed the serum contents of amino acids, such as Trp, Glu, and Gln (P<0.05). Dietary arginine or glutamine supplementation had significant (P<0.05) influence on the clinical and biochemical parameters (T-SOD, IL-17 and TNF-alpha) in colitis model. These results were associated with colonic NF-kappaB, PI3K-Akt and MLCK signaling pathways. In conclusion, arginine or glutamine could be a potential therapy for intestinal inflammatory diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease (CD) and the epidemiological associations between diet and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) implicate diet in IBD causation. There is little evidence, however, to support specific dietary changes and patients often receive contradictory advice. AIM: To review the literature on the impacts of diet on IBD causation and activity to produce guidance based on 'best available evidence'. METHOD: Review of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases from 1975 to 2012 using MeSH headings 'crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'enteral' 'diet' 'nutrition' 'fatty acid' and 'food additives'. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with a formula-defined feed is effective treatment for CD, but approximately 50% of patients relapse within 6 months of return to normal diet. There is no direct evidence of benefit from any other specific dietary modification in CD, but indirect evidence supports recommendation of a low intake of animal fat, insoluble fibre and processed fatty foods containing emulsifiers. Foods tolerated in sustained remission may not be tolerated following relapse. Some evidence supports vitamin D supplementation. In ulcerative colitis (UC), evidence is weaker, but high intakes of meat and margarine correlate with increased UC incidence and high meat intake also correlates with increased likelihood of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence from interventional studies to support specific dietary recommendations. Nevertheless, people with IBD deserve advice based on 'best available evidence' rather than no advice at all, although dietary intake should not be inappropriately restrictive. Further interventional studies of dietary manipulation are urgently required.},

   abstract = {In this paper a review of the researches on the role of Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) in gastrointestinal diseases was presented. EcN is a non-pathogenic strain of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which has probiotic properties. In a number of studies conducted among humans and experimental animals the application of EcN in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases was observed. Most studies about EcN has been devoted to this organism efficacy in ulcerative colitis treatment. Comparable results were obtained, by citied authors, in the treatment (sustaining remission) of EcN and mesalazine in ulcerative colitis. Moreover, this probiotic therapy, compared to placebo, contributes to obtaining a faster remission and improvement of intestinal histopathology. The use of EcN in Crohn's disease has not been the subject of as many studies as in the case of ulcerative colitis. Assessing the importance of EcN in treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders, authors of the studies observed, that in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, who receiving this probiotic there was a pain, nausea and bloating reduction. In studies conducted among children a positive impact of EcN in prevention and treatment of diarrhea was demonstrated. Similar results were obtained in studies conducted in experimental animals. Based on the presented review it can be concluded that the strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is useful in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, especially in treatment of ulcerative colitis. This probiotic may constitute a part of treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. The effectiveness of this strain in treatment of Crohn's disease is not clearly established and further research are require.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are intestinal disorders that comprise the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These disorders have a significant effect on the quality of life of affected patients and the increasing number of IBD cases worldwide is a growing concern. Because of the overall burden of IBD and its multifactorial etiology, efforts have been made to improve the medical management of these inflammatory conditions. The classical therapeutic strategies aim to control the exacerbated host immune response with aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biological agents. Although successful in the treatment of several CD or UC conditions, these drugs have limited effectiveness, and variable responses may culminate in unpredictable outcomes. The ideal therapy should reduce inflammation without inducing immunosuppression, and remains a challenge to health care personnel. Recently, a number of additional approaches to IBD therapy, such as new target molecules for biological agents and cellular therapy, have shown promising results. A deeper understanding of IBD pathogenesis and the availability of novel therapies are needed to improve therapeutic success. This review describes the overall key features of therapies currently employed in clinical practice as well as novel and future alternative IBD treatment methods.},

   abstract = {We evaluated the protective effect of dietary extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) polyphenol extract (PE) supplementation in the inflammatory response associated to chronic colitis model. Six-week-old mice were randomized in four dietary groups: standard diet (SD), EVOO diet and both enriched with PE (850 ppm) (SD+PE and EVOO+PE). After 30 days, animals that were exposed to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) (3%) followed by 3 weeks of drinking water developed chronic colitis, which was evaluated by disease activity index (DAI) and histology. Cell proliferation was analyzed by immunohistochemical and changes in monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Colonic expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), IkappaBalpha inhibitory and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) were determined by western blotting. SD-DSS group showed a significant increase of DAI, histological damage and cell proliferation, as well as an up-regulation of TNF-alpha, MCP-1, COX-2 and iNOS proteins. p38 and JNK MAPKs phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha degradation and PPARgamma deactivation were also observed. However, in DSS-treated and EVOO+PE-fed mice, DAI and cell proliferation were significantly reduced, as well as MCP-1, TNF-alpha, COX-2 and iNOS expression levels. In addition, this dietary group, notably down-regulated JNK phosphorylation, prevented IkappaBalpha degradation and PPARgamma deactivation. These results demonstrated, for the first time, that EVOO-PE supplementation possessed marked protective effects on experimental colitis through PPARgamma up-regulation and nuclear transcription factor-kappa B and MAPK signaling pathway inhibition, decreasing the inflammatory cascade. We concluded that PE-enriched EVOO diet could be a beneficial functional food on ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has demonstrated immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory properties in murine experimental ulcerative colitis (UC). In addition to its high monounsaturated fatty acid content, evidences have accumulated on the favorable properties of minor, although highly bioactive, components present in the unsaponifiable fraction (UF). The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of dietary EVOO's UF supplementation on acute UC. C57BL/6 mice were fed from weaning with sunflower oil (SD), EVOO diet and UF-enriched SD at 5% oil (SD+UF). After 30 days, mice were exposed to 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 5 days developing acute colitis. After 4 days of DSS removal, animals were sacrificed and colons were histological and biochemically processed. Disease activity index and microscopic damage score were significantly improved in EVOO and SD+UF dietary groups versus SD group. In addition, both dietary treatments significantly induced decreases in MCP-1 and TNF-alpha levels, iNOS and COX-2 overexpression and p38 MAPKs activation in colon mucosa. Moreover, an upregulation of IkappaB expression was also observed after feeding the animals with both diets. However, no statistically differences between data from mice fed with EVOO or UF+SD diets were observed. Dietary enrichment with EVOO's UF reduces the damage in acute colitis model, alleviating the oxidative events and returning proinflammatory proteins expression to basal levels probably through p38 MAPK and NFkappaB signalling pathways. EVOO's UF diet might provide a basis for developing a new strategy in dietary supplementation for the prevention of UC.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: Squalene is a polyunsaturated triterpene, which has exhibited anticancer and antioxidant activities among others. We investigated dietary squalene supplementation effect on an acute colitis model induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in C57BL/6 mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice were fed from weaning with squalene at 0.02% and 0.1%. After 4 weeks, mice were exposed to 3% DSS for 5 days developing acute colitis. After DSS removal (5 days), colons were histological and biochemically processed. Our results showed that dietary squalene treatment exerts anti-inflammatory action in DSS-induced acute colitis. Western blot revealed that squalene downregulated COX-2 (where COX is cyclooxygenase) and inducible nitric oxide synthase system by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways, preventing an increase in the cytokines levels. Under our experimental conditions, STAT3 and FOXP3 (where FOXP3 is forkhead box P3) were not modified and the transcriptional regulation of antioxidant and/or detoxifying enzymes, Nrf2 (where Nrf2 is nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2), was reduced in DSS-induced colitis. However, any change could be observed after squalene supplementation. CONCLUSION: Squalene was able to improve the oxidative events and returned proinflammatory proteins expression to basal levels probably through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways. However, supplementary studies are needed in order to provide a basis for developing a new dietary supplementation strategy.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are derived from traditional fermented foods, from beneficial commensals or from the environment. They act through diverse mechanisms affecting the composition or function of the commensal microbiota and by altering host epithelial and immunological responses. Certain probiotic interventions have shown promise in selected clinical conditions where aberrant microbiota have been reported, such as atopic dermatitis, necrotising enterocolitis, pouchitis and possibly irritable bowel syndrome. However, no studies have been conducted that can causally link clinical improvements to probiotic-induced microbiota changes. Whether a disease-prone microbiota pattern can be remodelled to a more robust, resilient and disease-free state by probiotic administration remains a key unanswered question. Progress in this area will be facilitated by: optimising strain, dose and product formulations, including protective commensal species; matching these formulations with selectively responsive subpopulations; and identifying ways to manipulate diet to modify bacterial profiles and metabolism.},

   abstract = {Abundant clinical and experimental evidence supports a role for resident microbiota in Crohn's disease and pouchitis, and probably in ulcerative colitis (UC). These disorders occur in areas of highest bacterial concentrations. Pouchitis and Crohn's colitis respond to antibiotics, while pouchitis and UC can be treated with probiotics. Serologic markers recognizing intestinal bacteria and yeast are present in the majority of Crohn's disease patients and may predict disease aggressiveness. Abnormal profiles of fecal and mucosally associated enteric bacteria (dysbiosis) occur in Crohn's disease, UC, pouchitis and experimental enterocolitis, with a proliferation of aggressive species that promote experimental colitis and a corresponding decrease in protective bacterial subsets. Many of these protective bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids, including butyrate, that promote epithelial barrier function, inhibit effector immune responses and induce regulatory T cell subsets. Furthermore, certain Clostridia species stimulate regulatory T cells that can inhibit intestinal inflammation. Animal models of chronic, immune-mediated enterocolitis convincingly demonstrate that enteric resident bacteria stimulate effector immune cells in susceptible hosts and that a subset of enteric bacteria has particularly aggressive activities, with host and bacterial specificity. Recent studies suggest parallel and perhaps complementary roles for enteric viruses, which have only very recently been identified.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract, whose major forms are represented by Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Their etiology is still unclear, although several factors have been identified as major determinants for induction or relapses. Among these, the role of the "forgotten organ", gut microbiota, has become more appreciated in recent years. The delicate symbiotic relationship between the gut microbiota and the host appears to be lost in IBD. In this perspective, several studies have been conducted to assess the role of prebiotics and probiotics in gut microbiota modulation. This is a minireview aimed to address in an easy format (simple questions-simple answers) some common issues about the theme. An update on the role of selected constituents of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD is presented together with the analysis of the efficacy of gut microbiota modulation by prebiotics and probiotics administration in the management of IBD.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: We investigated the protective effect of the flavonoid myricitrin in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis as promising candidate for the treatment of ulcerative colitis which is considered an important worldwide public health problem. METHODS AND RESULTS: Male CD1 mice were provided with a solution of filtered water containing 3% w/v DSS ad libitum over a 5-day period followed by 2 days with normal drinking water. Myricitrin was administered orally, once a day, at the doses 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg of body weight. At the end of day 7th, the animals were euthanized and the colonic tissue was collected to be analyzed by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Our results showed that oral treatment with myricitrin exerts consistent anti-inflammatory action in DSS-induced acute colitis in mice by the inhibition of the Akt/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-dependent phosphorylation. Consequently, the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p38, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase and of the nuclear factor B (NF-kappaB) was reduced and prevented an increase in the cytokines/chemokines levels. CONCLUSION: Together, these data reveal that the anti-inflammatory effect of myricitrin in DSS-induced colitis in mice is likely associated with its ability to prevent the activation of upstream kinases, such as phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-dependent Akt, NF-kappaB, and mitogen-activated protein kinase.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: SLC22A23 is an orphan gene in the SLC22 family of organic membrane transporters, and its single-nucleotide polymorphism rs17309827-T was recently nominally associated with intestinal inflammation in a genome-wide association study. Other polymorphisms in the SLC22A23 gene have been associated with diseases with an inflammatory component, and polymorphisms in related genes in the SLC22 family have been repeatedly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). OBJECTIVE: In a candidate-gene study using a well-phenotyped, highly monitored, Manitoban white cohort, we investigated whether variations in SLC22A23 were associated with intestinal inflammation. DESIGN: Selected genetic variations were genotyped by using fluorescent-based assays or a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 160 individuals with Crohn disease, 149 individuals with ulcerative colitis, and 142 healthy control subjects to determine genetic associations. RESULTS: Homozygocity for single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs4959235-TT and rs950318-GG was associated with IBD, whereby 6% of patients (18 of 311 cases) carried these genotypes, but they were not seen in healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Associations reported in this article add to the emerging evidence that SLC22A23 variants could modify IBD risk. However, the biology of the gene and impact of variations on the gene's functions need to be tested to validate a causative role.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether probiotics are beneficial at all stages of treatment in inflammatory bowel disease or superior to placebo remains controversial. METHODS: Two reviewers independently selected randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with controls in inflammatory bowel disease and extracted data related to remission/response rates, relapse rates, and adverse events. Subanalyses were also performed. RESULTS: Twenty-three randomized controlled trials with a total of 1763 participants met the inclusion criteria. From the meta-analysis, probiotics significantly increase the remission rates in patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) (P = 0.01, risk ratio [RR] = 1.51). The remission rates were significantly higher in patients with active UC treated with probiotics than placebo (P < 0.0001, RR = 1.80). Unfortunately, subgroup analysis found that only VSL#3 significantly increased the remission rates compared with controls in patients with active UC (P = 0.004, RR = 1.74). Interestingly, VSL#3 (P < 0.00001, RR = 0.18) also significantly reduced the clinical relapse rates for maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis. No significantly different adverse events were detected between probiotics and controls in the treatment of UC (P = 0.94, RR = 0.99) or CD (P = 0.33, RR = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of probiotics results in additional benefit in inducing remission of patients with UC. VSL#3 are beneficial for maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis. And, probiotics can provide the similar effect as 5-aminosalicylic acid on maintaining remission of UC, although no additional adverse events presented.},

Eggshell membrane (ESM) is a well-known natural bioactive material. In this study, we aim to study the anti-inflammatory activity of ESM hydro lysate (AL-PS) in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, AL-PS was shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 secretion. In vivo treatment with AL-PS was shown to reduce dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced weight loss, clinical signs of colitis and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 (p < 0.05). In addition, treatment with AL-PS also attenuated the severity of intestinal inflammation via down-regulation of IL-10 an anti-inflammatory cytokine. This validates potential benefits of AL-PS as a novel preventative target molecule for treatment of IBD.},

Here, the protective effect and its mechanism of tryptophan administration on dextran sulfate sodium -induced colitis in mice was studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty C57black6 female mice were equally divided into the control group, and treatment group. The control group received a standard CE-2 diet, while the tryptophan group received a CE-2 diet containing 0.5% l-tryptophan. After one week on this diet, all mice were orally administered a solution of 3.5% dextran sulfate sodium for 12 days to induce colitis. Changes in body weight and bloody stool frequency were monitored during dextran sulfate sodium administration. At 12 days post initial dextran sulfate sodium administration, all mice were sacrificed and the histology of their colonic tissue was examined. The nitrotyrosine levels in colonic tissues in both groups, and nitrate and nitrite levels in the urine of the control group, the tryptophan group and the group of mice without dextran sulfate sodium administration was measured. RESULTS: The tryptophan group showed significantly attenuated body weight loss, bloody stool frequency and ameliorated histological changes of colitis. While tryptophan treatment significantly reduced nitrotyrosine level in the colonic tissues, there was no significant reduction in urine nitrate and nitrite levels compared with the (dextran sulfate sodium-induced) control group. CONCLUSION: Tryptophan treatment ameliorated dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in this study. One of the anti-colitis mechanisms of tryptophan treatment is attributable to an anti-nitration effect, and may not be via the suppression of nitric oxide generation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are both typified by an altered intestinal microbiota, and gene associations imply various defects in the mucosal barrier and in the innate immune response to bacteria. This review aims to assess how alterations in diet or use of modified bacteria could have therapeutic effects in CD or UC. METHODS: A MEDLINE search using the terms 'prebiotic', 'genetically modified bacteria', 'mucosal barrier in association with ulcerative colitis', 'Crohn's disease' or 'microbiota'. RESULTS: A large body of data from in vitro and animal studies shows promise for therapeutic approaches that target the microbiota. Approaches include dietary supplementation with fermentable fibres (prebiotics) and soluble fibres that block bacterial-epithelial adherence (contrabiotics), enhancement of the mucosal barrier with phosphatidylcholine, and use of genetically modified bacteria that express IL-10 or protease inhibitors. Vitamin D supplementation also shows promise, acting via enhancement of innate immunity. Clinical trials have shown benefit with enterically delivered phosphatidylcholine supplementation in UC and near-significant benefit with vitamin D supplementation in CD. CONCLUSION: Strategies that target the microbiota or the host defence against it appear to be good prospects for therapy and deserve greater investment.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of two distinct clinical forms, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), with unknown aetiology, which nevertheless are considered to share almost identical pathophysiological backgrounds. Up to date, a full coherent mechanistic explanation for IBD is still lacking, but people start to realize that the pathogenesis of IBD involves four fundamental components: the environment, gut microbiota, the immune system and the genome. As a consequence, IBD development might be due to an altered immune response and a disrupted mechanism of host tolerance to the non-pathogenic resident microbiota, leading to an elevated inflammatory response. Considering the available data arising from the scientific literature, here reviewed, in CD, a benefit of probiotics remains unproven; in UC, a benefit of probiotics remains unproven, even if E. coli Nissle 1917 seems promising in maintaining remission and it could be considered an alternative in patients intolerant or resistant to 5-ASA preparations; in pouchitis, small controlled trials suggest a benefit from VSL no. 3 in the primary and secondary prevention of pouchitis; in IBD-associated conditions, a benefit of probiotics remains unproven. However, well-designed randomized control clinical trials are necessary to understand the undoubted role of these agents in the management of gut physiology in health and disease.},

   abstract = {A 25-year-old Iranian gentleman was admitted to hospital with severe bloody diarrhoea and abdominal pain. He had similar episodes in the past. On each occasion his symptoms developed following the consumption of the herbal weight loss supplement Hydroxycut Hardcore X. On this admission, a (CT) scan demonstrated bowel wall thickening and peri-colonic fat stranding in the sigmoid colon. On flexible sigmoidoscopy, a continuous length of congested mucosa with multiple small ulcers was seen extending up to the mid-transverse colon, in keeping with ulcerative colitis. Histological analysis of biopsies was taken at the time and confirmed this. He was started on steroids early during his admission but this only provided a transient clinical improvement. The addition of cyclosporine, which was later changed to azathioprine, did not improve his condition either. He therefore underwent an open subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy. He made a slow but steady recovery and was discharged 3 weeks later.},

   abstract = {Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS; recurrent aphthous ulcers; canker sores) belongs to the group of chronic, inflammatory, ulcerative diseases of the oral mucosa. Up to now, the etiopathogenesis of this condition remains unclear; it is, however, considered to be multifactorial. The results of currently performed studies indicate that genetically mediated disturbances of the innate and acquired immunity play an important role in the disease development. Factors that modify the immunologic response in RAS include: food allergies, vitamin and microelement deficiencies, hormonal and gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., celiac disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), some viral and bacterial infections, mechanical injuries and stress. In this paper, we presented the main etiopathogenetic factors of RAS with a special emphasis on the mechanisms of the immune response modification. Moreover, we discussed the crucial clinical symptoms and types of RAS together with epidemiologic data based on the current medical literature reports and our own observations.},

   abstract = {REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Acorn toxicity has been anecdotally reported to cause fatal colitis and colic in horses but reports in the scientific literature are sparse. OBJECTIVES: This study reports the diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and outcome of 9 cases with suspected acorn toxicity admitted to 2 referral hospitals. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Case records from 2004 to 2013 were reviewed. Horses were included in the study if they met 3 of 4 criteria: exposure to acorns; clinical and laboratory data suggesting alimentary or renal dysfunction; acorn husks in the faeces or gastrointestinal tract; and necropsy and histopathological findings consistent with acorn toxicity. Data collected included case history, clinical presentation, clinicopathological data, ultrasonographic findings, case progression, and necropsy and histopathological findings. RESULTS: Nine horses met the inclusion criteria. Five cases presenting with haemorrhagic diarrhoea deteriorated rapidly and were subjected to euthanasia or died. Four cases showed signs of colic with gas distension, displacement of the large colon and diarrhoea. Three of these (33%) survived with medical management, the fourth was subjected to euthanasia. Post mortem examination of 6 cases demonstrated submucosal oedema of the large intestine and caecum (n = 6), acute tubular nephrosis (n = 6), diffuse necrohaemorrhagic and ulcerative typhlocolitis and enteritis (n = 4), and small intestinal oedema (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Acorn ingestion may be associated with typhylocolitis leading to diarrhoea, colic and acute renal tubular nephrosis. Recovery is possible in mildly affected cases; more severe cases show hypovolaemia, intractable pain, renal dysfunction and cardiovascular failure, and often succumb to the disease process. Disease is only seen in a small proportion of the population exposed to acorns and there seems to be an increased occurrence in certain years. Further investigation into factors predisposing to disease is required, but limiting exposure to acorns in the autumn seems prudent.},

   abstract = {The involvement of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD is supported by many findings and is thus now commonly acknowledged. The imbalance in the composition of the microbiota (dysbiosis) observed in IBD patients is one of the strongest arguments and provides the rationale for a therapeutic manipulation of the gut microbiota. The tools available to achieve this goal include fecal microbiota transplantation, but antibiotics and probiotics have been the most used one until now. Although antibiotics have shown some efficacy in inducing remission in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), as well as preventing postoperative relapse in CD, they are not currently recommended for the treatment of IBD except for septic complications, notably because of long-term tolerance and ecological issues. Some probiotics have been shown to be as good as 5-aminosalicylic acid to maintain remission in mild-to-moderate UC, but have been disappointing until now in CD in all tested indications. In pouchitis, antibiotics and probiotics have shown efficacy for inducing and maintaining remission, respectively. Targeting the gut microbiota in IBD is an attractive strategy. Current efforts to better understand the host-microbiota interactions in physiological as well as disease settings might lead to the development of rational-based treatments.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 38 (28 Male; 10 Female) hospitalized patients with moderate or severe IBD (13 with Crohn's disease (CD); 25 with Ulcerative colitis (UC)) were included. At stage 1, the disease severity, clinical symptoms and, signs, food consumption and nutritional status by using subjective global assessment (SGA) were recorded. At stage 2, the patients were blindly randomized into a Study Group and Controls. In the Study Group, a standard enteral product was added into the regulated hospital diets, but for the Controls, deficits were regulated by only hospital diets for 3 weeks. the independent variables were the group, the disease and its activity, age, Body body mass index (BMI), weight loss history, the hospitalization period; the dependent variables were SGA, bowel movements, change in nutritional status, disease severity, clinical findings, and also consumption of macronutrients. RESULTS: Prevalance of malnutrition (SGA-B or SGA-C) for all the patients was 92.1% at the beginning and 71.1% at the end of study. Improvements in disease activity score for the patients with UC were statistically significant in both the Study Group and the Controls (p=0.006 for the Study Group and p=0.001 for the Controls, respectively). Macronutrients, total and water soluble fiber consumption levels improved, with statistically significant differences for all the groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is a major problem in patients with IBD. Not only the regulation of hospital food, but also enteral nutritional support, improved their levels of malnutrition, as well as their energy, macronutrients, and fiber consumption, and SGA is an easy method for nutritional monitoring.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The lumen of the gastrointestinal tract contains many substances produced from the breakdown of foodstuffs, from salivary, esophageal, intestinal, hepatic, and pancreatic secretions, and from sloughed cells present in the gastrointestinal lumen. Although these substances were traditionally regarded as waste products, there is increasing realization that many can be biologically active, either as signalling compounds or as nutrients. For example, proteins are broken down into amino acids, which are then sensed by nutrient receptors. The gut microbiome, which is at highest abundance in the ileocecum, has powerful metabolic activity, digesting and breaking down unabsorbed carbohydrates, proteins, and other ingested nutrients into phenols, amines, volatile organic compounds, methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and hydrogen sulfide into volatile fatty acids, also called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). CONCLUSION: These latter substances are the topic of this review. In this review, we will briefly discuss recent advances in the understanding SCFA production, signalling, and absorption, followed by a detailed description and discussion of trials of SCFAs, probiotics, and prebiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal disease, in particular ulcerative colitis (UC), pouchitis, short bowel syndrome, and obesity.},

The fermented sauces, particularly FSeS, significantly suppressed DSS-induced body weight loss, increased colon length, and decreased colon weight/length ratios. Histological observations suggested that the fermented sauces prevented edema, mucosal damage, and the loss of crypts induced by DSS compared to the control mice and animals fed AHSS. FSeS and FSS decreased the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-17alpha. mRNA expression of these cytokines as well as that of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in colon mucosa was also inhibited by the two sauces. Our results suggest that fermented sauces, especially FSeS, exert an anticolitic effect partially by reducing the serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines and inhibiting the mRNA expression of these factors in the colon tissue of mice treated with DSS. However, AHSS did not protect against DSS-induced colitis. In addition, low-dose treatment (4 mL/kg) with the fermented sauces resulted in greater anticolitic effects than consumption of a high quantity (8 mL/kg) of the sauces.},

Body weight, disease activity index (DAI), colon length, colon weight to length ratio, colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured. Histological changes were observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Colonic levels of tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNFalpha), interleukin(IL)1beta and IL6 were measured with an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA expression of TNFalpha, IL1beta, 6, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase2 (COX-2) in the colon tissue, was quantified by RTPCR. KME significantly suppressed DSSinduced body weight loss, colon length shortening and decreased the colon weight to length ratio. It also resulted in increased GSH and reduced MPO and MDA levels in the colon tissue. Histological observation suggested that KME prevented edema, mucosal damage and loss of crypts, which are induced by DSS. In addition, KME decreased the levels of TNFalpha, IL1beta and 6 in the colon tissues, while inhibiting the mRNA expression of these cytokines, as well as iNOS and COX2. The results of this study suggested that KME has antiinflammatory effects on DSSinduced UC in mice (C57BL/6J strain) by reducing the colonic levels and inhibiting the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines.},

   abstract = {Inadequate dietary intake of the essential trace element selenium (Se) is thought to be a risk factor for several chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. Biological actions of Se occur through low-molecular weight metabolites and through selenoproteins. Several key selenoproteins including glutathione peroxidases; selenoproteins M, P, and S; and selenium-binding protein 1 have been detected in the intestine. Interestingly, Se and antioxidant selenoproteins are known to modulate differentiation and function of immune cells and contribute to avoid excessive immune responses. This review discusses the role of Se and intestinal selenoproteins in inflammatory bowel diseases, based on data from human, animal, and in vitro studies. In humans, Se deficiency is commonly observed in patients with Crohn's disease. In animal models of experimental colitis, the Se status was negatively correlated with the severity of the disease. While the cause-effect relationship of these observations remains to be clarified, the beneficial outcome of dietary Se supplementation and an optimization of selenoprotein biosynthesis in murine inflammatory bowel disease models have led to investigations of targets and actions of Se in the gastrointestinal tract. The Se status affects gene expression, signaling pathways, and cellular functions in the small and large intestine as well as the gut microbiome composition. This data, particularly from animal experiments, hold promise that adequate dietary Se supply may counteract chronic intestinal inflammation in humans.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is supported by migration studies and increasing incidences in line with Westernisation. AIM: To give a complete overview of studies associating habitual diet with the onset or relapses in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: A structured search in Pubmed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE was performed using defined key words, including only full text papers in English language. RESULTS: Forty-one studies were identified, investigating onset (n = 35), relapses (n = 5) or both (n = 1). Several studies reported high intake of sugar or sugar-containing foods (n = 7 UC, n = 12 CD), and low intake of fruits and/or vegetables (n = 5 UC, n = 10 CD) to be associated with an increased onset risk. However, these findings could not be confirmed by similar or higher numbers of other studies. A possible protective role was found for grain-derived products in CD onset, but results were inconsistent for dietary fibre in UC and CD and grain-derived products in UC. No definite conclusions could be drawn for unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), protein and energy intake due to limited and/or inconsistent results. Six studies reported on diet and relapse risk, of which only two (n = 1 UC, n = 1 CD) had a prospective follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence is not sufficient to draw firm conclusions on the role of specific food components or nutrients in the aetiology of IBD. Furthermore, large prospective studies into the role of habitual diet as a trigger of relapses are needed, to identify new therapeutic or preventive targets.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease, a chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, presents in two variations, Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Given that treatment of CD differs from UC, a single test that provided strong diagnostic ability would offer great clinical value. Two previous studies have indicated that CD can be distinguished from UC, and that both can be distinguished from non-IBD-type gastrointestinal disease, based on urinary and faecal metabolite profiling. METHODS: Analysis of healthy as well as CD and UC patients attending an IBD clinic was performed. IBD patients were classified into two groups (CD or UC) based on chart review of clinical, endoscopic, and histological assessment. Urine samples were obtained and analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with targeted profiling techniques, followed by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. RESULTS: Based on urinary metabolomics, individuals with IBD could be differentiated from healthy. Major differences between IBD and healthy included TCA cycle intermediates, amino acids, and gut microflora metabolites. Comparison of CD and UC patients revealed discrimination, but removal of patients with the surgical intervention confounder revealed that CD could not be discriminated from UC. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential for metabolomics to distinguish IBD from the healthy state but shows that careful consideration must be given to establishing disease-representative cohorts that are free of confounding factors.},

   abstract = {AIM: Aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of a cow's milk protein (CMP) elimination diet on induction and maintenance of remission and to define association with atopy in children with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Twenty-nine consecutive patients (mean age: 11.2 years; range: 4.6-17 years; F/M: 15/14) with newly diagnosed UC were randomized either to receive a CMP elimination diet (n = 14) or to continue a free diet (n = 15) associated with concomitant steroid induction and mesalazine maintenance treatment. Children were prospectively evaluated at four time points: within 1 month, 6 months and 1 year after diagnosis or at the time of relapse. RESULTS: Twenty-five of the 29 enrolled patients responded to the UC induction therapy with a complete remission (86.2%), 13 belonging to CMP elimination diet group and 12 to free diet group (p = 0.59). Overall, our data showed that 7 of 13 (53.8%) patients treated with CMP elimination diet and 8 of 15 (53.3%) patients on free diet and UC therapy relapsed within 1 year of follow-up (p = 1). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, data of this paediatric, randomized trial suggest that CMP elimination has no role in the management of UC in non-sensitized children.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Presently, there is no consensus on endpoint measures to assess clinical outcomes for pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). This study reviewed the endpoints used in the registration trials of approved drugs for pediatric UC. METHODS: The primary efficacy endpoints of all registration trials completed from 1950 to 2008 that led to Food and Drug Administration approval for indications in pediatric and adult UC were reviewed. RESULTS: Colazal and Remicade have been approved for pediatric UC indication, and clinical response was used as a primary endpoint in these registration trials. The clinical response in the adult Colazal trials was defined as a reduction of rectal bleeding and improvement in at least one of the other assessed symptoms (stool frequency, patient functional assessment, abdominal pain, sigmoidoscopic grade, and physician's global assessment) assessed by the Sutherland UC Activity Index. The pediatric Colazal trial defined clinical response using the Modified Sutherland UC Activity Index, which excluded abdominal pain and functional assessment. Both adult and pediatric Remicade trials used clinical response defined by the Mayo score as the primary endpoint. The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index was used to measure various secondary endpoints in the pediatric Remicade trial. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric-specific endpoints were used, but outcome measures and definition of clinical response were not consistent in pediatric UC trials. Consensus on the definition of successful treatment outcome (clinical response and/or remission) and collaboration in the development of well-defined and reliable measures of signs and symptoms for use in conjunction with endoscopic parameters of mucosal healing will facilitate pediatric drug development.},

METHODS: Representatives from the US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, Health Canada, and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan convened monthly to explore existing regulatory approaches, reviewed the results of a literature search, and provided perspectives on pediatric UC drug development based on the available medical literature. RESULTS: Although pediatric UC, when compared with UC in adults, has a similar disease progression and response to intervention, the similarity of the exposure-response relation has not been adequately established. Consequently, clinical endpoints should be selected to optimally assess efficacy in children. The inclusion of a placebo control in pediatric trials to assure assay sensitivity may be appropriate under limited circumstances. In clinical studies, although the drug under investigation could provide possible direct benefit, placebo treatment should present no more than a minor increase over minimal risk to children with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Partial extrapolation of efficacy from informative adult studies may be appropriate. Placebo-controlled efficacy trials are scientifically and ethically appropriate for pediatric UC given appropriate patient selection and the use of early escape. Clinical studies in pediatric UC may include initial dose-finding studies and exposure-response modeling followed by an efficacy and safety study to further explore the exposure-response relation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There is a pressing need for drug development in pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). Lack of scientific consensus on efficacy endpoints and disease outcome assessments presents a hurdle for global drug development in pediatric UC. Scientists from 4 regulatory agencies convened an International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Working Group (i-IBD Working Group) to harmonize present thinking about various aspects of drug development in pediatric UC globally. METHODS: The i-IBD Working Group was convened in 2012 by scientists from the US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, Health Canada, and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan. The members of this group considered reasons for differences in their acceptance of efficacy endpoints and disease activity indices used in pediatric UC, reviewed the available literature, and developed consensus opinions regarding approaches for evaluating outcomes in pediatric UC trials. RESULTS: There is lack of harmonization in using efficacy endpoint and outcome assessments including disease activity indices to assess clinical benefit in pediatric UC trials. Many disease activity indices have been developed, but their biometric properties, such as responsiveness, reliability, and validity, have not been properly validated. Biomarkers, such as fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin, are being investigated for their potential as noninvasive surrogate endpoints in UC. CONCLUSIONS: Consensus on the efficacy endpoints, disease activity indices, and outcome assessments is needed for globalization of pediatric UC trials. The i-IBD Working Group offers several perspectives to facilitate harmonization across regions. The development of noninvasive biomarkers as reliable surrogate endpoints needs to be explored further.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammation-associated disease of the colon and rectum. The onset and progress of the disease are directly influenced by the nature of the intestinal microflora, the intestinal barrier function, and the immunological responses of the host. The epithelial invasion of pathogenic bacteria due to excess contact and/or barrier dysfunction is related to inflammation mediated by intestinal immune responses. Although the etiology of UC is not clearly understood, recent studies have shown a rising incidence of UC worldwide, and this phenomenon is more prominent in Asian countries and in Asian immigrants in Western countries. The increased prevalence of UC also contributes to an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Environmental factors, including changes in dietary habits, have been suggested as major risk factors of UC. A systematic review showed a negative association between UC risk and vegetable intake, whereas total fat, omega-6 fatty acids and meat intake were positively associated with an increased risk of UC. Individual dietary factors and energy balance have been suggested as having important roles in inducing changes in the microbial population and intestinal barrier integrity and in regulating inflammatory immune responses, directly or indirectly. Excess energy intake is now known to increase pathogenic microbial populations. Likewise, the application of appropriate probiotics may reverse the pathogenic progression of the disease. In the meantime, dietary anti-inflammatory compounds, including omega-3 fatty acids and other phytochemicals, may directly suppress inflammatory responses in the course of UC development. In this review, the increased prevalence of UC and its management are interpreted from the standpoint of nutritional modulation to regulate the intestinal microflora population, intestinal epithelium permeability, and inflammatory responses.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation in the absence of a recognized etiology. The primary therapies are medications that possess anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects. Given the high use of complementary alternative medicines in pediatric IBD, a prospective tolerability study of curcumin, an herbal therapy with known anti-inflammatory effects, was conducted to assess possible dosage in children with IBD. METHODS: Prospectively, patients with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis in remission or with mild disease (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] <30 or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [PUCAI] score <34) were enrolled in a tolerability study. All patients received curcumin in addition to their standard therapy. Patients initially received 500 mg twice per day for 3 weeks. Using the forced-dose titration design, doses were increased up to 1 g twice per day at week 3 for a total of 3 weeks and then titrated again to 2 g twice per day at week 6 for 3 weeks. Validated measures of disease activity, using the PUCAI and PCDAI, and the Monitoring of Side Effect System score were obtained at weeks 3, 6, and 9. RESULTS: All patients tolerated curcumin well, with the only symptom that was consistently reported during all 3 visits being an increase in gassiness, which occurred in only 2 patients. Three patients saw improvement in PUCAI/PCDAI score. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that curcumin may be used as an adjunctive therapy for individuals seeking a combination of conventional medicine and alternative medicine.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in parallel genomic processing and computational mapping have been applied to the native human microbial environment to provide a new understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease. In particular, studies of the distal gut microbiome have proposed that changes in gut microbiota are related to obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and Western diet. We examined the changes in the distal gut microbiome composition as it relates to the lean and obese phenotypes, particularly after surgical weight loss. A PubMed search of publications from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2012, used the search terms weight, obesity, microbiome, and bariatric surgery. We included studies that provided information on subjects' weight and/or body mass index and a formal assessment of the microbiome. Certain bacteria, specifically the archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii, have enhanced ability to metabolize dietary substrate, thereby increasing host energy intake and weight gain. With weight loss, there is a decrease in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla. One major finding from microbial sequencing analyses after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the comparative overabundance of Proteobacteria in the distal gut microbiome, which is distinct from the changes seen in weight loss without Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This review provides the practicing surgeon with (1) an update on the state of a rapidly innovating branch of clinical bioinformatics, specifically, the microbiome; (2) a new understanding of the microbiome changes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and weight loss; and (3) a basis for understanding further clinical applications of studies of the distal gut microbiome, such as in Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, and infectious colitis.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammation of long-term ulcerative colitis contributes to an increased risk of colon cancer. Few studies address whether extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake suppresses inflammation, cell proliferation and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) in the experimental colitis model. The aim of this study was to assess whether a 5% EVOO suppressed inflammation, increased cell proliferation and the expressions of STAT3 and STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Rats were administered DSS via drinking water (weight percentage: 4%) for 1 week with a 1-week recovery period for three cycles. Rats were divided into three groups: control group, standard diet without DSS; DSS group, standard diet+DSS; and DSS+EVOO group, EVOO diet (weight percentage: 5%)+DSS. Rats were sacrificed 5 weeks after DSS was first administered, and colonic damage was histologically and biochemically evaluated. As a result, chronic feeding of 5% EVOO attenuated inflammation. This was evaluated using a disease activity index, body weight loss and a histological score. Enhanced expressions of STAT3, pSTAT3, COX-2 and iNOS by DSS was attenuated by EVOO. In addition, EVOO attenuated increases in cell proliferation (PCNA) caused by DSS and recovered decreases in apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3). In conclusion, the study indicated that chronic feeding of 5% EVOO inhibited chronic inflammation in DSS-induced colitis in rats and also attenuated cell proliferation and recovered apoptosis in DSS colitis.},

   abstract = {Whole-grain foods such as oats may protect against colorectal cancer and have benefits on inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease. The present study aimed to systematically review the literature describing intervention studies that investigated the effects of oats or oat bran on risk factors for bowel disease. A literature search was conducted using Embase, Medline and the Cochrane library, which identified 654 potential articles. Thirty-eight articles describing twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Two studies carried out in participants with a history of colorectal adenomas found no effects of increased oat-bran intake on indirect risk makers for colorectal cancer. One of two interventions with oat bran in patients with ulcerative colitis showed small improvements in the patients' conditions. Most of the eleven studies carried out in adults with coeliac disease showed no negative effects of uncontaminated oat consumption. The fourteen studies carried out in volunteers with no history of bowel disease suggest that oats or oat bran can significantly increase stool weight and decrease constipation, but there is a lack of evidence to support a specific effect of oats on bowel function compared with other cereals. A long-term dietary intake of oats or oat bran could benefit inflammatory bowel disorders, but this remains to be proven. A protective effect on colorectal adenoma and cancer incidence has not yet been convincingly shown. The majority of patients with coeliac disease could consume up to 100 g/d of uncontaminated oats, which would increase the acceptability of, and adherence to, a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In animal models, excess luminal iron exacerbates colonic inflammation and cancer development. Moreover, in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with mild to moderate disease activity dietary fortificant iron intake is inversely related to quality of life. Here we sought to determine whether dietary iron intakes were also related to quality of life in IBD patients in remission. METHODS: Forty eight patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 42 of which had quiescent disease during this observational study, and 53 healthy control subjects completed quality of life questionnaires and 7-day food diaries. For comparative analysis, 34/group were matched and the linear relationship between dietary iron intakes (total, haem, non-haem or fortificant) and EuroQol quality of life measures was investigated. For UC patients the linear relationship between dietary iron intakes and the scores from the disease specific inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) was also considered. RESULTS: The intake of dietary iron, and its various sub-fractions, were not associated with quality of life (EuroQol) in patients with quiescent disease or in healthy control subjects. The picture was similar for the 42 quiescent UC patients when disease-specific IBDQ was used. However, the 6 patients who relapsed during the study again showed an inverse association between IBDQ and dietary iron intake (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that dietary iron does not impact on quality of life in quiescent UC patients but support that, once the disease is triggered, luminal iron may be a permissive factor for exacerbation of disease activity resulting in lower quality of life.},

Rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, acetic acid, and acetic acid+curcumin. Curcumin (100 mg/kg per day, intragastrically) was administered 10 days before the induction of colitis and was continued for two additional days. Acetic acid-induced colitis caused a significant increase in the macroscopic and microscopic tissue ranking scores as well as an elevation in colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and the number of apoptotic epithelial cells in colon tissue compared to controls. In the rat colon, immunoreactivity of phospho-p38 MAPK was increased, whereas the phospho-JNK activity was decreased following the induction of colitis. Curcumin treatment was associated with amelioration of macroscopic and microscopic colitis sores, decreased MPO activity, and decreased MDA levels in acetic acid-induced colitis. Furthermore, oral curcumin supplementation clearly prevented programmed cell death and restored immunreactivity of MAPKs in the colons of colitic rats. The results of this study suggest that oral curcumin treatment decreases colon injury and is associated with decreased inflammatory reactions, lipid peroxidation, apoptotic cell death, and modulating p38- and JNK-MAPK pathways.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Allergic colitis shows overlap with classic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Clinically, allergic colitis is associated with dysmotility and abdominal pain, and mucosal eosinophilia is characteristic. We thus aimed to characterise mucosal changes in children with allergic colitis compared with normal tissue and classic IBD, focusing on potential interaction between eosinophils and mast cells with enteric neurones. METHODS: A total of 15 children with allergic colitis, 10 with Crohn disease (CD), 10 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 10 histologically normal controls were studied. Mucosal biopsies were stained for CD3 T cells, Ki-67, eotaxin-1, and eotaxin-2. Eotaxin-2, IgE, and tryptase were localised compared with mucosal nerves, using neuronal markers neurofilament protein, neuron-specific enolase, and nerve growth factor receptor. RESULTS: Overall inflammation was greater in patients with CD and UC than in patients with allergic colitis. CD3 T-cell density was increased in patients with allergic colitis, similar to that in patients with CD but lower than in patients with UC, whereas eosinophil density was higher than in all other groups. Eotaxin-1 and -2 were localised to basolateral crypt epithelium in all specimens, with eotaxin-1+ lamina propria cells found in all of the colitis groups. Eotaxin-2+ intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) density was significantly higher in allergic colitis specimens than in all other groups. Mast cell degranulation was strikingly increased in patients with allergic colitis (12/15) compared with that in patients with UC (1/10) and CD (0/1). Tryptase and IgE colocalised on enteric neurons in patients with allergic colitis but rarely in patients with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Eotaxin-2+ IELs may contribute to the periepithelial eosinophil accumulation characteristic of allergic colitis. The colocalisation of IgE and tryptase with mucosal enteric nerves is likely to promote the dysmotility and visceral hyperalgesia classically seen in allergic gastrointestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {The etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases which include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease has not yet been clarified. Several hypotheses suggest a change in composition of gut microflora along with an impaired mucosal barrier that lead to excessive mucosal immunologic responses. Increased production of nitric oxide (NO) contributes greatly to the tissue injury caused by chronic inflammation. Evidence indicates that the mucus layer covering the epithelium is altered during UC and experimental colitis. Our aim in this study was to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of probiotic during DSS-induced colitis by modulating the immune system and colonic mucus production. For that purpose, the probiotic formulation Ultrabiotique((R)) (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifidobacterium breve) was administered daily for 7 d to mice with colitis. Probiotic supplementation improved clinical symptoms and histological alterations observed during DSS induced colitis. Ultrabiotique((R)) treatment down regulated the NO production by peritoneal macrophages of DSS-treated mice and enhanced mucus production in both DSS-treated and healthy mice. In conclusion, the modification of microflora by the Ultrabiotique((R)) played a beneficial role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier and promoted tissue repair.},

   abstract = {Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) represents a therapeutic modality that could save the life of a patient with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) facing severe nutritional problems, by restoring the patient's impaired nutritional status. TPN does not compete with enteral nutrition (EN), the latter being the first choice for all patients having anatomically intact and functionally normal digestive tract. TPN allows bowel rest while supplying adequate calorific intake and essential nutrients, and removes antigenic mucosal stimuli. The value of TPN in malnourished patients with intestinal failure due to CD is beyond doubt. However, it is difficult to suggest TPN as a sole treatment for active CD. An increased rate of remission could not be expected by applying TPN. The utility of TPN is restricted to certain cases involving efforts to close enterocutaneous or other complicated fistulas in patients with fistulizing CD, the treatment of short bowel syndrome following extensive resections for CD, or when EN is impractical for other reasons. There are no advantages of TPN therapy over EN therapy regarding fistula healing. TPN has no influence on the surgical intervention rate and little benefit by bypassing the intestinal passage could be expected. Also TPN shows no advantage if the disease is chronically active. However, an optimal supply of nutrients improves bowel motility, intestinal permeability and nutritional status, and reduces inflammatory reactions. TPN might be associated with an increased risk of adverse events, although TPN undertaken by experienced teams does not cause more complications than does EN.},

Previously, we reported that ulcerative colitis leads to systemic genotoxicity in mice. The present study was aimed at elucidating the role of alpha-lipoic acid in ulcerative colitis-associated local and systemic damage in mice. Experimental colitis was induced using 3%w/v dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water for 2 cycles. alpha-Lipoic acid was administered in a co-treatment (20, 40, 80 mg/kg bw) and post-treatment (80 mg/kg bw) schedule. Various biochemical parameters, histological evaluation, comet and micronucleus assays, immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis were employed to evaluate the effect of alpha-lipoic acid in mice with ulcerative colitis. The protective effect of alpha-lipoic acid was mediated through the modulation of nuclear factor kappa B, cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin 17, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2, NADPH: quinone oxidoreductase-1, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and connective tissue growth factor. Further, ulcerative colitis led to an increased gut permeability, plasma lipopolysaccharide level, systemic inflammation and genotoxicity in mice, which was reduced with alpha-lipoic acid treatment. The present study identifies the underlying mechanisms involved in alpha-lipoic acid-mediated protection against ulcerative colitis and the associated systemic damage in mice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In the era of modern multidisciplinary clinical management, very little is known about the prevalence and presentation of malnutrition in children with gastrointestinal disorders (GastroD) particularly employing composite, global measures of nutritional status. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Anthropometry, body composition, dietary intake, eating habits and grip strength were assessed with bedside methods in 168 patients from outpatient gastroenterology clinics (n, median (IQR) years; Crohn's disease (CD): n=53, 14.2 (11.6:15.4); ulcerative colitis (UC): n=27, 12.2 (10.7:14.2); coeliac disease: n=31, 9.3 (7.5:13.6); other GastroD: n=57, 9.8 (7.2:13.8)) and compared with 62 contemporary healthy controls (n, median (IQR): 9.8 (6.9:13.8)) and the results of the recent UK, National Diet and Nutritional Survey (NDNS). RESULTS: Children with CD had lower BMI z-scores than controls (median (IQR): -0.3 (-0.9:0.4) vs 0.3 (-0.6:1.4); P=0.02) but only 2% were classified as thin (BMI z-score <-2 s.d.). The prevalence of obesity in children with UC was 19%, 6% in CD, 11% in children with other GastroD and 15% in controls. No difference was found in grip strength measurement between groups. Except for CD children, the proportion of patients with suboptimal micronutrient intake was similar to that of controls and the cohort of children from the latest NDNS. A higher proportion of children with CD had suboptimal intake for riboflavin, vitamin B6 and calcium and consumed significantly more meat products, juices (including carbonated drinks), spreads/jams and crisps and savoury snacks and significantly fewer portions of dairy, fish, fruits and vegetables compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: GastroD affect children's body composition, growth, strength, dietary intake and eating habits, particularly CD, but to a lesser extent than expected.},

Male weanling Sprague Dawley rats were fed diets with n-6:n-3 fatty acid in the ratios of 215,50,10 or 5 for 3 months and colitis was induced by administration of dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water during last 11 days. Decreasing the dietary n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio to 10 and 5 significantly attenuated the severity of colitis as evidenced by improvements in clinical symptoms, reversal of shortening of colon length, reduced severity of anemia, preservation of colonic architecture as well as reduced colonic mucosal myeloperoxidase activity. This protection was associated with suppression of colonic mucosal proinflammatory mediators such as TNFalpha, IL-1beta and nitric oxide. These findings suggest that long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids at a level of 3.0 g/kg diet (n-6:n-3 ratio of 10) prevents dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis by suppressing the proinflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {Agaricus bisporus (white button mushroom, WBM) is widely consumed in most countries and is reported to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, little is known regarding its effects in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, which are related to dysfunction of intestinal immunity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of WBMs in an animal model of DSS-induced colitis. Male, 4-week-old ICR mice (n=10 per group) were fed a normal diet with or without 10% WBM for 4 weeks, and colitis was induced by 3% DSS in drinking water for 7 days. WBMs prevented DSS-induced shortening of colon length (P=.033) and diminished diarrhea (P=.049) and gross bleeding (P=.001), resulting in a decreased disease activity index. Results of histological analysis showed that WBMs suppressed mucosal damage. In addition, WBMs attenuated the DSS-induced increase in myeloperoxidase activity (P=.012) and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P=.020) in the colon segment. Taken together, these findings suggest a possible role for the WBM as an immunomodulator that can prevent and/or treat ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is often associated with nutritional deficiency, which appears to contribute to the progression of UC severity. The present study aimed to evaluate nutritional status and dietary intake in UC remission patients. METHODS: The present study comprised a cross-sectional study in which variables such as extent of disease (distal colitis, left-sided colitis, pancolitis), remission period, sex and age were recorded. Extent of disease was assessed by the results of a colonoscopy and dietary intake was evaluated by using 3-day, 24-h recalls. A Kruskall-Wallis test was used to compare the intake of macro- and micronutrients among the three study groups. The analysis was complemented by the Mann-Whitney test. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictive factors of extent of disease (pancolitis versus left-sided colitis versus distal colitis). RESULTS: The median (range) age of the 59 patients was 49.0 (37.0-63.0) years and 53.3% were female. Twenty-six (44.1%) patients had distal colitis, 11 (18.6%) patients had left-sided colitis and 22 (37.3%) patients had pancolitis. A high probability of an inadequate intake of fibre (100%), fat soluble vitamins (>40% for vitamin A and >95% for vitamin E), vitamin C (>34%), calcium (>90%) and magnesium (>50%) was identified in the study group. Vitamin D intake (odds ratio = 0.60; 95% confidence interval = 0.39-0.94; P < 0.05) was significantly associated with increased intestinal damage. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of individuals showed an inadequate intake of nutrients. In addition, the consumption of vitamin D was significantly associated with extent of disease.},

Lactobacillus species are a normal part of gastrointestinal flora, and bacteremia with probiotic strains of Lactobacillus is very uncommon. We describe a case of Lactobacillus bacteremia in a 17-year-old boy with ulcerative colitis managed with systemic corticosteroids and infliximab, who presented with fever to 102 degrees F, flushing, and chills 1 week after starting Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG probiotics. Initial blood culture on day 2 of his fever was positive for Lactobacillus, however, subsequent blood cultures on day 3 and 5 were negative. He was treated empirically with antibiotics for 5 days and defervesced by day 8 of his illness. 16 S rRNA sequence analysis identified the organism from the patient's blood culture and probiotic capsule as L. rhamnosus with a 99.78% match for both the strains. This case report highlights the potential risk of Lactobacillus bacteremia in immunosuppressed patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.},

METHODS: The 74-item PedsQL GI Module and 23-item PedsQL Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 584 patients and 682 parents. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (such as chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease). RESULTS: Fourteen unidimensional scales were derived measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood, diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. The PedsQL GI Module Scales evidenced excellent feasibility, excellent reliability for the Total Scale Scores (patient self-report alpha = 0.97, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.97), and good-to-excellent reliability for the 14 individual scales (patient self-report alpha = 0.67-0.94, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.77-0.95). Intercorrelations with the Generic Core Scales supported construct validity. Individual Symptoms Scales known-groups validity across 7 GI disorders was generally supported. Factor analysis supported the unidimensionality of the individual scales. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL GI Module Scales demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent measurement properties and may be used as common metrics to compare GI-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice both within and across patient groups for FGIDs and organic GI diseases.},

The secondary objective was to compare FGIDs and organic GI diseases to each other. METHODS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 587 pediatric patients with GI disorders and 685 parents of patients. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease). Ten Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring Stomach Pain, Stomach Discomfort When Eating, Food and Drink Limits, Trouble Swallowing, Heartburn and Reflux, Nausea and Vomiting, Gas and Bloating, Constipation, Blood, and Diarrhea were administered along with two Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. Five hundred and thirteen healthy children and 337 parents of healthy children completed the PedsQL Gastrointestinal Scales in an Internet panel survey. RESULTS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales distinguished between pediatric patients with FGIDs and organic GI diseases in comparison with healthy controls, supporting known-groups validity. Patients with FGIDs reported more GI symptoms and worry than patients with organic GI diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales may be utilized as common metrics across pediatric patient groups with FGIDs and organic GI diseases and healthy samples to measure GI-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2007, leading international experts in the field of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) recommended intravenous (IV) iron supplements over oral (PO) ones because of superior effectiveness and better tolerance. We aimed to determine the percentage of patients with IBD undergoing iron therapy and to assess the dynamics of iron prescription habits (IV versus PO). METHODS: We analyzed anonymized data on patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis extracted from the Helsana database. Helsana is a Swiss health insurance company providing coverage for 18% of the Swiss population (1.2 million individuals). RESULTS: In total, 629 patients with Crohn's disease (61% female) and 398 patients with ulcerative colitis (57% female) were identified; mean observation time was 31.8 months for Crohn's disease and 31.0 months for ulcerative colitis patients. Of all patients with IBD, 27.1% were prescribed iron (21.1% in males; 31.1% in females). Patients treated with steroids, immunomodulators, and/or anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs were more frequently treated with iron supplements when compared with those not treated with any medications (35.0% versus 20.9%, odds ratio, 1.94; P < 0.001). The frequency of IV iron prescriptions increased significantly from 2006 to 2009 for both genders (males: from 2.6% to 10.1%, odds ratio = 3.84, P < 0.001; females: from 5.3% to 12.1%, odds ratio = 2.26, P = 0.002), whereas the percentage of PO iron prescriptions did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-seven percent of patients with IBD were treated with iron supplements. Iron supplements administered IV were prescribed more frequently over time. These prescription habits are consistent with the implementation of guidelines on the management of iron deficiency in IBD.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major phenotypes of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) which constitute a spectrum of chronic, debilitating diseases characterised by a relapsing inflammation of the intestinal mucosal lining. Evidence from a variety of disciplines implicates the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of idiopathic IBD and their complications, including pouchitis. Many studies have reported a dysbiosis in IBD, characterised by a decrease in diversity, a decreased abundance of some dominant commensal members (such as Clostridium IV and XIVa) and an increase in detrimental bacteria (such as sulphate reducing bacteria and Escherichia coli). Therapies such as prebiotics and probiotics aim to selectively manipulate the intestinal microbiota and have been evaluated as an attractive therapeutic option with few side effects. The multispecies product VSL#3 was found effective in preventing and maintaining remission in pouchitis, whereas both VSL#3 and E. coli Nissle were effective in maintaining remission in UC. A more drastic approach to restore the composition of the microbiota and correct the underlying imbalance is a faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT has been successfully applied to treat patients with even recalcitrant Clostridium difficile infection. Particularly in UC, the majority of studies suggest that FMT may be an effective treatment option although the evidence is still limited. It is anticipated that our increasing knowledge on the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota components will allow in the future for a better selection of highly performing bacteria with specific functions required for specific benefits.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Osteopenia and increased risk for fractures in IBD result from several factors. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the dietary intake of calcium in IBD patients. METHODS: A 22-item quantitative validated frequency food questionnaire was used for quantifying dietary calcium in relation to gender and age, in 187 IBD patients, 420 normal- and 276 diseased controls. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Mann-Whitney, chi-square- and T-tests. RESULTS: The mean calcium intake was 991.0 +/- 536.0 (105.8% Recommended Daily Allowances) and 867.6 +/- 562.7 SD mg/day (93.8% RDA) in healthy and diseased controls, and 837.8 +/- 482.0 SD mg/day (92.7% RDA) in IBD, P<0.001. Calcium intake was high in celiac disease (1165.7 +/- 798.8 SD mg/day, 120% RDA), and non-significantly lower in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease (798.7 +/- 544.1 SD mg/day vs 881.9 +/- 433.0). CD and UC females, but not males, had a mean calcium intake well under RDA. In all study groups the intake was lower in patients believing that consumption of lactose-containing food induced symptoms, versus those who did not (105.8% vs 114.3% RDA in normal controls; 100.4% vs 87.6% RDA in IBD). CONCLUSIONS: Diet in IBD patients contained significantly less calcium than in healthy controls. Gender and age, more than diagnosis, are central in determining inadequate calcium intake, more so in IBD. Self-reported lactose intolerance, leading to dietary restrictions, is the single major determinant of low calcium intake. Inadequate calcium intake is present in one third of IBD patients and represents a reversible risk factor for osteoporosis, suggesting the need for tailored nutritional advice in IBD.},

   abstract = {We compared fecal microbial communities derived either from Ulcerative Colitis (UC) patients in remission (n = 4) or in relapse (n = 4), or from healthy subjects (n = 4). These communities were used for inoculation of a dynamic in vitro gut model, which contained integrated mucin-covered microcosms. We found that the microbiota of the 'mucus' largely differed from that of the 'lumen'. This was partly due to decreased mucus-associated populations of lactic acid producing bacterial populations (LAB), as LAB originating from UC patients had a significantly decreased capacity to colonize the mucin-covered microcosms as compared to those originating from healthy subjects. We found significant differences between the metabolomes of UC patients in relapse and remission, respectively, while the metabolome of patients in remission resembled that of healthy subjects. These novel findings constitute an important contribution to the understanding of the complex etiology of UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acetic acid ulcerative colitis (UC) is an experimental condition created due to intra-rectal administration of acetic acid which causes inflammation and ulceration in the lining of colon and rectum. In such condition, the colon cannot absorb liquid from the stools, resulting in larger volume of watery stools. Mesalazine is mainly used for the treatment of UC but suffers from the drawback of having poor bioavailability. UC is also characterized by alteration in colonic microflora. The present work was focused on delivering mesalazine along with probiotic, which would facilitate to refurbish customary growth of microflora. Mesalazine and probiotic were encapsulated in pectin beads with an aim to protect the drug from gastric environment and target to colonic region. METHODS: Pectin beads were prepared, formulation process was optimized for polymer concentration, drug concentration, cross-linking agent concentration. Formulation was characterized for surface morphology, in vitro drug release studies, determination of viable cell count, in vivo ulcer protective studies and stability studies. RESULTS: Average particle diameter of beads was approximately 1.44-1.72 mm. Drug entrapment efficiency was found to be optimal (78-79%). A sustained release of drug was observed for 5 h; nearly 60% of drug was released at the end of 10 h. Microbiological studies of probiotic showed best cell viability. In acetic acid induced UC model, Mesalazine-probiotic beads-treated group showed significant (p < 0.01) ulcer protection index with respect to free drug-treated group. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, mesalazine-probiotic loaded beads may serve as a useful colon specific drug delivery system for treatment of colitis.},

The pathway endows its producer with a long-term persistence phenotype in the human bowel, a probiotic activity used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, and a carcinogenic activity under host inflammatory conditions. To date, functional small molecules from this pathway have not been reported. Here we implemented a comparative metabolomics and targeted structural network analyses approach to identify a catalog of small molecules dependent on the colibactin pathway from the meningitis isolate E. coli IHE3034 and the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917. The structures of 10 pathway-dependent small molecules are proposed based on structural characterizations and network relationships. The network will provide a roadmap for the structural and functional elucidation of a variety of other small molecules encoded by the pathway. From the characterized small molecule set, in vitro bacterial growth inhibitory and mammalian CNS receptor antagonist activities are presented.},

However, primary and secondary failure are relatively frequent with all anti-TNF agents, which are available only as parenteral agents. Tofacitinib is an oral janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that inhibits JAK family kinase members, in particular JAK1 and JAK3, achieving a broad limitation of inflammation by interfering with several cytokine receptors. It first proved its efficacy as an immunosuppressive regimen after renal transplantation, and was recently approved by the FDA for rheumatoid arthritis. First data in IBD are promising, especially in ulcerative colitis. Ongoing clinical trials in both UC and Crohn's disease (CD) are needed to further explore its efficacy in CD and to better assess its safety profile.},

   abstract = {Loss of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) homeostasis and apoptosis negatively affect intestinal barrier function. Uncontrolled activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in IEC contributes to an impaired barrier and is implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the contribution of the UPR target gene C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), an apoptosis-associated transcription factor, to inflammation-related disease susceptibility remains unclear. Consistent with observations in patients with ulcerative colitis, we show that despite UPR activation in the epithelium, CHOP expression was reduced in mouse models of T-cell-mediated and bacteria-driven colitis. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of IEC-specific CHOP expression, we generated a conditional transgenic mouse model (Chop(IEC Tg/Tg)). Chop overexpression increased the susceptibility toward dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced intestinal inflammation and mucosal tissue injury. Furthermore, a delayed recovery from DSS-induced colitis and impaired closure of mechanically induced mucosal wounds was observed. Interestingly, these findings seemed to be independent of CHOP-mediated apoptosis. In vitro and in vivo cell cycle analyses rather indicated a role for CHOP in epithelial cell proliferation. In conclusion, these data show that IEC-specific overexpression impairs epithelial cell proliferation and mucosal tissue regeneration, suggesting an important role for CHOP beyond mediating apoptosis.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease that causes gastrointestinal lesions, bleeding, diarrhoea and nutritional complications. Insufficient nutrient intake can additionally deteriorate nutritional status. The present cross-sectional study aimed to determine whether UC patients adhere to national dietary guidelines and to assess their dietary habits. An online questionnaire (n 93) was used to assess health-related conditions, current nutritional knowledge, professional dietary guidance and food avoidance. A 24 h dietary recall (n 81) was used to assess nutrient intakes, which were then compared with the national recommended intake values. The results showed that the nutritional knowledge of participants was limited with unofficial sources being used, including websites. Numerous food groups, predominantly fibre-rich foods and fruit and vegetables, were largely avoided by the participants. Almost half of the study population eliminated foods such as dairy products to alleviate symptoms, possibly unnecessarily. Energy intakes were significantly (P< 0.05) lower than the national recommended intake values in women aged 18-65 years and men aged 18-60 years. Fat intake exceeded the national recommended intake values (P< 0.0001), at the expense of carbohydrate and fibre intakes, which were significantly (P< 0.005) lower than the national recommended intake values. Protein intake was significantly high in women aged 19-50 years (P< 0.00) and men aged 19-50 years (P< 0.005). Vitamin C, vitamin B12 and Ca intake levels were overachieved by all participants (P< 0.001), while women aged 19-50 years did not achieve their dietary Fe reference nutrient intake levels (P< 0.001). Osteopaenia, osteoporosis and anaemia were reported by 12, 6 and 31 % of the participants, respectively. Findings indicate that food avoidance may contribute to nutrient deficiencies in UC patients. Low intakes of these food groups, especially during remission, are preventing patients from adhering to dietary guidelines.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis is frequently an intermediate step to colon cancer. The interleukin-10 knockout mouse is a genetic model of this progression. We report that knockout mice fed 5% black raspberries (BRB) had significantly less colonic ulceration as compared with knockout mice that consumed the control diet. Dysfunction of the Wnt signaling pathway is a key event in ulcerative colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis. Therefore, we investigated the effects of BRBs on the Wnt pathway and found that the BRB-fed knockout mice exhibited a significantly lower level of beta-catenin nuclear translocation. We followed-up this observation by evaluating the effect of BRBs on selected Wnt pathway antagonists. The mRNA expression levels of wif1, sox17, and qki were diminished in the knockout mice, whereas they were expressed at normal levels in knockout mice that were fed BRBs. The lower mRNA expression of these genes in the colon from the knockout mice correlated with hypermethylation of their promoter regions; BRBs decreased their promoter methylation and increased mRNA expression of these genes. This hypomethylation was associated with elevated protein expression of key proteins/enzymes that augment methylation, for example, dnmt3b, hdac1, hdac2, and mbd2 in the knockout mice; in addition, BRBs decreased the protein expression of these proteins/enzymes. The knockout mouse model recapitulates what occurs in human ulcerative colitis. Promoter methylation of CDH1 and SFRP1 was significantly higher in human ulcerative colitis tissues compared with their adjacent normal tissues. In conclusion, our results suggest that BRBs inhibit colonic ulceration and, ultimately, colon cancer partly through inhibiting aberrant epigenetic events that dysregulate Wnt signaling.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the colon. During inflammation, NF-kappaB is increased in colonic epithelial cells and in immune cells, leading to increases in proinflammatory cytokines. These events then increase DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which silence a subset of tumor suppressor genes by promoter methylation. Negative regulators of the Wnt pathway are frequently methylated in UC, leading to dysregulation of the pathway and, potentially, to colorectal cancer. We determined if black raspberries (BRBs) influence promoter methylation of suppressors in the Wnt pathway in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC. C57BL/6J mice received 1% DSS and were fed either control or 5% BRB diets. Mice were euthanized on days 7, 14 and 28, and their colons, spleen and bone marrow were collected. Berries reduced ulceration at day 28. This was accompanied by decreased staining of macrophages and neutrophils and decreased NF-kappaB p65 nuclear localization in the colon at all time points. At day 7, BRBs demethylated the promoter of dkk3, leading to its increased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in colon, spleen and bone marrow. beta-Catenin nuclear localization, c-Myc staining as well as protein expression of DNMT3B, histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (HDAC1 and HDAC2) and methyl-binding domain 2 (MBD2) were all decreased in colon; mRNA expression of these four proteins was decreased in bone marrow cells by BRBs. These results suggest that BRBs suppress colonic ulceration by correcting promoter hypermethylation of suppressor genes in the colon, as well as in the spleen and bone marrow that systematically regulate inflammation. SUMMARY: Our results suggest that dietary BRBs suppress colonic ulceration by correcting promoter hypermethylation of suppressor genes in the colon, as well as in the spleen and bone marrow that systematically regulate inflammation in DSS-induced UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease and involves multiple etiological factors. Acetic acid (AA)-induced colitis is a reproducible and simple model, sharing many characteristics with human colitis. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been widely used as an antioxidant in vivo and in vitro. NAC can affect several signaling pathways involving in apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell growth and arrest, redox-regulated gene expression, and inflammatory response. Therefore, NAC may not only protect against the direct injurious effects of oxidants, but also beneficially alter inflammatory events in colitis. This study was conducted to investigate whether NAC could alleviate the AA-induced colitis in a porcine model. METHODS: Weaned piglets were used to investigate the effects of NAC on AA-induced colitis. Severity of colitis was evaluated by colon histomorphology measurements, histopathology scores, tissue myeloperoxidase activity, as well as concentrations of malondialdehyde and pro-inflammatory mediators in the plasma and colon. The protective role of NAC was assessed by measurements of antioxidant status, growth modulator, cell apoptosis, and tight junction proteins. Abundances of caspase-3 and claudin-1 proteins in colonic mucosae were determined by the Western blot method. Epidermal growth factor receptor, amphiregulin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mRNA levels in colonic mucosae were quantified using the real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, AA treatment increased (P < 0.05) the histopathology scores, intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) numbers and density in the colon, myeloperoxidase activity, the concentrations of malondialdehyde and pro-inflammatory mediators in the plasma and colon, while reducing (P < 0.05) goblet cell numbers and the protein/DNA ratio in the colonic mucosa. These adverse effects of AA were partially ameliorated (P < 0.05) by dietary supplementation with NAC. In addition, NAC prevented the AA-induced increase in caspase-3 protein, while stimulating claudin-1 protein expression in the colonic mucosa. Moreover, NAC enhanced mRNA levels for epidermal growth factor and amphiregulin in the colonic mucosa. CONCLUSION: Dietary supplementation with NAC can alleviate AA-induced colitis in a porcine model through regulating anti-oxidative responses, cell apoptosis, and EGF gene expression.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate potential risk factors in the development of ulcerative colitis (UC) in China. METHODS: A total of 1308 patients with UC and 1308 age-matched and sex-matched controls were prospectively studied in China. The UC cases were collected from 17 hospitals in China from April 2007 to April 2010. Uniform questionnaires were designed to investigate risk factors including smoking, appendectomy, stress, socio-economic conditions, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral contraceptives, diet, breastfeeding, infections and family sanitary conditions. Group comparisons by each factor were done using simple logistic regression analysis. Conditional logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: By univariate analysis, the variables predictive of UC included feeling stress, light and heavy alcoholic drinking, spicy food, sugar consumption and infectious diarrhea, while heavy tea intake and tap water consumption were protective against UC. On multivariate analysis, the protective factor for UC was tap water consumption [odds ratios (OR) = 0.424, 95%CI: 0.302-0.594, P < 0.001]; while the potential risk factors for UC were heavy sugar consumption (OR = 1.632, 95%CI: 1.156-2.305, P < 0.001), spicy food (light intake: OR = 3.329, 95%CI: 2.282-4.857, P < 0.001; heavy intake: OR = 3.979, 95%CI: 2.700-5.863, P < 0.001), and often feeling stress (OR = 1.981, 95%CI: 1.447-2.711, P < 0.001). Other factors, such as smoking habit, appendectomy, breastfeeding, a history of measles, rural or urban residence, education, oral contraceptives, and NSAID use have not been found to have a significant association with the development of UC in the present study. CONCLUSION: Our study showed tap water consumption was a protective factor for UC, while spicy food, heavy sugar consumption and often feeling stress were risk factors for UC in this Chinese population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary fiber may favorably influence fermentation, gastrointestinal inflammation, and disease progression in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and pouchitis and offer an attractive therapeutic addition to pharmacological treatment. This systematic review appraised data from randomized controlled trials of fiber in the management of inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The review followed Cochrane and PRISMA recommendations. Seven electronic databases were searched along with hand searching and contacting experts. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of the effects of fiber on clinical endpoints (primarily disease activity for treatment or maintenance) or physiological outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: In total, 23 randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria (UC, 10; Crohn's disease, 12; and pouchitis, 1) recruiting 1296 patients. In UC, 3/10 studies reported fiber supplementation to benefit disease outcomes. In Crohn's disease, 0/12 studies and in pouchitis 1/1 study reported a benefit on disease activity. Despite this, a number of studies reported favorable intragroup effects on physiological outcomes including fecal butyrate, fecal calprotectin, inflammatory cytokines, microbiota, and gastrointestinal symptom indices. Meta-analysis was not possible. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited weak evidence for the efficacy of fiber in improving disease outcomes in UC and pouchitis. The potential antiinflammatory role of fiber is intriguing and merits further investigation in adequately powered clinical trials. Excluding overt gastrointestinal obstruction, there was no evidence that fiber intake should be restricted in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is direct evidence that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves the gastrointestinal microbiota and some evidence that the microbiota might also play a similar role in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of this article is to review the emerging evidence for the mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is strongly influenced by factors including age, diet and disease. Probiotics may be effective through their impact on the host gastrointestinal microbiota and promotion of mucosal immunoregulation. Probiotics are considered to be well tolerated, although the quality of studies and health claims has been variable. There are many short-term studies demonstrating the effectiveness of probiotics in IBS, although recommendations should be made for specific strains and for specific symptoms. Within IBD, a number of trials have shown the benefits of a range of probiotics in pouchitis and in ulcerative colitis, although current evidence in Crohn's disease is less promising. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics have considerable potential in the management of IBS and IBD; however, the benefits are strain specific. High-quality trials of probiotics in gastrointestinal disorders as well as laboratory investigations of their mechanism of action are required in order to understand who responds and why.},

   abstract = {The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is moving from the Crohn's Disease Activity Index to patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and objective measures of disease, such as findings from endoscopy. PROs will become an important aspect of assessing activity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and for labeling specific drugs for this disease. PROs always have been considered in the management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis, and have included measurements of quality of life, disability, or fatigue. Several disease-specific scales have been developed to assess these PROs and commonly are used in clinical trials. Outcomes reported by patients in clinical trials of IBD initially focused on quality of life, measured by the Short-Form 36 questionnaire or disease-specific scales such as the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire or its shorter version. Recently considered factors include fatigue, depression and anxiety, and work productivity, as measured by the Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, the Hospital Anxiety Depression, and the Work Productivity Activity Impairment Questionnaire, respectively. However, few data are available on how treatment affects these factors in patients with IBD. Although disability generally is recognized in patients with IBD, it is not measured. The international IBD disability index currently is being validated. None of the PROs currently used in IBD were developed according to FDA guidance for PRO development. PROs will be a major primary end point of future trials. FDA guidance is needed to develop additional PROs for IBD that can be incorporated into trials, to better compare patients' experience with different therapies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of high- and low-dose oral, delayed-release mesalamine in a randomized, double-blind, active control study of children with mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Patients ages 5 to 17 years, with a Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) score of >/= 10 to </= 55 and a truncated Mayo Score of >/= 1 for both rectal bleeding and stool frequency, were enrolled. They received body weight-dependent doses of oral, delayed-release mesalamine for 6 weeks in a low- (27-71 mg . g(-1) . day(-1)) or high-dose group (53-118 mg . g(-1) . day(-1)). The primary endpoint was treatment success, defined as the proportion of patients who achieved remission (PUCAI score <10) or partial response (PUCAI score >/= 10 with a decrease from baseline by >/= 20 points). Secondary endpoints included truncated Mayo Score and global assessment of change of disease activity. RESULTS: The modified intent-to-treat population included 81 of 83 patients enrolled. Treatment success by PUCAI was achieved by 23 of 41 (56%) and 22 of 40 (55%) patients in the mesalamine low- and high-dose groups, respectively (P = 0.924). Truncated Mayo Score (low-dose 30 [73%] and high-dose 28 [70%] patients) and other efficacy results did not differ between the groups. The type and severity of adverse events were consistent with those reported in previous studies of adults with ulcerative colitis and did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both low- and high-dose oral, delayed-release mesalamine doses were equally effective as short-term treatment of mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis in children, without a specific benefit or risk to using either dose.},

   abstract = {The crude powder of the fruit of Arctium lappa L. (ALF) has previously been reported to attenuate experimental colitis in mice. But, its main effective ingredient and underlying mechanisms remain to be identified. In this study, ALF was extracted with ethanol, and then successively fractionated into petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and water fraction. Experimental colitis was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice. Among the four fractions of ALF, the ethyl acetate fraction showed the most significant inhibition of DSS-induced colitis in mice. The comparative studies of arctigenin and arctiin (the two main ingredients of ethyl acetate fraction) indicated that arctigenin rather than arctiin could reduce the loss of body weight, disease activity index and histological damage in the colon. Arctigenin markedly recovered the loss of intestinal epithelial cells (E-cadherin-positive cells) and decreased the infiltration of neutrophils (MPO-positive cells) and macrophages (CD68-positive cells). Arctigenin could down-regulate the expressions of TNF-alpha, IL-6, MIP-2, MCP-1, MAdCAM-1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 at both protein and mRNA levels in colonic tissues. Also, it markedly decreased the MDA level, but increased SOD activity and the GSH level. Of note, the efficacy of arctigenin was comparable or even superior to that of the positive control mesalazine. Moreover, it significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of MAPKs and the activation of NF-kappaB, including phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and p65, p65 translocation and DNA binding activity. In conclusion, arctigenin but not arctiin is the main active ingredient of ALF for attenuating colitis via down-regulating the activation of MAPK and NF-kappaB pathways.},

   abstract = {The peptide transporter PEPT1, expressed in the brush border membrane of enterocytes, mediates the uptake of di- and tripeptides from luminal protein digestion in the small intestine. PEPT1 was proposed not to be expressed in normal colonic mucosa but may become detectable in inflammatory states such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. We reassessed colonic expression of PEPT1 by performing a systematic analysis of PEPT1 mRNA and protein levels in healthy colonic tissues in mice, rats, and humans. Immunofluorescence analysis of different mouse strains (C57BL/6N, 129/Sv, BALB/c) demonstrated the presence of PEPT1 in the distal part of the colon but not in proximal colon. Rat and human intestines display a similar distribution of PEPT1 as found in mice. However, localization in human sigmoid colon revealed immunoreactivity present at low levels in apical membranes but substantial staining in distinct intracellular compartments. Functional activity of PEPT1 in colonic tissues from mice was assessed in everted sac preparations using [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar and found to be 5.7-fold higher in distal compared with proximal colon. In intestinal tissues from Pept1-/- mice, no [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar transport was detectable but feces samples revealed significantly higher water content than in wild-type mice, suggesting that PEPT1 contributes to colonic water absorption. In conclusion, our studies unequivocally demonstrate the presence of PEPT1 protein in healthy distal colonic epithelium in mice, rats, and humans and proved that the protein is functional and contributes to electrolyte and water handling in mice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: PEPT1 was proposed to be expressed only in inflamed colonic tissues in which it could contribute to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development by transporting bacterial peptides, such as muramyl dipeptide (MDP), that activate intracellular pattern recognition receptors, such as the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain 2. To better define the pathological relevance of this transporter, we analyzed PEPT1 expression during intestinal inflammation and studied the susceptibility of Pept1-deficient (Pept1) mice to experimental colitis. METHODS: Wild-type and Pept1 mice were treated with dextran sulfate sodium and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid to induce colitis, and MDP-induced cytokine expression was studied in colonic tissue cultures. PEPT1 expression was characterized in mouse models of Crohn's disease-like ileitis (Tnf) or colitis (Il-10, Il-10XTlr2) and endoscopic tissue samples from descending colon of patients with IBD (n = 11) and controls (n = 17). Moreover, the prevalence of the PEPT1 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2297322 was tested in German patients with IBD (n = 458) and controls (n = 452). RESULTS: PEPT1 expression was consistently reduced under condition of acute or chronic experimental inflammation. Wild-type and Pept1 mice revealed comparable susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium-induced and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis, and MDP-induced cytokine expression was PEPT1-independent. PEPT1 expression levels were also decreased in descending colon of patients with IBD during acute inflammation, but the rs2297322 single-nucleotide polymorphism was not associated with IBD susceptibility in the German cohort. CONCLUSIONS: PEPT1 expression is reduced during intestinal inflammation and PEPT1 is neither required for MDP-induced immune response nor is the PEPT1 rs2297322 single-nucleotide polymorphism associated with IBD susceptibility in our German cohort. These data strongly argue against a primary role of PEPT1 in the initiation or progression of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: We previously identified an anti-inflammatory compound, zonarol, a hydroquinone isolated from the brown algae Dictyopteris undulata as a marine natural product. To ascertain the in vivo functions of zonarol, we examined the pharmacological effects of zonarol administration on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced inflammation in a mouse model of ulcerative colitis (UC). Our goal is to establish a safe and effective cure for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using zonarol. METHODS AND RESULTS: We subjected Slc:ICR mice to the administration of 2% DSS in drinking water for 14 days. At the same time, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) at a dose of 50 mg/kg (positive control) and zonarol at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg, were given orally once a day. DSS-treated animals developed symptoms similar to those of human UC, such as severe bloody diarrhea, which were evaluated by the disease activity index (DAI). Treatment with 20 mg/kg of zonarol, as well as 5-ASA, significantly suppressed the DAI score, and also led to a reduced colonic ulcer length and/or mucosal inflammatory infiltration by various immune cells, especially macrophages. Zonarol treatment significantly reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules, and prevented the apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. Finally, zonarol protected against in vitro lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation in the RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cell line. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that a marine bioproduct protects against experimental UC via the inhibition of both inflammation and apoptosis, very similar to the standard-of-care sulfasalazine, a well-known prodrug that releases 5-ASA. We believe that the oral administration of zonarol might offer a better treatment for human IBDs than 5-ASA, or may be useful as an alternative/additive therapeutic strategy against UC, without any evidence of side effects.},

   abstract = {Mixed linear models are emerging as a method of choice for conducting genetic association studies in humans and other organisms. The advantages of the mixed-linear-model association (MLMA) method include the prevention of false positive associations due to population or relatedness structure and an increase in power obtained through the application of a correction that is specific to this structure. An underappreciated point is that MLMA can also increase power in studies without sample structure by implicitly conditioning on associated loci other than the candidate locus. Numerous variations on the standard MLMA approach have recently been published, with a focus on reducing computational cost. These advances provide researchers applying MLMA methods with many options to choose from, but we caution that MLMA methods are still subject to potential pitfalls. Here we describe and quantify the advantages and pitfalls of MLMA methods as a function of study design and provide recommendations for the application of these methods in practical settings.},

   abstract = {Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key components of the innate immune system which trigger antimicrobial host defense responses. This study aimed to investigate the impact of probiotics (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium) on the expression of TLR4 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the colon mucosa of rat experimental ulcerative colitis model induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)/ethanol and immune complexes. The gross and histological changes of the colonic mucosa were observed and assessed by the means-standard deviation and independent samples t-test. The protein expression levels of TLR4 and TNF-alpha were detected by using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, respectively. It was revealed that there was visible infiltration of inflammatory cells, formation of crypt abscess, and the reduction of goblet cells in the colon tissue of experimental models. As compared with the control group, the levels of TLR4 and TNF-alpha protein were significantly increased in the model group (P<0.01 for both). No significant difference was found in the expression of TLR4 and TNF-alpha between the two-week probiotics treatment group and the model group (P>0.05), whereas significant reductions were shown in rats which were treated with probiotics for four weeks as compared with the model group (P<0.01). There was no significant difference between two probiotics-treated groups. Our results implied that probiotics were likely to play a key role in protecting ulcerative colitis by reducing the inflammatory factor TNF-alpha expression through inhibiting the TLR4 expression in the colon tissue of experimental models.},

Strong evidence indicates n-3 PUFAs are beneficial as a dietary supplement in certain diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis; however for other conditions such as asthma, the data are less robust. A clearer understanding of the pharmacology of n-3 PUFAs will help to establish targets to modulate chronic inflammatory diseases.},

   abstract = {Cumulative evidence has now demonstrated the stimulation of mucosal mast cells by both allergic and non-allergic triggers and their inhibition as a potential therapeutic target in many diseases like food allergy and ulcerative colitis. Hence, we screened medicinal plants from Pakistan against antigen- and ionophore-induced degranulation of mucosal mast cells. Aqueous ethanol extracts were screened. IgE/antigen- and A23187-induced degranulation of mucosal-type murine bone marrow derived mast cells (mBMMCs) were screening assays and beta-hexosaminidase released from degranulated mBMMCs was measured. Real time-polymerase chain reaction was employed to examine the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-4 mRNA. Acetoxychavicol acetate, was examined by degranulation assays and real time-PCR. Among the ten plants screened against IgE/antigen stimulated degranulation, five plants; Alpinia galangal, Mentha arvensis, Myrtus communis, Polygonum bistorta and Syzygium aromaticum demonstrated significant (p<0.01) suppression of the degranulation at 100 mug/ml. Of them, Alpinia galangal showed significant (p<0.01) inhibition at 32 mg/ml. In A23187-induced degranulation, all plants showed significant (p<0.01) inhibition at 100 mug/ml except Tamarix dioica. Again Alpinia galangal exhibited significant (p<0.01) suppression at 32 mug/ml. In a concentration dependent assay, Alpinia galangal revealed significant suppression at 10 mug/ml against A23187-stimulated degranulation. Acetoxychavicol acetate demonstrated significant (p<0.01) inhibition at 3.2 muM in IgE/antigen-treated cells and at 10 muM in A23187-treated cells. Furthermore, both Alpinia galangal and acetoxychavicol acetate suppressed the IgE/antigen- and A23187-enhanced mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-a and IL-4, in mBMMCs. Our findings revealed the suppressive effect of Alpinia galangal and acetoxychavicol acetate on degranulation of mBMMCs by allergic and non-allergic stimuli, which can be utilized for future drug development against food allergy or ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Fatigue, weakness and musculoskeletal manifestations are associated with IBD. An impaired nutritional status and a reduced physical activity can contribute to these clinical outcomes, impacting quality of life and increasing disability. This study aims to assess muscle strength and lower limb physical performance in female UC patients, taking into consideration disease activity, body composition and habitual physical activity. METHODS: A case-control study was performed including 23 UC female outpatients and 23 age- and BMI-matched healthy women as controls. Quadriceps strength (QS), handgrip strength (HGS), physical performance based measures (five repetitions sit-up test and 4meter gait speed test), body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis, anthropometry), and habitual physical activity (HPA) levels were assessed. RESULTS: UC group had decreased QS (-6%; P=0.012), slower sit-up test (-32%; P=0.000), slower gait speed (-17% P=0.002) and decreased HPA level (-30%, P=0.001) compared with controls. No difference in HGS was observed between groups. Logistic regression showed that UC was an independent factor for decreased QS and slower sit-up test, while HPA was a protective factor for impaired gait speed. Multivariate linear regression showed that BMI was independently associated with an improved QS and slower sit-up test in the UC group. CONCLUSION: Women with UC had decreased lower limb strength and mobility limitations, which were associated with BMI and the level of physical activity. Early evaluation of nutritional status and performance of the lower limbs could identify UC patients with pre-clinical disability who may benefit from earlier health lifestyle modifications.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence supports an immunologic role for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here we examined if pretreatment vitamin D status influences durability of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: All IBD patients who had plasma 25(OH)D level checked <3 months prior to initiating anti-TNF-alpha therapy were included in this retrospective single-center cohort study. Our main predictor variable was insufficient plasma 25(OH)D (<30 ng/mL). Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for potential confounders was used to identify the independent effect of pretreatment vitamin D on biologic treatment cessation. RESULTS: Our study included 101 IBD patients (74 CD; median disease duration 9 years). The median index 25(OH)D level was 27 ng/mL (interquartile range, 20-33 ng/mL). One-third of the patients had prior exposure to anti-TNF-alpha therapy. On multivariate analysis, patients with insufficient vitamin D demonstrated earlier cessation of anti-TNF-alpha therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-4.39; P = .04). This effect was significant in patients who stopped treatment for loss of response (HR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.34-9.09) and stronger for CD (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 0.95-5.99) than UC (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that vitamin D levels may influence durability of anti-TNF-alpha induction and maintenance therapy. Larger cohort studies and clinical trials of supplemental vitamin D use with disease activity as an end point may be warranted.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most commonly ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Patients affected with IBD experience symptoms including abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and weight loss. There is no cure for IBD; thus treatments typically focus on preventing complications, inducing and maintaining remission, and improving quality of life. During IBD, dysregulation of the intestinal immune system leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, and recruitment of activated immune cells to the intestine, causing tissue damage and perpetuating the inflammatory response. Recent biological therapies targeting specific inflammatory cytokines or pathways, in particular TNF-alpha, have shown promise, but not all patients respond to treatment, and some individuals become intolerant to treatment over time. Dietary peptides and amino acids (AAs) have been shown to modulate intestinal immune functions and influence inflammatory responses, and may be useful as alternative or ancillary treatments in IBD. This review focuses on dietary interventions for IBD treatment, in particular the role of dietary peptides and AAs in reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the gut, as well as recent advances in the cellular mechanisms responsible for their anti-inflammatory activity.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of probiotics on regulating T regulatory cells and reducing the severity of experimental colitis in mice. METHODS: Forty C57/BL mice were randomly divided into four groups. Colitis was induced in the mice using 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). After 10-d treatment with Bifico capsules (combined bifidobacterium, lactobacillus and enterococcus), body weight, colonic weight, colonic weight index, length of colon, and histological scores were evaluated. CD4+CD25+Foxp3+T cell in mesenteric lymph nodes were measured by flow cytometry, and cytokines in colonic tissue homogenates were analyzed by a cytometric bead array. RESULTS: The colonic weight index and the colonic weight of colitis mice treated with Bifico were lower than that of TNBS-induced mice without treatment. However, colonic length and percent of body weight amplification were higher than in TNBS-induced mice without treatment. Compared with TNBS-induced mice without treatment, the level of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes, the expression of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and IL-10 in colonic tissues from colitis mice treated with Bifico were upregulated, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma were downregulated. CONCLUSION: Probiotics effectively treat experimental colitis by increasing CD4+CD25+Foxp3+T cell and regulating the balance of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in the colonic mucosa.},
