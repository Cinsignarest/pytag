   abstract = {Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are highly prevalent among subjects seeking medical attention at the general practitioner or specialist level. While IBS lacks any disease associated excess mortality, this disorders is relevant to the affected subjects due to the considerable burden with regard to the symptoms and an impaired quality of life. Furthermore, this disease has a substantial impact on society due to the economical consequences. In recent years substantial progress has been achieved regarding our pathophysiological understanding. However, as usual, there has been a substantial delay between the discovery of disease mechanisms and its translation into improved patient care. For diagnosing IBS standardized criteria have been established (i. e. Rome II- or the DGVS-criteria). Regarding treatment, life style advice such as avoidance of specific nutrients that precipitate or aggravate or the "little psychotherapy" (addressing patients concerns and anxiety regarding the symptoms) are considered essential. However, the overall response rate is disappointing. Evidence-based pharmacological interventions include herbal preparations, spasmolytics, low dose tricyclic antidepressants and 5-HT-3-receptor antagonists and 5-HT-4-receptor agonists. At present no cure for patients with IBS exists. Thus, all currently available treatments target palliation of symptoms. This, however, may change in the future.},

   abstract = {Hypersensitivity to rectal or colonic distension characterizes most patients with IBS and increased gut permeability has been described in post-dysenteric IBS patients. However, no link has been established between these two events. The aim of this study was to determine (i) whether chemical blockade of stress-induced increase of colonic paracellular permeability by 2,4,6 triaminopyrimidine (TAP) affects the concomitant hypersensitivity to colonic distension, (ii) the role of epithelial cell contraction in the stress-induced increased permeability and hyperalgesia, using a myosin light chain kinase inhibitor (ML-7). The effect of acute partial restraint stress (PRS) on visceral sensitivity to colorectal distension (RD) was assessed by abdominal muscle electromyography. Colonic paracellular permeability was determined by measuring percentage of urinary 51Cr-EDTA recovery after intracolonic infusion. The effect of stress on both parameters was evaluated after TAP, ML-7 or vehicle pretreated animals. PRS significantly increased colonic paracellular permeability and the number of spike bursts for all volumes of RD applied compared to sham. TAP suppressed the stress-induced increase of colonic paracellular permeability and sensitivity to colonic distension. Similarly, ML-7 blocked the stress-induced increase of colonic paracellular permeability and sensitivity. Neither ML-7 nor TAP had any effect on both permeability and sensitivity in absence of stress. The increase of colonic permeability induced by PRS results from epithelial cell cytoskeleton contraction through myosin light chain kinase activation and this increase is responsible for stress-induced rectal hypersensitivity.},

   abstract = {Studies have shown that early enteral nutrition in critically ill patients reduces the incidence of morbidity and death. Nonetheless, intolerance to gastric enteral nutrition is common in these patients as a result of gastroparesis. The use of prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide, domperidone, cisapride, and erythromycin can improve gastric emptying, but these agents are not without deleterious adverse effects. Tegaserod, a selective serotonin type 4 receptor partial agonist, was recently approved for treatment of women with irritable bowel syndrome. On the basis of tegaserod's mechanism of action, it was hypothesized that tegaserod may accelerate the return of gastric function in intensive care unit patients with gastroparesis. It would thus provide an additional agent for the management of gastroparesis with a more favorable safety profile. We present 3 case reports of the successful use of tegaserod in intensive care unit patients with impaired gastric motility. To our knowledge, the use of tegaserod in this setting has not been reported or studied previously.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been proposed as important pharmaco-nutrients for modulating mucosal immunity and therapeutic responses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We evaluated the ability of CLA and n-3 PUFA alone or in combination to modulate IBD in a pig model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. METHODS: Sixty-four, 15-day-old pigs were used to evaluate the effect of CLA, n-3 PUFA and a 50:50 mixture of CLA and n-3 PUFA on growth, clinical activity and colonic PPAR-responsive gene expression. Diets were formulated to contain: 1.33% soybean oil (control); 1.33% CLA; 1.33% fish oil; or 1.33% of a 50:50 mixture of CLA and fish oil. Intestinal inflammation was induced by an intragastric challenge with DSS on day 42 of dietary supplementation. The colonic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), PPAR gamma- and delta-responsive genes, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) were assayed by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: The onset of IBD was delayed, colitis less severe and growth suppression attenuated in pigs fed CLA, which correlated with induction of colonic PPAR gamma and its responsive gene PPAR gamma-coactivator-1alpha (PGC1-alpha) and downregulation of TNF-alpha. However, dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFA alone or in combination with CLA resulted in an early onset of disease (i.e., day 2) and faster recovery on days 6 and 7, which correlated with a marked induction of the PPAR delta-responsive gene uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3). CLA and n-3 PUFA acted synergistically to upregulate colonic KGF expression in DSS-challenged pigs but n-3 PUFA blocked CLA-induced PPAR gamma activation. CONCLUSION: Dietary CLA-supplementation upregulated colonic PPAR gamma expression and contributed to delaying the onset of experimental IBD, whereas n-3 PUFA failed to protect from IBD, although it accelerated colonic regeneration and clinical remission by activating PPAR delta.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Both environmental and genetic factors may contribute to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Nutrition in fetal life, an early environmental factor, seems to influence the development of chronic diseases later in life, such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, and non-insulin diabetes. This population based twin study evaluated the association between intrauterine growth, measured by weight and gestational age, and IBS. Structural equation analyses were conducted to analyse genetic and environmental sources of variation in liability to IBS. METHODS: A postal questionnaire was sent to 12 700 Norwegian twins born between 1967 and 1979. The questionnaire included a checklist of 31 illnesses and symptoms, including IBS. The influence of birth weight on developing IBS was tested in four weight groups. Disease discordant monozygotic (MZ) pairs were analysed to test the association between intrauterine growth and IBS. RESULTS: Concordance for IBS was significantly greater (p = 0.011) in monozygotic (22.4%) than in dizygotic (9.1%) twins. The heritability of IBS was estimated to be 48.4% among females. Birth weight below 1500 g (adjusted odds ratio 2.4 (95% confidence interval 1.1, 5.3)) contributed significantly to the development of IBS, which appeared 7.7 years earlier than in higher weight groups. In the MZ group with birth weights lower than 2500 g, twins with IBS were significantly lighter than twins without disease (190.6 g; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that restricted fetal growth has a significant influence on the development of IBS later in life. Weight below 1500 g influences age at onset. Genetic contribution appears to be important for IBS among females.},

   abstract = {In today's climate, changed lifestyles and the increased use of antibiotics are significant factors that affect the preservation of a healthy intestinal microflora. The concept of probiotics is to restore and maintain a microflora advantageous to the human body. Probiotics are found in a number of fermented dairy products, infant formula, and dietary supplements. Basic research on probiotics has suggested several modes of action beneficial for the human body and clinical research has proven its preventive and curative features in different intestinal and extraintestinal diseases. Chronic diseases cause considerable disablement in patients and represent a substantial economic burden on healthcare resources. Research has demonstrated a crucial role of nutrition in the prevention of chronic disease. Thus, positive, strain-specific effects of probiotics have been shown in diarrheal diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, and Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis, and in atopic diseases and in the prevention of cancer. As the majority of probiotics naturally inhabit the human intestinal microflora, their use has been regarded as very safe. However, in view of the range of potential benefits on health that might be achieved by the use of some probiotic bacteria, major and thorough evaluation is still necessary. In conclusion, probiotics act as an adjuvant in the prevention and treatment of a wide variety of chronic diseases.},

   abstract = {JUSTIFICATION: Yogurt has been historically used to restore gut microflora adversely affected by antibiotic treatment. Certain fermented dairy products are probiotics; "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host." Microorganisms in foods may benefit certain health conditions such as diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. A potential new probiotic from a Polynesian traditional food is poi; a starchy paste made from the corm of taro plants. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if consumption of poi, a potential non-dairy probiotic, altered the microflora in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy adults. METHODS: A cross-over clinical study included 18 subjects (19-64 years of age) divided into a poi group (n = 10) and control group (n = 8). The study duration of 14 weeks consisted of a 2-week washout, 4-week treatment or control, a subsequent 2-week washout, cross-over of 4-week treatment or control, and a final 2-week washout. Subjects thus served as their own controls. While receiving the poi treatment, participants consumed fresh poi (1-2 days old) three times a day (130 g/meal or approximately 1/2 cup/meal); the control group did not. Both groups filled out 3-day dietary records to ensure compliance. Measurable outcomes included pre- and post-treatment microbiological fecal culture analyses. RESULTS: We found no significant differences in total bacterial counts following a poi diet versus following a control diet, nor were significant differences found in counts of specific bacterial species. Lactococcus tends to be higher in poi when it is analyzed for specific bacteria, but the poi consumption in our study did not alter the mean concentration of individual bacterial species (log10 CFU/g wet feces) for Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Bifidobacterium. No significant differences in stool frequency or consistency were observed between the treatment and control group periods. CONCLUSION: Poi consumption did not significantly alter total or individual bacterial counts in the human gastrointestinal tract. Further research might determine if "sour poi" (3-4 days old) has a greater affect than "fresh poi" (1-2 days old) as a potential probiotic, and a larger trial with longer diet durations may detect more subtle effects of poi consumption on bacterial counts.},

Yet the effects of nutrients on visceral sensitivity and symptoms in these patients have not been fully explored. AIMS: To evaluate the differences of visceral sensitivity and symptoms in healthy subjects and IBS patients during fasting and intraduodenal lipids infusion. METHODS: Graded rectal distensions at fixed tension levels were performed in 16 IBS patients (8 IBS-C and 8 IBS-D) and 6 healthy subjects before and during intraduodenal lipids infusion at 0.5 kcal/min. Tension levels were increased in 4 gr increments up to 64 gr or discomfort during both conditions. At each step, perception and symptoms were measured by means of a validated questionnaire. RESULTS: In basal conditions, perception thresholds in IBS patients and health were, respectively, 8 +/- 2 gr versus 32 +/- 9 gr (p < 0.001) with no changes during lipids. Intraduodenal lipids infusion significantly lowered threshold of discomfort in IBS patients in comparison to fasting (24 +/- 6 gr vs 34 +/- 4 gr; p < 0.05), while health tolerated all distension without discomfort. No differences of compliance, perception, or discomfort were observed between the two subgroups of patients at each tension step. The predominant symptom elicited in patients with IBS-C was abdominal pain (54%), while patients with IBS-D exhibited urgency (63%, p < 0.005); this pattern was maintained during lipids. CONCLUSIONS: Intraduodenal lipids increase visceral sensitivity in both IBS-C and IBS-D; symptoms specificity in response to rectal distension is maintained in the postprandial period. Lipids may be responsible for the postprandial symptoms exacerbation in IBS.},

   abstract = {The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) follows an acute, presumably infectious diarrheal illness in approximately 15% of patients. There may be a persistent, mild inflammatory state with changes in mucosal function or structure. Changes in the colonic bacterial flora reported in IBS seem related to predominant bowel. Colonic bacteria normally metabolize nutrients with the formation of gas and short chain fatty acids. The latter may induce propulsive contractions and accelerate colonic transit or they may enhance fluid and sodium absorption in the colon. This review addresses the mechanisms, rationale and current evidence for the efficacy of probiotics, including Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and VSL#3, in the treatment of IBS. The mechanisms influenced by probiotics include immune function, motility, and the intraluminal milieu. Probiotics may suppress the low-grade inflammation associated with IBS or restore normal local immune function. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria subspecies are able to deconjugate and absorb bile acids, potentially reducing the colonic mucosal secretion of mucin and fluids that may contribute to functional diarrhea or IBS with diarrhea. Therapeutic trials show the potential benefit of Bifidobacteria or Lactobacilli species alone or in the specific probiotic combination, VSL#3, on symptoms in IBS. Colonic transit was retarded in IBS patients treated with VSL#3 without induction of significant changes in bowel function. In summary, probiotics are promising therapies in IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To validate the pediatric Rome II criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) using the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms (QPGS). METHODS: Subjects were 315 consecutive new patients, 4 to 18 years of age, seen in a tertiary care clinic and classified by pediatric gastroenterologists as having a functional problem. Patients and parents separately completed the QPGS before medical consultation. Diagnoses were derived using computer algorithms reflecting the Rome II criteria for pediatric FGIDs. Convergent validity was assessed by prevalence of diagnoses and internal validity using factor analysis to confirm symptom clusters of the criteria. Separate analyses were performed for 4 to 9 and 10 to 18 year olds, and for diagnoses based on parent and child reports. RESULTS: In both age groups, the most prevalent diagnoses were irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (22.0%, 35.5%), functional constipation (19.0%, 15.2%), and functional dyspepsia (FD) (13.6%, 10.1%). Parent-child concordance on diagnoses was generally poor. Factor analyses supported the internal validity of FD and of IBS symptoms except for relief with defecation. Although functional abdominal pain syndrome and abdominal migraine occurred rarely, symptom clustering within each diagnosis supports their validity. Among patients with abdominal pain, duration was of at least 3 months in most, and pain was of long duration and severe in at least one third. CONCLUSION: More than half of patients classified as having a functional problem met at least one pediatric Rome II diagnosis for FGIDs. This study offers initial support for the validity of several of the criteria.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary nucleotide supplementation has been shown to have important effects on the growth and development of cells which have a rapid turnover such as those in the immune system and the gastrointestinal tract. Work with infants has shown that the incidence and duration of diarrhoea is lower when nucleotide supplementation is given, and animal work shows that villi height and crypt depth in the intestine is increased as a result of dietary nucleotides. Dietary nucleotides may be semi-essential under conditions of ill-health, poor diet or stress. Since people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome tend to fulfil these conditions, we tested the hypothesis that symptoms would be improved with dietary nucleotide supplementation. METHODS: Thirty-seven people with a diagnosis of Irritable Bowel gave daily symptom severity ratings for abdominal pain, diarrhoea, urgency to have a bowel movement, incomplete feeling of evacuation after a bowel movement, bloating, flatulence and constipation for 28 days (baseline). They were then assigned to either placebo (56 days) followed by experimental (56 days) or the reverse. There was a four week washout period before crossover. During the placebo and experimental conditions participants took one 500 mg capsule three times a day; in the experimental condition the capsule contained the nutroceutical substances. Symptom severity ratings and psychological measures (anxiety, depression, illness intrusiveness and general health) were obtained and analysed by repeated measures ANOVAs. RESULTS: Symptom severity for all symptoms (except constipation) were in the expected direction of baseline>placebo>experimental condition. Symptom improvement was in the range 4 - 6%. A feeling of incomplete evacuation and abdominal pain showed the most improvement. The differences between conditions for diarrhoea, bloating and flatulence were not significant at the p < .05 level. There were no significant differences between the conditions for any of the psychological measures. CONCLUSION: Dietary nucleotide supplementation improves some of the symptoms of irritable bowel above baseline and placebo level. As expected, placebo effects were high. Apart from abdominal pain and urgency to have a bowel movement, the improvements, while consistent, are modest, and were not accompanied by improvements in any of the psychological measures. We suggest that the percentage improvement over and above the placebo effect is a physiological effect of the nucleotide supplement on the gut. The mechanisms by which these effects might improve symptoms are discussed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In Irritable Bowel Syndrome, the gut-associated immune system may be up-regulated resulting in immune complex production, low-grade inflammation, loss of Class I bacteria, and translocation of inflammatory mediators and macromolecules outside of the GI lumen. Since food intolerance may be one of the reasons for this upregulation, our goal was to investigate the role of food intolerance in IBS patients. METHODS: In this open label pilot study, we enrolled 20 patients with IBS by Rome II criteria (15 women, ages 24-81) who had failed standard medical therapies in a tertiary care GI clinic. Baseline serum IgE and IgG food and mold panels, and comprehensive stool analysis (CSA) were performed. Breath-hydrogen testing and IBS Quality-of-Life (QOL) questionnaires were obtained. Patients underwent food elimination diets based on the results of food and mold panels followed by controlled food challenge. Probiotics were also introduced. Repeat testing was performed at 6-months. We followed up with this cohort at 1 year after trial completion to assess the reported intervention and for placebo effect. RESULTS: Baseline abnormalities were identified on serum IgG food and mold panels in 100% of the study subjects with significant improvement after food elimination and rotation diet (p < 0.05). Significant improvements were seen in stool frequency (p < 0.05), pain (p < 0.05), and IBS-QOL scores (p < 0.0001). Imbalances of beneficial flora and dysbiotic flora were identified in 100% of subjects by CSA. There was a trend to improvement of beneficial flora after treatment but no change in dysbiotic flora. The 1-year follow up demonstrated significant continued adherence to the food rotation diet (4.00 +/- 1.45), minimal symptomatic problems with IBS (4.00 +/- 1.17), and perception of control over IBS (4.15 +/- 1.23). The continued use of probiotics was considered less helpful (3.40 +/- 1.60). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that identifying and appropriately addressing food sensitivity in IBS patients not previously responding to standard therapy results in a sustained clinical response and impacts on overall well being and quality of life in this challenging entity.},

AIM: To identify the clinical features precipitating referral for colon manometry in children with functional constipation. METHOD: Retrospective medical record review of 173 constipated children (116 male, mean age 6.9 years, range 1-17 years) referred for colon manometry. RESULTS: Manometry was normal in 121 (70%). In those with normal manometry, FFR was identified in 96, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in 10, and functional constipation in 15. Of the 96 children FFR, 72 (76%) had comorbid conditions that might have interfered with the clinician's ability to diagnose FFR. Of 52 children with colon neuromuscular disease, only 12 (23%) had comorbid conditions (P < 0.001 compared with FFR). Of children more than 4 years, those with FFR were more likely to have fecal incontinence (44 of 62; 71%) than those with other functional disorders (2 of 19; 10%; P < 0.001) or neuromuscular disease (6 of 23; 26%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Two thirds of children referred for colon manometry had normal studies and met criteria for a functional diagnosis. Three quarters of those with functional constipation had a comorbid condition that might alter the history sufficiently to obscure the diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the world's most common gastrointestinal functional disorder and is associated with several social and economic costs. Health-related quality of life is often impaired in patients with IBS. The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying IBS remain poorly defined. The therapeutic approach to patients with IBS is based on symptoms, and fibers may play an important role in treatment. Among the various types of fiber, water-soluble, non-gelling fibers seem to be a promising option for treatment of IBS. Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a water-soluble, non-gelling fiber that has provided therapeutic benefits. In clinical trials, PHGG decreased symptoms in constipation-predominant and diarrhea-predominant forms of IBS and decreased abdominal pain. Further, an improvement in quality of life was observed in patients with IBS during and after treatment with PHGG. Moreover, PHGG seems to have prebiotic properties because it increases the colonic contents of short-chain fatty acids, Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacteria.},

   abstract = {Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a family of four G-protein-coupled receptors (PAR-1 to PAR-4) activated by the proteolytic cleavage of their N-terminal extracellular domain. This activation first involves the recognition of the extracellular domain by proteases, such as thrombin, but also trypsin or tryptase which are particularly abundant in the gastrointestinal tract, both under physiological circumstances and in several digestive diseases. Activation of PARs, particularly of PAR-1 and -2, modulates intestinal functions, such as gastrointestinal motility, visceral nociception, mucosal inflammatory response, and epithelial functions (intestinal secretion and permeability). As these physiological properties have been shown to be altered in various extents and combinations in different clinical presentations of irritable bowel syndrome, PARs appear as putative targets for future therapeutic intervention in these patients.},

Recent clinical trials suggest beneficial effects of certain probiotics in IBS. Because of the heterogeneity of IBS a probiotic combination may be more efficient than a single strain. We screened for optimal strains, and developed a multispecies probiotic combination consisting of L. rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, P. freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS and Bifidobacterium breve Bb99. The clinical efficacy of the probiotic combination was evaluated in IBS patients in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled six-month intervention. During six months the subjects received daily either probiotic supplementation or placebo. IBS symptoms were followed by symptom diaries. The probiotic supplementation demonstrated significant value in reducing IBS symptoms. At the end of the study period the total symptom score (abdominal pain + distension + flatulence + rumbling) had reduced with 42% in probiotic group versus 6% for instance anti-inflammatory effects, balancing of the microbiota or motility-related effects induced by the probiotic. The probiotic activity may be enhanced by synergistic effects of the combination that each strain alone would not hold. In conclusion, we found a probiotic combination of LGG and three other strains to be effective in alleviating IBS symptoms.},

Psychotherapy, which has been reported on in previous studies, is available only in specific centers. We describe in this study a novel and simple psychotherapy; that is, the fasting therapy (FT) for treatment of patients with IBS. Of 84 inpatients with IBS, 58 patients who still had moderate to severe IBS symptoms after 4-week basic treatment were investigated retrospectively. Of the 58 patients enrolled in this study, 36 underwent FT, whereas the remaining 22 received a consecutive basic treatment (control therapy). There were no significant differences in the 4-point severity scales of gastrointestinal and psychological symptoms between the 2 groups before the start of FT. The basic treatment consisted of pharmacotherapy and brief psychotherapy, whereas the FT consisted of 10 days of starvation followed by 5 days of refeeding. Changes in scores of symptoms before and after each treatment were analyzed. FT significantly improved 7 out of the 10 symptoms assessed; that is, abdominal pain-discomfort (p < .001), abdominal distension (p < .001), diarrhea (p < .001), anorexia (p = .02), nausea (p < .01), anxiety (p < .001), and interference with life in general (p < .001). However, the control therapy significantly improved only 3 out of the 10 symptoms assessed; that is, abdominal pain-discomfort (p = .03), abdominal distension (p < .01), and interference with life (p = .01). Our results suggest that FT may have beneficial effects on intractable patients with IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an increased prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms, peptic ulcer disease, and colon cancer in night-shiftworkers, whose sleep is commonly disrupted. Sleep complaints are an extrapyramidal symptom of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Sleep disruption may contribute to increased medical morbidity by weakening the ability of the immune system to protect against endotoxins-this pathway could be of potential importance to the pathogenesis and/or clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic immunoinflammatory gastrointestinal disorder associated with marked reductions in quality of life. This is the first study to comprehensively examine sleep concerns in patients with IBD. METHODS: Sixteen patients with biopsy-proven inactive IBD (8 with Crohn disease and 8 with ulcerative colitis), 9 patients with IBS, and 7 healthy controls completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, SF-12, and a single overnight polysomnogram. Polysomnography and arousals were scored according to standard criteria. Multivariate analyses were used to compare subjective and objective sleep parameters between groups and to identify associations between sleep complaints and quality of life. RESULTS: Patients with IBD did not seem to significantly differ from patients with IBS, who have established sleep complaints. On polysomnography, total sleep time differentiated the 3 groups well, with the IBS and IBD groups appearing numerically similar. Whereas IBS and IBD groups were similar with respect to observed sleep parameters, IBS patients did report the most concerns, consistent with earlier research suggesting that hyperarousal and perceptual differences may contribute to symptom reporting. CONCLUSION: Sleep parameters greatly influenced quality of life in both groups and highlight the need to address sleep concerns as part of IBD management.},

Controls were comprised of adults who underwent tonsillectomy as otherwise healthy children during the period corresponding to the FCC diagnosis. The prevalence of constipation, IBS, and dyspepsia was determined by the Bowel Disease Questionnaire. Twenty FCC adults (8 females), median age 22 years, were compared with 17 adult controls (10 females), median age 22.9 years. The frequency of constipation in FCC adults was not different from that in controls (25% versus 23.5%). The frequency of IBS in FCC adults was higher than in controls (55% versus 23.5%; P < 0.05). Dyspepsia was reported by 25% of both groups. The median follow-up period of the FCC adults was 14 years. In a long-term follow-up of a small sample, the prevalence of constipation in FCC adults is comparable to that in controls. Childhood constipation appears to be a predictor of IBS in adulthood.},

We conducted a systematic review of the published literature regarding fecal calprotectin to evaluate its potential as a noninvasive marker of neutrophilic intestinal inflammation. Reference ranges for fecal calprotectin have been established in healthy adults and children, and elevated concentrations of fecal calprotectin have been demonstrated in numerous studies of patients with IBD. Fecal calprotectin correlates well with histological inflammation as detected by colonoscopy with biopsies and has been shown successfully to predict relapses and detect pouchitis in patients with IBD. Fecal calprotectin has been shown to consistently differentiate IBD from irritable bowel syndrome because it has excellent negative predictive value in ruling out IBD in undiagnosed, symptomatic patients. Fecal calprotectin also may be useful in determining whether clinical symptoms in patients with known IBD are caused by disease flares or noninflammatory complications/underlying irritable bowel syndrome and in providing objective evidence of response to treatment. Although more studies are needed to define fully the role of fecal calprotectin, convincing studies and growing clinical experience point to an expanded role in the diagnosis and management of IBD.},

   abstract = {Rett syndrome (RS) is a neurodevelopmental syndrome of genetic origin that mainly affects females. Individuals diagnosed with RS exhibit a variety of functional difficulties that impair their quality of life. One of the affected systems is the digestive system, where 74% of persons with RS have abnormal functioning. The affected digestive system causes this population to present an array of problems, such as gastroesophageal reflux (GER), constipation, and malnutrition, leading to failure to thrive (FTT), which resolves in reduced functional ability. Due to the severe effects of the dysfunctional digestive system of individuals with RS, this article will describe the problems common to this population, as well as propose some clinical suggestions for intervention.},

   abstract = {Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a debilitating disorder characterized by chronic diffuse muscle pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression and skin sensitivity. There are no genetic or biochemical markers and patients often present with other comorbid diseases, such as migraines, interstitial cystitis and irritable bowel syndrome. Diagnosis includes the presence of 11/18 trigger points, but many patients with early symptoms might not fit this definition. Pathogenesis is still unknown, but there has been evidence of increased corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and substance P (SP) in the CSF of FMS patients, as well as increased SP, IL-6 and IL-8 in their serum. Increased numbers of activated mast cells were also noted in skin biopsies. The hypothesis is put forward that FMS is a neuro-immunoendocrine disorder where increased release of CRH and SP from neurons in specific muscle sites triggers local mast cells to release proinflammatory and neurosensitizing molecules. There is no curative treatment although low doses of tricyclic antidepressants and the serotonin-3 receptor antagonist tropisetron, are helpful. Recent nutraceutical formulations containing the natural anti-inflammatory and mast cell inhibitory flavonoid quercetin hold promise since they can be used together with other treatment modalities.},

   abstract = {Peppermint (Mentha piperita L.) is one of the most widely consumed single ingredient herbal teas, or tisanes. Peppermint tea, brewed from the plant leaves, and the essential oil of peppermint are used in traditional medicines. Evidence-based research regarding the bioactivity of this herb is reviewed. The phenolic constituents of the leaves include rosmarinic acid and several flavonoids, primarily eriocitrin, luteolin and hesperidin. The main volatile components of the essential oil are menthol and menthone. In vitro, peppermint has significant antimicrobial and antiviral activities, strong antioxidant and antitumor actions, and some antiallergenic potential. Animal model studies demonstrate a relaxation effect on gastrointestinal (GI) tissue, analgesic and anesthetic effects in the central and peripheral nervous system, immunomodulating actions and chemopreventive potential. Human studies on the GI, respiratory tract and analgesic effects of peppermint oil and its constituents have been reported. Several clinical trials examining the effects of peppermint oil on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms have been conducted. However, human studies of peppermint leaf are limited and clinical trials of peppermint tea are absent. Adverse reactions to peppermint tea have not been reported, although caution has been urged for peppermint oil therapy in patients with GI reflux, hiatal hernia or kidney stones.},

In IBS altered motility and visceral sensitivity are found throughout the whole gastrointestinal tract. We aimed to study chemospecific antroduodenal sensitivity in IBD patients. METHODS: Antroduodenal manometry was performed in 10 IBD patients in remission and 13 controls. Small volumes of nutrients and acid were administered intraduodenally. Motility variables and sensation scores were compared before and after each infusion. RESULTS: Acid and lipid infusion decreased the number of antral pressure waves in both groups (p < 0.05). After acid infusion the number of duodenal pressure waves in the sideholes just distal to the infusion port increased in IBD patients compared to the controls (p < 0.05). Lipid infusion increased the number of duodenal propagated pressure waves in both groups, but in controls they were also increased over longer distances (p < 0.005). None of the infusions significantly affected the sensation scores. CONCLUSION: Subtle alterations in chemospecific responses to lipids and acid in IBD patients in remission were observed, affecting duodenal motor activity but not duodenal perception. These changes are indicative of changes at the chemoreceptor level in the duodenal wall in this patient group.},

   abstract = {Chronic abdominal pain is a common feature of most functional gastrointestinal disorders in children, including functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). FAP can impair a child's life and often leads to significant school absences. Although the underlying mechanism is likely multifactorial, early pain experiences during a vulnerable period in the developing nervous system can cause long-term changes in the brain-gut axis and ultimately may result in altered pain pathways and visceral hyperalgesia. Care providers often feel uncomfortable managing patients with chronic abdominal pain, as the pathophysiology is poorly understood, and limited data exist regarding safety and efficacy of therapeutic options in children. The primary goal of therapy in FAP is to alleviate pain symptoms and to help the child return to normal daily activities. Treatment should be individualized and chosen based on the severity of symptoms, the existence of comorbid psychological disorders, and the impact the disorder has on the child's school attendance and normal functioning. Various psychological interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, hypnosis, and guided imagery, have been successfully used in children with chronic abdominal pain. Pharmacologic therapies such as H(2) blockers, proton-pump inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and various serotonergic drugs have been used, but good controlled trials are lacking. More studies are clearly needed to investigate the benefits and safety of pharmacologic therapy in children. Newer pharmacologic agents that target specific receptors involved in nociception, stress, and neurogenic inflammation currently are being developed. Future targets for visceral hyperalgesia should not only be aimed at alleviating symptoms but also should include prevention, particularly in cases with a suspected sensitizing event such as neonatal pain and postinfectious IBS.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: National health survey. SUBJECTS: A selection of the population (n=11,078) in Oppland county, Norway, was invited to a health screening, and a sample of subjects with IBS were included in the study. INTERVENTIONS: A medical history of food intolerance, musculoskeletal pain, mood disorders and abdominal complaints was taken, and tests were performed for food allergy and malabsorption. A dietician evaluated the dietary habits of the subjects. RESULTS: Out of 4,622 subjects with adequately filled-in questionnaires, 84 were included in the study, 59 (70%) had symptoms related to intake of food, 62% limited or excluded food items from the diet and 12% had an inadequate diet. The mean numbers of food items related to symptoms and the number of foods limited or excluded from the diet were 4.8 and 2.5, respectively. There were no associations between the tests for food allergy and malabsorption and perceived food intolerance. Perceived food intolerance was unrelated to musculoskeletal pain and mood disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived food intolerance is a common problem with significant nutritional consequences in a population with IBS. The uselessness of current antibody tests and tests for malabsorption and the lack of correlation to psychiatric co-morbidity make the etiology obscure.},

AIM: To assess the short- and long-term effects of Lactobacillus reuteri administration on clinical symptoms of IBS. METHODS: This is a double blind, placebo-controlled 6-month trial. Subjects consumed 1x10(8)cfu/tablet twice a day. The clinical severity of the IBS symptoms was evaluated by the Francis Severity score and the IBS quality-of-life score at study entry and then monthly. RESULTS: In total, 54 subjects were randomized for treatment and 39 concluded the study. Both groups (treatment and placebo) improved significantly in all the studied parameters with no significant differences between groups. Two parameters, constipation and passing gases, were marginally different between the main groups (P=0.0714 and 0.0971, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: IBS symptoms did not improve with probiotic treatment with L. reuteri. A strong placebo effect and a lack of uniformity of the IBS population may have hindered a clearer demonstration of the effect.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 700 adults from the Athens-Piraeus area selected by a 2-stage scheme based on the official maps of the Hellenic Statistic Service. Structured questionnaires were completed through personal interviews. Dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were diagnosed according to widely accepted definitions. RESULTS: Of the 700 individuals, 53% reported > or = 1 gastrointestinal symptom during the past week and 55% during the past 6 months (dyspepsia: 48%, GERD: 38%, IBS: 21%). Only one disorder was diagnosed in 25% (dyspepsia: 18%, GERD: 7%), and > or = 2 disorders in 75% of symptomatic individuals. Dyspepsia or GERD was predominant in 7% and 16% and IBS in 28% and 19% of the patients with relevant symptoms during the past week and the past 6 months, respectively (p = 0.017). Substantial symptoms during the past 6 months were reported by 60% of the symptomatic individuals. Affected daily activities were reported by 22% of symptomatic and 5% of asymptomatic individuals (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal symptoms are highly prevalent in the Greek urban general population and are substantial in the majority of symptomatic individuals. Dyspepsia and GERD are reported much more frequently than IBS symptoms, but there is a significant overlap between symptomatic diagnoses, while the predominant diagnosis may change over time. Gastrointestinal symptoms have a significant impact on patients' daily activities.},

Since CD and tropical sprue (TS) have similar intestinal functional and histological pattern of injury and that an increased inflammatory response has been reported to occur in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), liver involvement might be expected to occur either in TS or IBS. However, according to author's prior observations, the frequency of hypertransaminasemia is significantly higher in CD than in TS and IBS-diarrhea predominant patients (IBS-D). Thus, based on current knowledge, intestinal mucosal damage, increased intestinal permeability and/or an active intestinal inflammatory response do not completely explain liver damage in CD. We hypothesize that other factors, unique to CD not present in TS or IBS-D, like gluten toxicity and the presence of tissular transglutaminase (tTG) an auto-antigen with pro-inflammatory and remodeling properties, act in addition to intestinal mucosal injury and account to hypertransaminasemia in CD. Further research focusing on the mechanisms of gluten and tTG hepatic toxicity, and/or the characterization of the expression, secretion and enteral-hepatic transport of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines is needed, to understand the possible links between intestinal and liver disorders seen in CD.},

The progressive unravelling of these plant and bacterial effects on systemic immune and intestinal epithelial cell function has led to new credence for the use of probiotics and nutraceuticals in clinical medicine. Level I evidence now exists for the therapeutic use of probiotics in infectious diarrhea in children, recurrent Clostridium difficile-induced infections and post-operative pouchitis. Additional evidence is being acquired for the use of probiotics in other gastrointestinal infections, irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. Not all individual probiotic strains have the same efficacy, and future clinical trials may focus on multistrain preparations agents with known efficacy. The use of nutraceuticals and probiotics as therapeutic agents for gastrointestinal disorders is rapidly moving into clinical usage. Scientific studies are providing mechanisms of action to explain the therapeutic effects, and randomized controlled trials are providing the necessary evidence for their incorporation into the therapeutic armamentarium.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and other chronic pelvic pain (CPP) disorders often occur concomitantly. Neural cross-talk may play a role in the overlap of CPP disorders via the convergence of pelvic afferents. We investigated the hypothesis that afferent irritation of one pelvic organ may adversely influence and sensitize another via neural interactions. METHODS: We measured pelvic organ smooth muscle and striated muscle reflexes during micturition and colorectal distention (CRD) in urethane-anesthetized rats. The effects of acute cystitis on distal colonic sensory thresholds to CRD and the effects of acute colonic irritation on micturition parameters were assessed. RESULTS: External urethral sphincter (EUS) electromyography (EMG) was typical for the rat, with phasic firing during micturition. External anal sphincter EMG also showed phasic firing during micturition in synchrony with EUS activity but, in addition, showed both tonic bursts and phasic firing independent of EUS activity. Before bladder irritation, graded CRDs to 40 cm H2O produced no notable changes in abdominal wall EMG activity. Following acute bladder irritation, dramatic increases in abdominal wall EMG activity in response to CRD were observed at much lower distention pressures, indicating colonic afferent sensitization. Analogously, following acute colonic irritation, bladder contraction frequency increased 66%, suggesting sensitization of lower urinary tract afferents. CONCLUSIONS: We report compelling evidence of bidirectional cross-sensitization of the colon and lower urinary tract in a novel experimental model. This cross-sensitization may account for the substantial overlap of CPP disorders; however, further studies are needed to fully characterize these pathways.},

   abstract = {The pathophysiology of IBS is complex and still incompletely known. Both central and peripheral factors, including psychosocial factors, abnormal GI motility and secretion, and visceral hypersensitivity, are thought to contribute to the symptoms of IBS. Several studies have demonstrated altered GI motor function in IBS patients and the pattern differs between IBS subgroups based on the predominant bowel pattern. Few studies have so far addressed GI secretion in IBS, but there are some evidence supporting altered secretion in the small intestine of IBS patients. Visceral hypersensitivity is currently considered to be perhaps the most important pathophysiological factor in IBS. Importantly, several external and internal factors can modulate visceral sensitivity, as well as GI motility, and enhanced responsiveness within the GI tract to for instance stress and nutrients has been demonstrated in IBS patients. Today IBS is viewed upon as a disorder of dysregulation of the so-called brain-gut axis, involving abnormal function in the enteric, autonomic and/or central nervous systems, with peripheral alterations probably dominating in some patients and disturbed central processing of signals from the periphery in others.},

   abstract = {Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is characterized by nutrient malabsorption, associated with an excessive number of bacteria in the proximal small intestine. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth presents several difficulties and limitations, and as yet there is not a widespread agreement on the best diagnostic test. SIBO occurs when there are alterations in intestinal anatomy, gastrointestinal motility, or a lack of gastric acid secretion. The true association between SIBO and irritable bowel syndrome and celiac disease remains uncertain. The treatment usually consists in the eradication of bacterial overgrowth with repeated courses of antimicrobials, nutritional support and when it is possible, the correction of underlying predisposing conditions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the clinical features at presentation as well as the associated disorders, family history, and evaluation of compliance with a gluten-free diet in children with celiac disease from across Canada. STUDY DESIGN: All members (n = 5240) of the Canadian Celiac Association were surveyed with a questionnaire. Of the 2849 respondents with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease, 168 who were < 16 years old provided the data reported here. RESULTS: The mean age when surveyed was 9.1 +/- 4.1 years, and 58% were female. Median age at diagnosis was 3.0 years with a range of 1 to 15 years. Presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (90%), weight loss (71%), diarrhea (65%), weakness (64%), nausea/vomiting (53%), anemia (40%), mood swings (37%), and constipation (30%). Almost one third of families consulted > or = 2 pediatricians before confirmation of the diagnosis. Before the recognition of celiac disease, other diagnoses received by these children included anemia (15%), irritable bowel syndrome (11%), gastroesophageal reflux (8%), stress (8%), and peptic ulcer disease (4%). A serological test was performed to screen for celiac disease in 70% of those in this population. Eight percent had either type 1 diabetes mellitus or a first-degree relative with celiac disease. Almost all respondents (95%) reported strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, and 89% noted improved health. Reactions after accidental gluten ingestion developed in 54% of the children between 0.5 and 60 hours after ingestion with a median of 2.0 hours. Reactions included abdominal discomfort (87%), diarrhea (64%), bloating (57%), fatigue (37%), headache (24%), and constipation (8%), and most displayed > 1 symptom. Although most adjusted well to their disease and diet, 10% to 20% reported major disruptions in lifestyle. Twenty-three percent felt angry all or most of the time about following a gluten-free diet. Only 15% avoided traveling all or most of the time, and during travel, 83% brought gluten-free food with them all of the time. More than half of the families avoided restaurants all or most of the time. Twenty-eight percent of the respondents found it extremely difficult to locate stores with gluten-free foods, and 27% reported extreme difficulty in finding gluten-free foods or determining if foods were free of gluten. Sixty-three percent of the respondents felt that the information supplied by the Canadian Celiac Association was excellent. Gastroenterologists provided excellent information to 44%, dietitians to 36%, and the family physician to 11.5%. When asked to select 2 items that would improve their quality of life, better labeling of gluten-containing ingredients was selected by 63%, more gluten-free foods in the supermarket by 49%, gluten-free choices on restaurant menus by 49%, earlier diagnosis of celiac disease by 34%, and better dietary counseling by 7%. CONCLUSIONS: In Canada, children with celiac disease present at all ages with a variety of symptoms and associated conditions. Delays in diagnosis are common. Most children are compliant with a gluten-free diet. A minority of these children experience difficulties in modifying their lifestyles, and gluten-free foods remain difficult to obtain.},

   abstract = {The Rome II pediatric criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) were defined in 1999 to be used as diagnostic tools and to advance empirical research. In this document, the Rome III Committee aimed to update and revise the pediatric criteria. The decision-making process to define Rome III criteria for children aged 4-18 years consisted of arriving at a consensus based on clinical experience and review of the literature. Whenever possible, changes in the criteria were evidence based. Otherwise, clinical experience was used when deemed necessary. Few publications addressing Rome II criteria were available to guide the committee. The clinical entities addressed include (1) cyclic vomiting syndrome, rumination, and aerophagia; 2) abdominal pain-related FGIDs including functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, abdominal migraine, and functional abdominal pain; and (3) functional constipation and non-retentive fecal incontinence. Adolescent rumination and functional constipation are newly defined for this age group, and the previously designated functional fecal retention is now included in functional constipation. Other notable changes from Rome II to Rome III criteria include the decrease from 3 to 2 months in required symptom duration for noncyclic disorders and the modification of the criteria for functional abdominal pain. The Rome III child and adolescent criteria represent an evolution from Rome II and should prove useful for both clinicians and researchers dealing with childhood FGIDs. The future availability of additional evidence-based data will likely continue to modify pediatric criteria for FGIDs.},

   abstract = {Constipation is a common gastrointestinal symptom and affects about 20% of the general population. This symptom can reflect a vast array of problems, from inadequate fiber intake to colonic dismotility function. Identifying chronic constipation subtypes on underlying physiology guides the therapeutic choices. Chronic constipation subtypes includes: slow-transit constipation, functional constipation, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation predominance and pelvic floor dysfunction. The most useful tests for the evaluation of those patients are the colonic transit time with radiopaque markers and anorrectal manometry with balloon expulsion test. Patients with both normal tests have either functional constipation or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. Subjects with a delayed colonic transit and normal anorectal manometry maybe classified as colonic inertia. Pelvic floor dysfunction maybe suspected if the patient had an abnormal manometry with failure to expulse de balloon. Initial treatments of chronic constipation are dietary fiber and medicinal bulk. Subsequent treatments if fiber is not successful or tolerated would include saline osmotic laxatives such as lactulose and polyethylene glycol, or stimulants like senna or bisacodyl. For patients with pelvic floor dyssynergia biofeedback therapy is the first therapeutic option. In this article we present an overview of current diagnostic tools for patients with chronic constipation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine psychosocial differences in diagnostic subgroups of children with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP). METHODS: Children meeting Apley's 1975 definition of RAP were divided according to physician ratings into three subgroups, based on the Rome II diagnostic criteria of functional gastrointestinal disorders: functional dyspepsia (n=17), irritable bowel syndrome (n=18), and functional abdominal pain (n=27). Groups were compared using measures of (a) child psychopathology, (b) parent psychopathology, and (c) child pain, somatization, and functional disability. RESULTS: Multivariate results from a discriminant function analysis demonstrated that children classified according to these criteria could not be differentiated with respect to parent reported child psychopathology or child pain, somatization, and functional disability. There were significant univariate differences, however, between groups on parental psychopathology (F=4.39, P=0.02); parents of children with functional dyspepsia reported greater parental psychopathology symptoms than the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a preliminary comparison of pain, somatization, functional impact, and psychopathology ratings in the Rome II diagnostic subclassifications of children with RAP. Further investigation utilizing larger sample sizes, pain measures specifying pain location, and parental modeling of somatic behavior is indicated to better understand potential similarities and differences between these subgroups.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet has been implicated to play a role in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in clinic-based studies. No population-based data comparing food and nutrient consumption between individuals with FGID and without gastrointestinal symptoms are available. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the dietary consumption of specific food items and nutrients between individuals with FGID and without symptoms in a population-based sample. METHODS: A validated self-report Bowel Disease Questionnaire was mailed to an age- and gender-stratified random sample of participants aged 20-50 yr from Olmsted County, Minnesota. All patients who reported either FGID symptoms (irritable bowel or dyspepsia) or no gastrointestinal symptoms were invited to undergo a blinded physician interview and physical exam and to complete a validated Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In total, 222 of the 260 eligible (85%) subjects participated and 218 provided diet data: 99 were FGID cases and 119 were healthy controls. Cases and controls consumed similar number of servings per week of wheat-containing foods, lactose-containing foods, caffeinated drinks, and fructose-sweetened beverages. Cases were slightly more likely to consume >or=7 servings per week of norepinephrine- and epinephrine-containing foods (57%vs 45%, p= 0.10), but not serotonin- or tryptophan-containing foods. No differences were observed for amount of intake of calories, fiber, protein, iron, calcium, niacin, and vitamins C, D, E, niacin, B(1), B(2), B(6), and B(12). Cases reported consuming more fat (median, 33%vs 31%) and less carbohydrates (median, 49%vs 52%) than controls. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were seen in the consumption of frequently suspected "culprit" foods between community residents with and without FGID symptoms. While symptoms may be due to food sensitivity rather than altered diet composition, the role of fat and perhaps norepinephrine and epinephrine in foods in gut symptoms needs to be studied further.},

As the major part of the microbiota has not yet been cultured, molecular methods are required to determine microbial composition and the impact of specific dietary components including probiotics. Probiotics are viable microbial food supplements, which have a beneficial impact on human health. Health-promoting properties have been demonstrated for specific probiotic products. The most significant demonstrations for probiotic efficacy include prevention and treatment of antibiotic associated diarrhea, rotavirus diarrhea and allergy prevention. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (=ATCC 53103) and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 are the among the best-characterized and most studied probiotic strains with demonstrated impact on human health. New complex targets for probiotics include irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori infection. For future probiotics the most important target is a demonstrated clinical benefit supported by knowledge on the mechanistic actions in the microbiota of the target population. Molecular and genomics-based knowledge of the composition and functions of the microbiota, as well as deviations from the balanced microbiota, will advance the selection of new and specific probiotics. Potential combinations of specific probiotics may prove to be the next step to reduce the risk on intestinal diseases and reconstruct specific microbial deviations.},

As a result, the efficacy of one strain or species cannot necessarily be inferred from another. The objective of this review is to examine the current scientific literature that could be used as the basis for potential health claims. More specifically, this paper will review existing evidence of different probiotic strains to prevent and treat diarrhea, treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), treat inflammatory bowel disease, and prevent colon cancer. The strongest evidence is related to the use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in the prevention and treatment of rotavirus-associated diarrhea. Further examination of the literature also shows promise in the treatment of some forms of IBS with probiotics. Future studies that use consistent supplementation regimes will allow more definitive conclusions to be drawn on the effects of probiotics on IBS, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer.},

Rates of diagnostic agreement and reasons for disagreement were examined to determine whether changes to the Rome II criteria are needed to improve diagnostic classification. METHODS: One hundred and forty-eight children and their parents or guardians completed the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms during their first visit to a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Parent- and child-report Rome II diagnoses were based on Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms scoring criteria, whereas the physician's Rome II diagnosis was based on clinical impression from history and physical examination completed at this visit. Statistical comparisons involved Pearson chi tests and Fisher exact tests. Kappa and weighted kappa measured agreement rates. RESULTS: Most children met the criteria for a functional gastrointestinal disorder based on the Rome II criteria. Functional dyspepsia was the most common diagnosis made by all three sources. The percentage of children classified as "no diagnosis" was small and was often a function of symptom duration (especially when diagnosis rested on the child self-report). Diagnostic agreement was fair to moderate. Diagnoses based on parent and child questionnaires agreed more often on functional dyspepsia than irritable bowel syndrome. Diagnostic disagreement was most likely to result from parent and child disagreement on defecation symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The Rome II classification system shows promise for improving diagnosis, study and treatment of children with recurrent abdominal pain. However, further refinement and clarification of the Rome II criteria for symptom duration and frequency may be needed to improve diagnostic agreement.},

The objective was to retrospectively evaluate a potentially successful diet therapy in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and fructose malabsorption. Tables detailing the content of fructose and fructans in foods were constructed. A dietary strategy comprising avoidance of foods containing substantial free fructose and short-chain fructans, limitation of the total dietary fructose load, encouragement of foods in which glucose was balanced with fructose, and co-ingestion of free glucose to balance excess free fructose was devised. Sixty-two consecutively referred patients with irritable bowel syndrome and fructose malabsorption on breath hydrogen testing underwent dietary instruction. Dietary adherence and effect on abdominal symptoms were evaluated via telephone interview 2 to 40 months (median 14 months) later. Response to the diet was defined as improvement of all symptoms by at least 5 points on a -10- to 10-point scale. Forty-eight patients (77%) adhered to the diet always or frequently. Forty-six (74%) of all patients responded positively in all abdominal symptoms. Positive response overall was significantly better in those adherent than nonadherent (85% vs 36%; P<0.01), as was improvement in individual symptoms (P<0.01 for all symptoms). This comprehensive fructose malabsorption dietary therapy achieves a high level of sustained adherence and good symptomatic response.},

   abstract = {The use of probiotics, once discussed primarily in the context of alternative medicine, is now entering mainstream medicine. However, only a few of the potential health benefits attributed to probiotics have been confirmed in well-designed, well-conducted, randomized, controlled trials. This is especially true in the pediatric population. We review here the available evidence on efficacy of probiotics in children in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. Although we restrict our analysis to the pediatric age, whenever potentially relevant information is available only from adult studies, they are examined as well. Probiotics have been most extensively studied in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, where their efficacy can be considered well established. Studies documenting effects in other childhood gastrointestinal illnesses are few, although some preliminary results are promising. Furthermore, only a limited number of probiotic strains have been tested, and, as the effects of different probiotic microorganisms are not equivalent, results cannot be generalized. Thus, at present, we have some positive certainties, lots of exciting promises and many unanswered questions.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome and interstitial cystitis frequently overlap. We have shown that acute colitis sensitizes urinary bladder afferents to both mechanical and chemical stimuli and that chronic colitis similarly produces neurogenic cystitis. We hypothesize that chronic irritation of the colon releases neuropeptides from bladder afferents, leading to receptor sensitization and neurogenic inflammation. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received intrarectal trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) or vehicle 3 days following either systemic capsaicin (CP) pretreatment or vehicle. Ten days later, action potentials of single-unit pelvic C-fiber afferents with receptive fields in the bladder were recorded under urethane anesthesia during graded bladder distensions (UBD) or intravesical capsaicin (vCP) administration. In controls, UBD increased bladder afferent firing in proportion to intravesical pressure. At intravesical pressures of 30 mmHg and above, the percent increase in afferent firing was significantly accentuated following TNBS compared with controls (1,222 +/- 176 vs. 624 +/- 54%, P < 0.01). The response to vCP was also enhanced (4,126 +/- 775 vs. 1,979 +/- 438%, P < 0.01). Systemic depletion of neuropeptides from sensory nerves abolished these effects. Histological examination of the bladders revealed an increase in mast cell density in TNBS-treated animals compared with controls (18.02 +/- 1.25 vs. 3.11 +/- 0.27 mast cells/x100 field, P < 0.01). This effect was significantly ameliorated with CP (10.25 +/- 0.95, P < 0.5 vs. TNBS-treated animals). In summary, chronic colonic irritation in the rat sensitizes urinary bladder afferents to noxious stimuli and causes mast cell infiltration in the bladder. Depletion of neuropeptides from sensory afferents diminishes these effects, suggesting they play an important role.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A disturbance in microbial balance of the gastrointestinal tract is often associated with diarrhea. Therefore, probiotics, as beneficial microorganisms for host health, have attracted clinical attention for their potential therapeutic application in the treatment of diarrhea. This review focuses on new research findings relevant to the effects of probiotics on diarrhea prevention and treatment and potential mechanisms of action for this alternative therapy for diarrhea. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical trials suggest potential beneficial effects of probiotic therapy for preventing and treating antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute diarrhea including rotavirus-induced diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. The most extensively studied probiotics for diarrhea are Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Saccharomyces, with potential mechanisms of therapeutic action based on the protection of intestinal epithelial cell and barrier function, prevention of enterotoxin binding to intestinal epithelial cells, and regulation of intestinal microbial environment. SUMMARY: Growing evidence suggests that probiotics may serve as a functional food in the treatment of diarrhea. Remaining challenges include identifying mechanisms of action to provide the basis of more refined hypothesis-driven clinical trials. The correct combination and concentration of probiotics applied to the appropriate gastrointestinal disorders may improve the efficacy of this approach for diarrhea and other diseases.},
