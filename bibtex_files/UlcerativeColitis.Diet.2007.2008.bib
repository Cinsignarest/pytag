   abstract = {Alkaline sphingomyelinase (Alk-SMase) is a key enzyme in the intestinal tract for digestion of dietary sphingomyelin (SM), which generates lipid messengers with cell-cycle regulating effects. The enzyme is significantly decreased in ulcerative colitis and colon cancer. Based on this information, we wanted to investigate whether the enzyme had preventive effects against murine colitis. We report herein a method to express a biologically active Alk-SMase from Pichia pastoris yeast cells. By using the expressed enzyme to treat a rat colitis model induced by dextran sulfate sodium, we found that intrarectal instillation of Alk-SMase once daily for 1 week significantly reduced the inflammation score and protected the colonic epithelium from inflammatory destruction. We found a tendency for decreased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha expression in the Alk-SMase-treated group. This study, for the first time, provides a method to produce the enzyme and shows the potential applicability of the enzyme in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are characterized by ongoing mucosal inflammation in which dysfunction of the host immunologic response against dietary factors and commensal bacteria is involved. The chronic inflammatory process leads to disruption of the epithelial barrier, and the formation of epithelial ulceration. This permits easy access for the luminal microbiota and dietary antigens to cells resident in the lamina propria, and stimulates further pathological immune cell responses. Cytokines are essential mediators of the interactions between activated immune cells and non-immune cells, including epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The clinical efficacy of targeting TNF-alpha clearly indicates that cytokines are the therapeutic targets in IBD patients. In this manuscript, we focus on the biological activities of recently-reported cytokines [Interleukin (IL)-17 cytokine family, IL-31 and IL-32], which might play a role through interaction with TNF-alpha in the pathophysiology of IBD.},

The interaction between intestinal environmental factors of food and intestinal microbes and the immunological system of hosts seems to be an important aspect. We have reviewed the relationship of the daily consumption of dietary animal meat and fats, dairy products, sugar, and other factors that may be linked to the occurrence of CD and UC from the literature and Japanese epidemiological data. In the present study, we reviewed the association between food and intestinal microbes and other factors contributing to the occurence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from epidemiological data and case-control studies of IBD in the literature that appeared on Medline, and assessed the reports of intestinal microbes involved in the occurrence of IBD. We found several papers describing the positive association of animal meat and sweets and sugar with the occurrence of CD and UC. An analysis of Japanese epidemiological data suggested that the registered number of patients with CD or UC started to increase more than 20 years after an increased daily consumption of dietary animal meat and fats, and milk and dairy products, and after a decreased consumption of rice. Many studies implied a positive role of intestinal microbes in the occurrence of IBD. Intestinal environmental factors, such as Westernized food and intestinal microbes, seem to be involved in the increased occurrence of IBD.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of a new oral preparation, highly concentrated in fish cartilage, in a group of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients with chronic iron deficient anemia. METHODS: In an open label pilot study, we supple-mented a group of 25 patients (11 with Crohn's disease and 14 with ulcerative colitis) in stable clinical conditions and chronic anemia with a food supplement which does not contain iron but contains a standardized fraction of fish cartilage glycosaminoglycans and a mixture of antioxidants (Captafer Medestea, Turin, Italy). Patients received 500 mg, twice a day during meals, for at least 4 mo. Patients were suggested to maintain their alimentary habit. At time 0 and after 2 and 4 mo, emocrome, sideremia and ferritin were examined. Paired data were analyzed with Student's t test. RESULTS: Three patients relapsed during the study (2 in the 3rd mo, 1 in the 4th mo), two patients were lost to follow up and two patients dropped out (1 for orticaria, 1 for gastric burning). Of the remaining 18 patients, levels of serum iron started to rapidly increase within the 2nd mo of treatment, P < 0.05), whereas serum ferritin and hemoglobin needed a longer period to significantly improve their serum levels (mo 4) P < 0.05. The product was safe, easy to administer and well tolerated by patients. CONCLUSION: These data suggest a potential new treatment for IBD patients with iron deficiency chronic anemia and warrant further larger controlled studies.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was designed to compare short-term outcomes after laparoscopic ileal pouch-anal anastomosis with those of open ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in patients with both sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Sixteen patients with sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis undergoing laparoscopic ileal pouch-anal anastomosis were matched with 16 open ileal pouch control subjects by sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists' score, age, and body mass index. RESULTS: Operative mortality was zero. Operative time was longer in the laparoscopic group (500 +/- 125.8 vs. 381.8 +/- 60.9 minutes, P = 0.03). Thirty-day complications were not significantly different between groups (laparoscopic 25 percent vs. open 43.7 percent, P = 0.26). Length of stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (5.3 +/- 1.3 days vs. 9.9 +/- 3.3 days open, P < 0.001). Average return of gastrointestinal function was 2.5 days in the laparoscopic group and 4.8 days in the open group (P = 0.001). Time to soft diet was three days in the laparoscopic group and six days in the open group (P < 0.001). All patients were alive and all pouches were intact at last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is feasible with apparent safety in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, resulting in shorter duration of hospital stay and quicker return of gastrointestinal function compared with the open procedure with no difference in perioperative complications, reoperations, and readmissions.},

TGFbeta1 dysregulation has been observed in several chronic human diseases, including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and colon carcinoma. In the first two conditions, a marked oxidative stress is consistently present, while in the third one, levels of reactive oxygen species tend to be significantly lower than in the surrounding normal tissue. Lipid-derived compounds such as the aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) or cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols) were shown able to induce expression and synthesis of TGFbeta1, an event which can be detrimental or beneficial, essentially depending on its actual intensity. Understanding how specific dietary lipids may influence the complex molecular signaling underlying this cytokine expression, may provide new indications for therapeutic and preventive strategies in inflammatory bowel diseases and colon carcinoma.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Curcumin (diferulolylmethane) has been shown to have a protective role in mouse models of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and to reduce the relapse rate in human ulcerative colitis (UC), thus making it a potentially viable supportive treatment option. Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis in NKT-deficient SJL/J mice has been described as Th1-mediated inflammation, whereas BALB/c mice are believed to exhibit a mixed Th1/Th2 response. METHODS: We therefore investigated the effect of dietary curcumin in colitis induced in these 2 strains. RESULTS: In the BALB/c mice, curcumin significantly increased survival, prevented weight loss, and normalized disease activity. In the SJL/J mice, curcumin demonstrated no protective effects. Genomewide microarray analysis of colonic gene expression was employed to define the differential effect of curcumin in these 2 strains. This analysis not only confirmed the disparate responses of the 2 strains to curcumin but also indicated different responses to TNBS. Curcumin inhibited proliferation of splenocytes from naive BALB/c mice but not SJL/J mice when nonspecifically stimulated in vitro with concanavalin A (ConA). Proliferation of CD4(+) splenocytes was inhibited in both strains, albeit with about a 2-fold higher IC(50) in SJL/J mice. Secretion of IL-4 and IL-5 by CD4(+) lymphocytes of BALB/c mice but not SJL/J mice was significantly augmented by ConA and reduced to control levels by curcumin. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of dietary curcumin in TNBS colitis varies in BALB/c and SJL/J mouse strains. Although the exact mechanism underlying these differences is unclear, the results suggest that the therapeutic value of dietary curcumin may differ depending on the nature of immune dysregulation in IBD.},

Seal and fish oils are rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and possibly therefore high doses of nasoduodenally administered seal oil rapidly relieved inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated joint pain in two recent studies. In the present study, we compared the effects of short-term oral administration of seal oil and cod liver oil on IBD-related joint pain, leucotriene B(4) level, serum fatty acid profile and IBD activity. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 21 had Crohn's disease and 17 ulcerative colitis. Ten milliters of seal oil (n=18) or cod liver oil (n=20) was self-administered orally 3 times a day for 14 days before meals in a double-blind setting. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two intervention groups or between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. There was a tendency toward improvement in several joint pain parameters after both seal oil and cod liver oil administration. Further, plasma leucotriene B(4) concentration, serum Sigma n-6 to Sigma n-3, and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) to eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) ratios were similarly reduced after administration of seal oil and cod liver oil. CONCLUSION: No significant differences in the two treatment groups were seen; in both groups, the changes in several joint pain parameters, leucotriene B(4) level of plasma, and serum fatty acid profile were putatively favourable.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncommon in children younger than 2 years of age. The criteria for differentiating IBD from other diseases with similar clinical presentation is unclear. We describe 16 patients who, between 1984 and 2004, received a histological diagnosis of IBD during the first two years of life. Six patients presented with histological Crohn's disease, eight with ulcerative colitis and two with indeterminate colitis. The median age at diagnosis was 125 days (range 1 day to 18 months) and the medium follow up was 89 months (range 65 days to 20 years). The disease appeared to be very severe: four children (25%) underwent total parenteral nutrition (TPN), two received colectomy (12.5%) and three patients died. Many of the patients required an aggressive, multidrug, immunosuppressive approach (azathioprine [AZA], Infliximab, thalidomide, cyclosporine A). One child presented with a hypogammaglobulinaemia without any specific immunodeficiency, while in the other patients, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (4 cases) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (2 cases) were identified. In 6/16 cases, allergic colitis was first considered; these cases initially underwent cow's milk protein-free diet as the only therapy before IBD was finally diagnosed. In conclusion, early IBD has a severe prognosis and often needs an aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, an improper diagnosis of allergic colitis might cause an important diagnostic delay. Some severe immunodeficiencies, such as WAS and CGD, may represent a problem in terms of differential diagnosis and might be wrongly diagnosed as very early onset IBD.},

OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of oligofructose-enriched inulin in patients with active ulcerative colitis. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, placebo controlled pilot trial. Eligible patients had been previously in remission with mesalazine as maintenance therapy or no drug, and presented with a relapse of mild to moderate activity. They were treated with mesalazine (3 g/day) and randomly allocated to receive either oligofructose-enriched inulin (12 g/day, p.o., n = 10) or placebo (12 g/day of maltodextrin, p.o., n = 9) for 2 week. Primary endpoint was the anti-inflammatory effect as determined by reduction of calprotectin and human DNA in faeces. RESULTS: Rachmilewitz score decreased in both groups, reaching statistical significance at day 14 (P < 0.05). Oligofructose-enriched inulin was well-tolerated and dyspeptic symptoms scale decreased significantly with active treatment but not with placebo. At day 7, an early significant reduction of calprotectin was observed in the group receiving oligofructose-enriched inulin (day 0: 4377 +/- 659 microg/g; day 7: 1033 +/- 393 microg/g, P < 0.05) but not in the placebo group (day 0: 5834 +/- 1563 microg/g; day 7: 4084 +/- 1395 microg/g, n.s.). Changes in faecal concentration of human DNA were not significant. CONCLUSION: In active ulcerative colitis, dietary supplementation with oligofructose-enriched inulin is well tolerated and is associated with early reduction in faecal calprotectin.},

   abstract = {In order to increase dietary folic acid intake and to improve nutritional status regarding folate by controlling homocysteine concentrations, ten patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease in the colon and ulcerative colitis) received individualized nutritional guidance and were followed up as outpatients for 2 months. The following procedures were performed at the beginning of the study (T0), after 1 month (T1) and at the end of the study (T2): collection of anthropometric data (weight and height), dietary data (24 h diet recall), and blood under fasting condition for the determination of serum folic acid, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and vitamin B12. Plasma folic acid deficiency was not detected but hyperhomocysteinemia was present in six individuals and C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased (>0.5 mg/dl) in seven patients. After the patients were instructed there was a significant increase in vitamin B6 intake (about 35%) and in folate intake (49.6%). Mean plasma levels of folic acid, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 did not change, but there was a significant decrease of CRP at T1, 0.36 mg dl(-1) on average (P = 0.01), which was maintained at T2. We conclude that the increased folate intake reported by this group of patients was not reflected in improved serum concentrations of folic acid and homocysteine. However, the guidelines for the patients probably induced them to choose a more adequate diet, providing nutrients that help control the inflammatory process.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Since folate is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, we hypothesized that folic acid antagonists might increase the risk. We used data from a population-based case control study of medication use and colorectal cancer to evaluate the hypothesis. METHODS: Case patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum were ascertained from participating hospitals in Massachusetts and the Massachusetts cancer registry (MCR) from January 1, 2001, through November 30, 2004. Age-, sex-, and precinct-matched control subjects were chosen from Massachusetts town lists. Information on folic acid antagonist use and other relevant data were obtained from 1809 cases and 1809 matched controls by telephone interview and by a self-administered dietary questionnaire. We used logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios among 1229 case patients and 1165 control subjects who provided satisfactory dietary information and did not have Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. RESULTS: The odds ratio for colorectal cancer among regular users of folate-containing supplements was 0.7 (95%CI 0.6-0.9). The odds ratio for regular use of folic acid antagonists was 1.3 (95%CI 0.9-1.9). Contrary to expectation, the odds ratio was reduced in the highest category of alcohol consumption (OR = 0.5, 95%CI 0.2-1.2). The odds ratio was higher among users of drugs that inhibit dihydrofolate reductase (OR = 1.6, 95%CI 0.9-2.8) than drugs that work through other mechanisms (OR = 1.2, 95%CI 0.7-1.9). CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide little support for the hypothesis that regular folic acid antagonist use increases the risk of colorectal cancer. However, there is a suggestion that dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors specifically may increase the risk.},

   abstract = {Colorectal cancer is a major cause of mortality and treatment costs are considerable. Advocating lifestyle modification, faecal occult blood testing and surveillance colonoscopy in appropriate populations are already in practice. A developing concept is chemoprevention. Several models of carcinogenesis in colorectal cancer have been developed and there is an increasing database on the major molecular mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis mainly from preclinical experiments and phase I trials. There have been several large epidemiological and observational studies to evaluate possible protective effects of >200 agents. More recently, case-control and cohort studies and well-conceived, phase II/III clinical trials have been done or are under way to evaluate putative chemopreventive agents including established drugs like aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 5-aminosalicylates and statins; more controversial drugs like cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, ursodeoxycholic acid; various vitamins and micronutrients including calcium, selenium, folic acid, and dietary fibre, fat and protein content. Despite promising outcome in preclinical studies, there is currently very limited data from well-controlled and appropriately powered clinical studies. The most promising agents currently are aspirin, traditional NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. The recent reports of cardiovascular risks of the COX-2 inhibitors and some traditional NSAIDs have resulted in stagnation of the field. Pending the expected release of results from several phase III trials in the near future, chemoprevention for colorectal cancer can only be practically considered in the very-high-risk population like those with familial adenomatous polyposis and ulcerative colitis, in conjunction with surveillance colonoscopy. This article reviews the major models of colorectal carcinogenesis, the concept of chemoprevention with special reference to colorectal cancer and the current state of clinical literature and the future direction of colorectal cancer chemoprevention for both researcher and clinician alike.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a form of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that almost always affects the rectal mucosa and variable length of the colon in continuity and at times mucosa of the entire colon. It is not caused by any specific pathogen. Genetics, environmental factors and altered immune responses to dietary macromolecules, colonic bacteria and cellular proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of UC. Autoimmune response against cytoskeletal, microfilament protein tropomyosin (Tm) seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of UC. The predominant colonic epithelial Tm isoform, hTm5, can induce both humoral (B-cells) and cellular (T-cells) response in patients with UC. Such responses are not seen in normal subjects and disease control subjects, such as patients with Crohn's disease (CD, another type of IBD) and patients with lupus. A novel observation that hTm5 is expressed on colon epithelial cell surface but not on small intestinal epithelial cells provides evidence for presentation to immune effector cells. This surface expression of hTm5 seems to be facilitated by a colon epithelial cell membrane associated protein, CEP, that acts as a chaperone for the trans-migration of hTm5 to the surface and both hTm5 and CEP are then released outside the cell. Both CEP and hTm5 expression are increased with pro-inflammatory cytokine, such as gamma-interferon. hTm5 expression in UC mucosa is also significantly increased compared to normal. Finally, autoantibodies against hTm5 observed both in circulation and in the colon mucosa of patients with UC are pathogenic causing colon epithelial cell destruction by antibody and complement mediated cytolysis.},

There were no positive findings, except for diverticulosis. Almost 5 years later repeat investigations performed in response to the patient's anemia confirmed the development of celiac disease. After 18 months of symptom improvement as a result of gluten exclusion the patient developed diarrhea, and colonoscopy revealed ulcerative colitis. INVESTIGATIONS: Physical examination; analysis of full blood count; measurement of serum ferritin, vitamin B(12), folate and C-reactive protein levels; thyroid and autoantibody profiling (including analysis of endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies); CT scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis; and performance of esophagogastroduodenoscopy, push enteroscopy, colonoscopy and wireless capsule endoscopy. DIAGNOSIS: Celiac disease and ulcerative colitis. MANAGEMENT: Gluten-free diet, mesalazine and prednisolone.},

The long-term nutritional consequences after pouch surgery are unknown. We have assessed the nutritional status of the essential trace elements-zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium-in patients several years (median, 10 (range, 2-15) years) after surgery. METHODS: Fifty-five patients with uncomplicated ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and 46 healthy control subjects were studied. A dietary assessment of trace element intake was undertaken by using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. The patients' trace elements status for zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium was assessed by measuring their concentrations in blood. RESULTS: The dietary intake of individual trace elements was similar in both groups (all P values > 0.4). There was no significant difference in the concentrations of plasma copper, zinc, and selenium between patients and healthy control subjects (all P values > 0.07). The concentration of whole blood manganese was significantly higher (P = 0.004) in patients (median, 178.5 nmol/l; range, 59-478 nmol/l) compared with healthy control subjects (median, 140 nmol/l; range, 53-267 nmol/l). Four (7 percent) patients had manganese concentrations more than three standard deviations of the mean of control group (>255 nmol/l). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that patients who have had uncomplicated pouch surgery have a normal dietary intake of trace elements and do not develop deficiencies in copper, zinc, manganese, and selenium. However, these patients may be at increased risk of manganese toxicity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the operation of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis. Free radical activity and the status of lipid soluble antioxidant vitamins have not been previously assessed in patients with IPAA. The aim of the present study was to measure the plasma concentrations of lipophyllic antioxidants and free radical activity in IPAA patients and compare them with normal subjects. METHOD: Forty-eight IPAA patients and 50 healthy controls were studied. A dietary assessment of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and carotene was undertaken and plasma antioxidant status was assessed. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured to assess the extent of free radical damage. In IPAA patients, association between the degree of inflammation in the pouch mucosa and the plasma concentration of lipophyllic antioxidants and extent of free radical activity was investigated. RESULTS: The dietary intake of carotene was similar in both groups. Intake of vitamin E was significantly lower in patients than controls (P = 0.01). In the IPAA group plasma concentrations of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene were significantly lower (P < 0.001) and alpha-tocopherol:cholesterol ratio significantly higher (P < 0.001). Free radical damage was significantly greater in patients than controls (P < 0.01). There were no significant correlations between the degree of inflammation in the pouch and plasma concentrations of MDA, carotenoids, alpha-tocopherol:cholesterol ratio or intake of vitamins. CONCLUSION: Compared with normal subjects, patients with IPAA have significantly lower plasma concentrations of lipophyllic antioxidants alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene and higher free radical activity suggesting increased oxidative stress. These differences do not appear to be related to diet and do not correlate with histological severity of pouch inflammation.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Long-term results after laparoscopic ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) have not been thoroughly evaluated. Our study prospectively compares short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic and open IPAA. METHODS: Between October 2002 and November 2007, 73 laparoscopic and 106 open IPAA patients were enrolled. Patient- and disease-specific characteristics and short- and long-term outcomes were prospectively collected. RESULTS: There were no differences in demographics, treatment, indication, duration of surgery, and diversion between groups. Laparoscopic patients had faster return of flatus (p = 0.008), faster assumption of a liquid diet (p < 0.001), and less blood loss (p = 0.026). While complications were similar, the incidence of incisional hernias was lower in the laparoscopic group (p = 0.011). Mean follow-up was 24.8 months. Average number of bowel movements was 6.8 +/- 2.8/day for laparoscopy and 6.3 +/- 1.7 for open (p = 0.058). Overall, 68.4% of patients were fully continent at 1 year, up to 83.7% long term without differences between groups. Other indicators of defecatory function and quality of life remain similar overtime. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic IPAA confers excellent functional results. Most patients are fully continent and have an average of six bowel movements/day. When present, minor incontinence improves over time. Laparoscopy mirrors the results of open IPAA and is a valuable alternative to open surgery.},

Fatty acid composition of plasma lipids was determined by high-resolution capillary GLC. In plasma phospholipids, significantly higher values of eicosapentaenoic (20 : 5n-3), docosapentaenoic (22 : 5n-3) and gamma-linolenic (18 : 3n-6) acids were found in control patients and patients with UC as compared to patients with CD [median % (weight by weight), control v. UC v. CD : 20 : 5n-3, 0.09 (interquartile range (IQR) 0.05) v. 0.14 (IQR 0.10) v. 0.16 (IQR 0.10), P < 0.05; 22 : 5n-3, 0.14 (IQR 0.10) v. 0.27 (IQR 0.16) v. 0.31 (IQR 0.10), P < 0.001; 18 : 3n-6, 0.02 (IQR 0.02) v. 0.03 (IQR 0.02) v. 0.05 (IQR 0.03), P < 0.05]. When compared to the control, values of the principal n-3 and n-6 long-chain PUFA, arachidonic acid (20 : 4n-6) and DHA (22 : 6n-3) were significantly higher in patients with UC but not in patients with CD [median % (w/w), UC v. control: 20 : 4n-6, 8.43 (IQR 3.23) v. 6.92 (IQR 2.96), P < 0.05; 22 : 6n-3, 1.22 (IQR 0.56) v. 0.73 (IQR 0.39), P < 0.05]. As seen there are considerable differences between the long-chain PUFA status of patients suffering from UC or CD. The data obtained in the present study do not support the concept of eicosapentaenoic acid or DHA deficiency in patients with either UC or CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyse surgical outcomes of fulminate and medically resistant ulcerative colitis (UC) carried out laparoscopically. METHOD: A prospective database identified 69 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for UC under the senior author over a 5-year period to April 2006. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (18 male patients), median BMI 26, underwent laparoscopic subtotal colectomy (LSTC): 22 acute emergencies, 10 refractory to medical therapy and unfit for restorative proctocolectomy. All were receiving iv steroids; azathioprine (7), cyclosporin (5). The median operation time was 135 min (65-280). There was one conversion. Twenty-nine patients have subsequently undergone completion proctectomy and W-pouch formation [24 patients were performed laparoscopically - laparoscopic completion proctectomy (LCP)]; widespread adhesions precluded in five patients. Twenty-six patients underwent restorative laparoscopic proctocolectomy (LRP) - one conversion. Twenty patients underwent W-pouch reconstruction via a Pfannenstiel incision. Six J-pouches were constructed and returned via the ileostomy site. Three underwent a laparoscopic pan-proctocolectomy (LPPC); one conversion. Eight patients underwent open STC. The median time to normal diet was 48 h (1-7 days) for LSTC/LCP and 36 h (1-5 days) for LRP. There were two major complications following LRP, two following LSTC, one following LCP, one following LPPC and five following open surgery. Median hospital stay was 8 days (6-72) for LSTC, 7 days (6-9) for LCP and 5 days (3-45) for LRP. There were six 30-day readmissions following laparoscopic surgery (DVT, reactive depression, ileostomy hold up (2), abdominal pain and high output ileostomy). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic subtotal and restorative proctocolectomies in fulminate and medically resistant UC are feasible, safe and largely predictable operations that allow for early hospital discharge. Laparoscopic colectomy facilitates subsequent proctectomy and pouch construction.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Laparoscopy is currently and progressively gaining acceptance for the management of colorectal disease. More bleeding and longer operating time were initially considered as contraindications to perform laparoscopic colon resections. Other obstacles were technical difficulties, the learning curve and the need for specialized instruments; however, improvements in surgical techniques and technological developments have allowed subtotal laparoscopic colectomy to be feasible. METHODS: This was a retrospective and descriptive study conducted from April 1992 to July 2006. Forty-four patients underwent laparoscopic subtotal colectomy at Texas Endosurgery Institute in San Antonio, TX. Measured variables to evaluate efficacy and safety were operating time, length of hospital stay, time to resume normal diet, conversion to open procedure, morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis and ulcerative colitis were the main surgical indications. The procedure was technically successful in 88% of patients. There were five conversions (11.3%). Mean operating time was 210 min. Morbidity and mortality rates were 29% and 2.2%, respectively. Mean length of hospital stay and time to resume normal diet were 11 and 4 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic subtotal colectomy in our institute may be considered as an effective and safe method in the management of colorectal disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe two cases of successfully prevented refeeding syndrome in a high-risk group of patients. METHODS: Case 1 was a 70-y-old woman who presented with a 4-mo history of poor dietary intake and ill health due to a connective tissue disease leading to myositis and dysphagia and complicated by respiratory failure needing mechanical ventilation. Twelve hours after starting nasogastric tube feeding, she developed a cardiac arrest from which she was successfully resuscitated. Repeated attempts to wean her from the ventilator failed. Case 2 was a 15-y-old girl who was readmitted after a total colectomy for severe ulcerative colitis with diarrhea and vomiting leading to significant weight loss. Her body mass index was 11.4 kg/m(2). RESULTS: In case 1, after consultation by the clinical nutrition team, the diagnosis of refeeding syndrome was made and the patient was duly started on a high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, multivitamin and trace-element supplements, and electrolyte infusion. Subsequently she was successfully weaned from the ventilator. In case 2, further investigation by the clinical nutrition team revealed low baseline electrolyte concentrations including potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphate and low serum albumin. Her low body mass index and baseline electrolyte concentrations put her at high risk of developing refeeding syndrome. She was initially started on low-calorie feeding, multivitamin and minerals, and her electrolytes were carefully monitored. She made a good recovery. CONCLUSION: Refeeding syndrome is a life-threatening, underdiagnosed, treatable condition but there is a need for a wider awareness of the condition among health professionals.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Functional gut symptoms are common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs) appear to play an important role in the induction of functional gut symptoms, we aimed to determine the effect of their dietary restriction on abdominal symptoms in patients with stable IBD and to examine factors associated with success of and adherence to the diet. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 52 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease and 20 with ulcerative colitis who received dietary advice at least 3 months prior at a gastrointestinal dietetic service in Victoria, Australia, underwent a retrospective telephone questionnaire. Information gathered included patient demographics, recall of dietary advice, dietary adherence, and change in gastrointestinal symptoms. RESULTS: Up to 70% of patients were adherent to the diet. Approximately one in two patients responded (defined as improvement of at least 5 out of 10 in overall symptoms). Overall abdominal symptoms, abdominal pain, bloating, wind and diarrhoea improved in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (p<0.02 for all), but constipation did not. For Crohn's disease, efficacy was associated with dietary adherence (p= 0.033) and inefficacy with non-adherence (p=0.013). Sustained response was associated with post-secondary education and working 35 h per week or less (p<0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that reduction of FODMAP intake offers an efficacious strategy for patients with IBD who have concurrent functional gut symptoms. A controlled dietary intervention trial is indicated.},

Though there are several studies evaluating nutrition in patients with IBD from the developed world, the data from developing countries are scanty, where under nutrition is predominant. METHOD: 62 patients with IBD (55 ulcerative colitis [UC] and 7 Crohn's disease [CD] patients) and 42 healthy subjects (HS) were evaluated for nutrition using dietary survey, anthropometric and biochemical parameters. RESULTS: Of the patients with IBD, 23 (37%) had active disease and 39 (63%) were in remission. Daily intake of calories (1725 Kcal/d [500-2458] vs. 2239 Kcal/d [1835-3000], p<0.0001), protein (40 g/d [19-96] vs. 50 g/d [29-73], p=0.001) and iron (9 mg/d [1-16] vs. 12 mg/d [9-16], p<0.0001) and anthropometric parameters of nutrition such as body mass index (BMI) (19.8 [13.7-27.5] vs. 23 [17.9-27.2], <0.0001), biceps (0.3 mm [0.1-1.9] vs. 0.5 mm [0.2-1.0], p<0.0001) and triceps (0.7 mm [0.2-2.9] vs. 1.2 mm [0.5-2.3], p<0.0001) skin fold thickness (BSF, TSF) and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC, 25.9 mm [15-35] vs. 26.8 mm [23-32] <0.04) were lower among the IBD patients than among the HS. Though patients with CD had a lower level of haemoglobin (median 9.2 g vs. 10.8 g, respectively; p<0.05) and serum total protein (median 6 g, range 3-7 vs. 7 g, range 3-9, respectively; p<0.05), serum albumin, BMI, BSF and TSF thicknesses, MAMC and daily intake of protein, calories, calcium and iron were comparable between UC and CD patients. Though daily dietary intake was comparable between patients with active disease and those in remission yet patients with active disease had lower BMI, MAMC and serum protein level. CONCLUSION: Under nutrition is common in patients with IBD, particularly in those with acute exacerbation.},

The postoperative complications are frequent but the definitive outcome is acceptable. AIM: our aim was to evaluate the long term functional outcome in a series of consecutive patients with IP and to establish its relation with postoperative complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: we included 144 patients categorized in two groups: I--patients without postoperative complications (n: 71); II--patients with postoperative complications (n: 73). Patients were followed for a median time of 3.8 years (range 1-15). We evaluated: stool frequency, anal discrimination between gas and stool, voluntary evacuation inhibition, requirement of antidiarrheal medications and presence of incontinence. RESULTS: the functional outcome was similar between the two groups in terms of stool fequency medication use, anal discrimination and the voluntary inhibition of evacuation for more than 5 hours. A trend to present seepage was seen in patients with complications (34%) more than in those without them (20%; p<0.08 NS). Compared with group II, seepage in group I was significantly related with dietary lapses (p<0.01). The most frequent complication in incontinent patients was pelvic sepsis (56%). CONCLUSIONS: our study showed that most of long-term functional parameters are not influenced by the presence of postoperative complications. However, a trend for incontinence seems to be related to postoperative complications, more frequently with pelvic sepsis.},

   abstract = {In genetically susceptible individuals, an altered mucosal immune response against some commensal bacteria of the gut ecosystem appears to be the principal mechanism leading to intestinal lesions in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The information currently available does not provide an exact explanation about the origin of this important dysfunction of the interaction between host and commensal bacteria, but an altered microbial composition has been detected in the gut ecosystem of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Prebiotics are food ingredients not digested nor absorbed in the upper intestinal tract that are fermented by intestinal bacteria in a selective way promoting changes in the gut ecosystem. Experimental and human studies have shown that inulin and oligofructose stimulate saccharolysis in the colonic lumen and favour the growth of indigenous lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with reduced mucosal inflammation in animal models of IBD. Strong experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that inulin and oligofructose can offer an opportunity to prevent or mitigate intestinal inflammatory lesions in human Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis. Encouraging results have been obtained in preliminary clinical trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: The causes of ulcerative colitis are unknown, although it is plausible that dietary factors are involved. Case-control studies of diet and ulcerative colitis are subject to recall biases. The aim of this study was to examine the prospective relationship between the intake of nutrients and the development of ulcerative colitis in a cohort study. METHODS: The study population was 260,686 men and women aged 20-80 years, participating in a large European prospective cohort study (EPIC). Participants were residents in the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Germany or Italy. Information on diet was supplied and the subjects were followed up for the development of ulcerative colitis. Each incident case was matched with four controls and dietary variables were divided into quartiles. RESULTS: A total of 139 subjects with incident ulcerative colitis were identified. No dietary associations were detected, apart from a marginally significant positive association with an increasing percentage intake of energy from total polyunsaturated fatty acids (trend across quartiles OR = 1.19 (95% CI = 0.99-1.43) p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: No associations between ulcerative colitis and diet were detected, apart from a possible increased risk with a higher total polyunsaturated fatty acid intake. A biological mechanism exists in that polyunsaturated fatty acids are metabolised to pro-inflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {Chemoprevention means the use of agents to prevent, delay, or reverse carcinogenesis. This review was designed to critically discuss the most promising agents in colorectal cancer (CRC) chemoprevention. Aspirin is the best studied chemopreventive agent for CRC. Optimal chemoprevention requires long-term use and high dose of aspirin that may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may also be candidates for chemoprevention. The regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, however, causes adverse effects including gastrointestinal bleeding, and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may increase the risk of cardiovascular events. In patients with ulcerative colitis 5-aminosalicylates reduce the risk of CRC and dysplasia. Ursodeoxycholic acid can reduce the risk of dysplasia or CRC in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis. Current data are insufficient to support the use of hormone replacement therapy to reduce the risk of CRC. Statins may have chemopreventive effects, but further investigation of their overall benefits in preventing CRC is warranted. Antioxidant supplements cannot prevent CRC. The usefulness of selenium, folate, calcium, and vitamin D awaits further evaluation. Chemoprevention cannot yet be accepted as standard medical practice. Use of chemopreventive agents cannot be a substitute for colorectal surveillance.},

   abstract = {Around 1 in 4 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) present in childhood, the majority around the time of their pubertal growth spurt. This presents challenges over and above those of managing IBD in adults as this period is a time of dramatic psychological and physical transition for a child. Growth and nutrition are key priorities in the management of adolescents and young adults with IBD. Growth failure in IBD is characterized by delayed skeletal maturation and a delayed onset of puberty, and is best described in terms of height-for-age standard deviation score (Z score) or by variations in growth velocity over a period of 3-4 months. Growth failure is common at presentation in Crohn's disease (CD), but less common in ulcerative colitis (UC). The etiology of growth failure is multifactorial. Principal determinants, however, include the inflammatory process per se, with proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1beta, IL-6) being directly implicated. Furthermore, poor nutrition and the consequences of prolonged corticosteroid use also contribute to the significant reduction in final adult height of almost 1 in 5 children. Initially a prompt, where possible steroid-free, induction of remission is indicated. The ideal is then to sustain a relapse-free remission until growth is complete, which is often not until early adulthood. These goals can often be achieved with a combination of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) and early use of immunosuppressants. The advent of potent and efficacious biological agents considerably improves the range of growth-sparing interventions available to children around puberty, although well-timed surgery remains another highly effective means of achieving remission and significant catch-up growth. We carried out a systematic review of publications to identify the best available evidence for managing growth failure in children with IBD. Despite the paucity of high-quality publications, sufficient data were available in the literature to allow practical, evidence-based where possible, management guidelines to be formulated. Although there is clear evidence that exclusive enteral nutrition achieves mucosal healing, its effect on growth has only been assessed at 6 months. In contrast to corticosteroids, EEN has no negative effect on growth. Corticosteroids remain the key therapy responsible for medication-induced growth impairment, although the use of budesonide in selected patients may minimize the steroid effect on dividing growth plates. Immunosuppressants have become a mainstay of treatment in children with IBD, and are being used earlier in the disease course than ever before. However, there are currently no long-term data reporting better growth outcome if these agents are introduced very soon after diagnosis. In comparison, recent data from a large prospective trial of infliximab in children with moderate to severe CD suggested significant catch-up growth during the first year of regular infusions. The only other intervention that has documented clear catch-up growth has been surgical resection. Resection of localized CD, in otherwise treatment-resistant children, early in the disease process achieves clear catch-up growth within the next 6 months. There are no data available that growth hormone improves final adult height in children with CD. In conjunction with expert endocrinological support, pubertal delay, more common in boys, may be treated with parenteral testosterone if causing significant psychological problems. The optimal management of children and adolescents requires a multidisciplinary approach frequently available within the pediatric healthcare setting. Dedicated dietetic support, along with nurse-specialist, child psychologist, and with closely linked medical and surgical care will likely achieve the best possible start for children facing a lifetime of chronic gut disease.},

DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4 patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20 IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P = 0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7 ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400 microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis should be explored further.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) exhibit an increased risk for the development of cancer of the colon and rectum. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are known to suppress sporadic colorectal cancer, but it is unknown whether selective COX-2 inhibitors exhibit a preventive effect in UC-associated neoplasia. This study investigated the preventive effect of nimesulide, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, on colorectal carcinogenesis in an experimental model of murine UC. METHODS: Chronic colitis was induced in mice by administration of four cycles of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) (each cycle: 5% DSS for 7 days and then distilled water for 14 days). The mice were killed 120 days after the completion of the fourth cycle. The mice were divided into the following five groups: group A served as a disease control; group B received a diet mixed with 400 p.p.m. of nimesulide during the whole period; group C received nimesulide during the four cycles of DSS administration (active phase); group D received nimesulide for 120 days from the end of the fourth cycle (remission phase); group E received no agents including DSS and served as a normal control. RESULTS: The incidence of dysplasia and/or cancer was 28%, 15%, 11.8%, 6.7% and 0% in groups A-E, respectively. In group D, nimesulide significantly suppressed the occurrence of dysplasia and/or cancer (P < 0.05). Strong COX-2 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in cancer and dysplastic lesions while diffusely weak COX-2 expression was also found in the residual colon (i.e. lesion-free colon). The mucosal concentration of prostaglandin E(2) was significantly lower in groups B and D than in group A. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of the selective COX-2 inhibitor nimesulide (especially during the remission phase) exerts a suppressive effect on the development of dysplasia and/or cancer in a murine model of DSS-induced colitis. These findings may have relevance to long-standing UC in humans.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Probiotics, defined as live micro-organisms with beneficial effects for the host, are widely applied in gastrointestinal and liver diseases. AIM AND METHOD: To review the available evidence of clinical trials on probiotics in gastrointestinal and liver diseases, with a major focus on irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis and chronic liver diseases. RESULTS: Evidence for the therapeutic or preventive application of particular probiotic strains is available for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, rota-virus-associated diarrhoea and pouchitis. Results are encouraging for irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and for reducing side effects by Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies, but are less clear for Crohn's disease, lactose intolerance and constipation. In general, for most of these patient groups, more placebo-controlled methodologically well-designed studies that pay attention to both clinical outcome and mechanistic aspects are required. The application in liver disease and pancreatitis is promising, but more human trials have to be awaited. Possible mechanisms of probiotics include modulation of the intestinal microbiota and the immune system, but different bacterial may have different effects. CONCLUSION: Further insight into disease entities and the functioning of probiotic strains is required to be able to select disease-specific strains, which have to be tested in well-designed placebo-controlled studies.},

   abstract = {Nutrition may play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of ulcerative colitis. Several studies suggest an association between dietary factors and the onset of ulcerative colitis; however, only few studies have examined the relationship between dietary intake and relapse of ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to assess the dietary intake and antioxidative capacity of ulcerative colitis patients and to elucidate the efficacy of dietary therapy for ulcerative colitis. Dietary intake, fatty acid composition of phospholipids in plasma and neutrophils, serum fat-soluble vitamin levels, and oxygen radical absorbance capacity were analyzed in 29 ulcerative colitis patients (7 males and 22 females), who were treated at the Department of Gastroenterology, Okayama University Hospital. Total fat intake, fat energy ratio and linoleic acid intake were significantly lower, while protein and carbohydrate intakes were significantly higher, in the patients than age- and sex-matched controls. In the neutrophil phospholipids of ulcerative colitis patients, significantly higher levels of linoleic aicd and arachidonic acid and a lower level of eicosapentaenoic acid were observed. The concentrations of serum retinol and beta-carotene but not alpha-tocopherol were significantly lower and serum oxygen radical absorbance capacity was also lower than in the controls. Significant correlations between serum oxygen radical absorbance capacity and retinol (r = 0.567, p = 0.0031), alpha-tocopherol (r = 0.560, p = 0.0036) and beta-carotene (r = 0.440, p = 0.0279) concentrations were observed in the ulcerative colitis patients. A diet restricting the intake of linoleic acid and supplemented with eicosapentaenoic acid and antioxidative vitamins may be recommendable for the nutritional management of ulcerative colitis patients.},

There are no reports on the status of BMD in Indian patients with IBD. METHODS: Dietary calcium intake and cumulative steroid and immunosuppressive drug use was noted in 46 randomly selected patients (mean [SD] age 40.5 [14.7] years; 28 men) with IBD (ulcerative colitis 22, Crohn's disease 24). To compare values of BMD for patients, data from 46 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (age 40.5 [14.6] years; 28 men) were selected from an existing database of healthy Indian volunteers whose BMD had been measured in a community-based survey carried out among people residing in Delhi (unpublished data). BMD was measured using DXA (Hologic QDR 4500). Osteopenia and osteoporosis were defined as per the standard WHO criteria. RESULTS: The mean duration of disease was 87.7 (78.3) months. The mean calcium intake by 41 patients (89.1%) was <200 mg/day, by 2 patients (4.3%) 200-400 mg/day and by 3 patients (6.4%)>400 mg/day. Significantly lower values of BMD at the spine and hip regions were seen in patients with both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease as compared with Indian healthy controls. In comparison to age- and sex-matched healthy controls, 29 (63%) and 21 (45.6%) patients had either osteopenia or osteoporosis at the spine and hip region, respectively. Of them, 4 and 7 patients had osteoporosis at the spine and hip region, respectively. There was no correlation between values of BMD and the age of patient, duration of disease, and cumulative steroid dose. CONCLUSIONS: Two thirds of Indian patients with IBD have low BMD. Since the intake of dietary calcium is inadequate in a majority of these patients, they should be advised to increase the intake of dairy products.},

   abstract = {In the last decades there has been continual interest in site-specific delivery to the colon. Recently, new types of site-specific delivery formulations have been developed for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and other colon related diseases. The aim of the present study was to establish a physiologically relevant IVIVC for two prototypes using a prospective in vitro study. Caffeine, a drug being absorbed along the entire gastrointestinal tract, was selected as a model drug. USP apparatus 3, the BioDis, was used for all experiments and the passage through the gastrointestinal tract was simulated with a physiologically based pH-gradient. Subsequently, the fraction of drug released in vitro was compared with the fraction of drug released in vivo, which was determined in humans in a separate study. Results indicated that the BioDis method is very useful in terms of predicting the site/timing and extent of drug release from the prototypes, since an a priori IVIVC could be established. Moreover, from the results generated in the present study, it is obvious that novel pH- and time-based multi-unit formulations would improve selectivity of drug delivery to the distal ileum and the colon and therefore might be very helpful in the treatment of colonic diseases.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK), menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of these vitamins.},

Traditionally, the incidence of IBD was higher in the developed, industrialized countries, in contrast, nowadays it became more prevalent in the previously low incidence areas. In particular, the incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is similar to that observed in North America and Western Europe, while the incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) in developing countries is still low, suggesting that the environmental factors may act faster or differently in UC than in CD. In Europe, the North to South gradient disappeared, and also the West to East gradient is diminishing. Smoking and appendectomy may be considered as important environmental factors in both UC and CD, however, with opposite effects. In addition, the use of oral contraceptives is associated to disease susceptibility in both diseases. The role of diet, perinatal events, stress and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the pathogenesis is still controversial.},

   abstract = {Curcumin (diferulolylmethane) demonstrates profound anti-inflammatory effects in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and in immune cells in vitro and exhibits a protective role in rodent models of chemically induced colitis, with its presumed primary mechanism of action via inhibition of NF-kappaB. Although it has been demonstrated effective in reducing relapse rate in ulcerative colitis patients, curcumin's effectiveness in Crohn's disease (CD) or in Th-1/Th-17 mediated immune models of CD has not been evaluated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of dietary curcumin (0.1-1%) on the development of colitis, immune activation, and in vivo NF-kappaB activity in germ-free IL-10(-/-) or IL-10(-/-);NF-kappaB(EGFP) mice colonized with specific pathogen-free microflora. Proximal and distal colon morphology showed a mild protective effect of curcumin only at 0.1%. Colonic IFN-gamma and IL-12/23p40 mRNA expression followed similar pattern ( approximately 50% inhibition at 0.1%). Secretion of IL-12/23p40 and IFN-gamma by colonic explants and mesenteric lymph node cells was elevated in IL-10(-/-) mice and was not decreased by dietary curcumin. Surprisingly, activation of NF-kappaB in IL-10(-/-) mice (phospho-NF-kappaBp65) or in IL-10(-/-);NF-kappaB(EGFP) mice (whole organ or confocal imaging) was not noticeably inhibited by curcumin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IL-10 and curcumin act synergistically to downregulate NF-kappaB activity in IEC and IL-12/23p40 production by splenocytes and dendritic cells. In conclusion, curcumin demonstrates limited effectiveness on Th-1 mediated colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice, with moderately improved colonic morphology, but with no significant effect on pathogenic T cell responses and in situ NF-kappaB activity. In vitro studies suggest that the protective effects of curcumin are IL-10 dependent.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, also called chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), affect up to 500 per 100,000 persons in the Western world. Recent studies in the etiology of IBD suggest that these diseases are caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Results from humans and especially animal models of colitis reported by our group and others have indicated that these diseases result from a lack of tolerance to resident intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible hosts. Probiotic bacteria have health-promoting effects for the host when ingested and have also shown efficacy in ulcerative colitis and refractory pouchitis. In light of the efficacy of providing probiotic bacteria to patients with IBD, there has been interest in the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of inulin, oligofructose, and other prebiotics for patients with or at risk of IBD. Prebiotics are nondigestible dietary oligosaccharides that affect the host by selectively stimulating growth, activity, or both of selective intestinal (probiotic) bacteria. Prebiotics are easy to administer and, in contrast to probiotic therapy, do not require administration of large amounts of (live) bacteria and are therefore easier to administer. Studies using prebiotics, especially beta-fructan oligosaccharides, for the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation have shown benefit in animal models of colitis. Studies using these prebiotics alone or in combination with probiotics are emerging and have shown promise. These dietary therapies could lead to novel treatments for these chronic debilitating diseases.},

Diagnosis and management of a patient with nipple valve stricture and partial bowel obstruction associated with dietary supplement retention in the pouch reservoir is described. A 50-year-old female patient with ulcerative colitis and a 15-year history of continent ileostomy after total proctocolectomy reported 5-week symptoms of abdominal pain and difficulty in intubating the pouch. Pill bezoar composed of dietary supplement was found in diagnostic pouch endoscopy. Therapeutic pouch endoscopy was performed with balloon dilation of a nipple valve stenosis and retrieval of 224 dietary supplement tablets. Pill bezoar in the pouch is rare. However, patients with continent ileostomy should be advised to avoid taking hard-to-dissolve foods and medications.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammation is a well recognized risk factor for cancer and patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis (UC) are at an increased risk for colorectal carcinoma development. In order to prevent UC associated carcinogenesis, we tested the effects of inositol compounds (including inositol and hexaphosphate inositol) on UC-associated carcinogenesis in our novel mouse model. Female C57BL/6 mice were subjected to long-term, cyclic dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment and fed a 2-fold iron-enriched diet. The inositol compounds were administered via the drinking fluid. In the DSS-plus-2-fold iron positive control group, colorectal adenocarcinoma incidence was 70.6% (24/34 mice) after 15 cycles of DSS treatment (1 DSS cycle=7 day DSS treatment period followed by a 10 day recovery period). Tumor multiplicity was 1.26+/-1.05 and tumor volume was 21.4+/-5.2 mm3. Adding 1% inositol, tumor incidence was statistically significantly reduced (42%, 9 of 21 mice with tumors), as was tumor multiplicity (0.5+/-0.7) and tumor volume (4.2+/-1.9 mm3). Administration of hexaphosphate inositol noticeably reduced tumor incidence (50%, 12 mice with tumors out of 24 total), tumor multiplicity (0.8+/-0.9) and tumor volume (12.3+/-4.1 mm3); however, the results were not statistically significant (P>0.05). Further mechanistic studies showed that the inhibition of UC-associated carcinogenesis by inositol compounds might relate to their function on the modulation of macrophage mediated inflammation, nitro-oxidative stress and cell proliferation in UC-associated carcinogenesis. This study indicates that inositol compounds may have the potential to serve as preventive agents for chronic inflammation-carcinogenesis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate bone mineral density of the lumbar spine in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease, and to identify the clinical risk factors associated with low bone mineral density. METHODS: Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in 40 patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Patients were 11.8 (SD = 4.1) years old and most of them were male (52.5%). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify potential associations between bone mineral density Z-score and age, height-for-age Z-score, BMI Z-score, cumulative corticosteroid dose in milligrams and in milligrams per kilogram, disease duration, number of relapses, and calcium intake according to the dietary reference intake. RESULTS: Low bone mineral density (Z-score bellow -2) was observed in 25% of patients. Patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis had equivalent prevalence of low bone mineral density. Multiple linear regression models demonstrated that height-for-age Z-score, BMI Z-score, and cumulative corticosteroid dose in mg had independent effects on BMD, respectively, beta = 0.492 (P = 0.000), beta = 0.460 (P = 0.001), beta = - 0.014 (P = 0.000), and these effects remained significant after adjustments for disease duration, respectively, beta = 0.489 (P = 0.013), beta = 0.467 (P = 0.001), and beta = - 0.005 (P = 0.015). The model accounted for 54.6% of the variability of the BMD Z-score (adjusted R2 = 0.546). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of low bone mineral density in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease is considerably high and independent risk factors associated with bone mineral density are corticosteroid cumulative dose in milligrams, height-for-age Z-score, and BMI Z-score.},

We studied 20 healthy controls and 20 subjects with IBD, 15 of whom had Crohn's disease and five with ulcerative colitis. All the subjects consumed Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 supplemented yogurt for 30 days. The presence of putative regulatory T (T(reg)) cells (CD4(+) CD25(high)) and cytokines in T cells, monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) was determined by flow cytometry from peripheral blood before and after treatment, with or without ex vivo stimulation. Serum and faecal cytokine concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The proportion of CD4(+) CD25(high) T cells increased significantly (P = 0.007) in IBD patients, mean (95% confidence interval: CI) 0.84% (95% CI 0.55-1.12) before and 1.25% (95% CI 0.97-1.54) after treatment, but non-significantly in controls. The basal proportion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha(+)/interleukin (IL)-12(+) monocytes and myeloid DC decreased in both subject groups, but of stimulated cells only in IBD patients. Also serum IL-12 concentrations and proportions of IL-2(+) and CD69(+) T cells from stimulated cells decreased in IBD patients. The increase in CD4(+) CD25(high) T cells correlated with the decrease in the percentage of TNF-alpha- or IL-12-producing monocytes and DC. The effect of the probiotic yogurt was confirmed by a follow-up study in which subjects consumed the yogurt without the probiotic organisms. Probiotic yogurt intake was associated with significant anti-inflammatory effects that paralleled the expansion of peripheral pool of putative T(reg) cells in IBD patients and with few effects in controls.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is an inflammatory condition affecting the colon with an incidence of approximately 10-20 per 100,000 per year. No existing intervention is effective in all patients with a proportion requiring colectomy. There are significant proportion of patients who experience adverse effects with current therapies. Consequently, new alternatives for the treatment of UC are constantly being sought. Probiotics are live microbial feed supplements that may beneficially affect the host by improving intestinal microbial balance, enhancing gut barrier function and improving local immune response. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of probiotics compared with placebo or standard medical treatment (5-aminosalicylates, sulfasalazine or corticosteroids) for the induction of remission in active ulcerative colitis. SEARCH STRATEGY: A comprehensive search for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT's) was carried out using MEDLINE (1966-January 2006), EMBASE (January 1985- 2006) and CENTRAL. The Cochrane IBD/FBD Review Group Specialised Trials Registrar was also searched. The Australasian Medical Index, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and the Japan Information Centre of Science and Technology File on Science, Technology and Medicine (JICST-E) were also used to identify abstracts. Conference proceedings from the Falk Symposium, Digestive Disease Week (DDW) and the United European Digestive Disease week were hand-searched. Authors of relevant studies and drug companies were contacted regarding ongoing or unpublished trials that may be relevant to the review. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of probiotics compared to standard treatments in the induction of remission of active ulcerative colitis DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data for analysis. Data were analysed using RevMan 4.2.7. A formal meta-analysis was not preformed due to differences in probiotics, outcomes and trial methodology. MAIN RESULTS: None of the included studies reported any statistically significant differences in remission or clinical improvement rates between probiotic and placebo or active comparator groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Conventional therapy combined with a probiotic does not improve overall remission rates in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. However, there is limited evidence that probiotics added to standard therapy may provide modest benefits in terms of reduction of disease activity in patients with mild to moderately severe ulcerative colitis. Whether probiotics are as effective in patients with severe and more extensive disease and whether they can be used as an alternative to existing therapies is unknown. Further well designed, larger randomised controlled trials are needed to determine whether probiotics can be used as an alternative to current treatment modalities.},

METHODS: We compared 9 ischemic colitis patients (2 men, 7 women) with ulcers treated by bowel rest only from 2000 to 2005 (conventional therapy group), with 6 patients (2 men, 4 women) treated by rebamipide enema therapy in 2006 (rebamipide enema therapy group) and analyzed the mean duration of fasting and hospitalization, degree of ulcer healing, and decrease in WBC count for the two groups. RESULTS: The mean duration of fasting and hospitalization were 2.7+/-1.8 d and 9.2+/-1.5 d in the rebamipide group and 7.9+/-4.1 d and 17.9+/-6.8 d in the control group, respectively, and significantly reduced in the rebamipide group (t= -2.915; P=0.0121 and t= -3.054; P=0.0092). As for the degree of ulcer healing at 7 d after admission, the ulcer score was reduced by 3.5+/-0.5 (points) in the rebamipide group and 2.8+/-0.5 (points) in the control group (t=1.975; P=0.0797), while the decrease in WBC count was 120.0+/-55.8 (x 10(2)/microL) in the rebamipide group and 85.9+/-56.8 (x 10(2)/microL) in the control group (t=1.006; P=0.3360). CONCLUSION: In left-sided ischemic colitis patients with ulcers, rebamipide enema therapy significantly reduced the duration of fasting and hospitalization, recommending its use as a new and effective therapeutic alternative.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the immunoregulatory effects of omega-3 fatty acid and adiponectin have been postulated, their role in intestinal inflammation is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine whether dietary fat intake influences activity of colonic inflammation through modulating this system. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice received dextran sulfate sodium for induction of colitis. Mice were fed a control diet, omega-3 fat-rich diet, omega-6 fat-rich diet, or saturated fat-rich diet. Some mice were administered a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma; agonist, pioglitazone. Messenger RNA expression of adiponectin and its receptors were analyzed. Adiponectin expression in colonic mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients was also analyzed. RESULTS: The receptors for adiponectin were found to be ubiquitously expressed in epithelial cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, lamina proprial mononuclear cells, and subepithelial myofibroblasts from colonic tissue, but adiponectin was only expressed in myofibroblasts. Induction of colitis significantly decreased the expression of adiponectin in colonic mucosa. The omega-3 fat diet group, but not the other fat diet groups, showed exacerbated colitis with a further decrease of adiponectin expression. Pioglitazone treatment ameliorated the level of decrease in adiponectin expression and improved colonic inflammation induced by the omega-3 fat-rich diet. In patients with ulcerative colitis, the expression level of adiponectin in colonic mucosa was also decreased compared with that in control mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin was found to be expressed in myofibroblasts. Adiponectin expression was significantly suppressed by induction of colitis, and aggravation of colitis after exposure to omega-3 fat may be due to a further decrease in the expression level of adiponectin.},

   abstract = {Nowadays, the regular consumption of pre- and probiotics is recommended to provide various positive health benefits. The in vitro and in vivo demonstrated actions on the intestinal microflora, the mucosal barrier and the immunological system are very interesting to propose beneficial health effects, but the scientific proof in humans is not demonstrated yet. Pre- and probiotics are very active in the intestinal tract (mainly in the colon) by maintaining a healthy gut microflora and influencing metabolic, trophic and protective mechanism. Prebiotics stimulates the growth of apathogen bacteria and increase the short chain fatty acid concentration by fermentation. Short chain fatty acids are necessary substrates for a healthy gut. Probiotics inhibit the growth of pathogen bacteria, reduce the translocation of bacteria and toxins and modulate the intestinal immune system. For some specific clinical diseases (ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, diarrhoea) a therapeutic and prophylactic effect with pre- and probiotics was shown. In the near future more indications for pre- and probiotics (used as a single strain or as in a combination) will be added. Promising results are already shown in irritable bowel syndrome, prevention of antibiotic induced diarrhoea, in surgical and in intensive care patients. Future studies should focus to determine the characteristics of a healthy gut and the evaluation of specific health benefits by well-designed, controlled human studies of adequate duration.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a spectrum of diseases in which inflammation leads to acute and chronic gut injury. It is a growing health issue for which no cure exists. The pathogenesis is multifactorial with links to infectious and environmental events that trigger disease in genetically predisposed individuals. Treatment of the two major forms of IBD, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, involves the reduction of inflammation with toxic immunosuppressive drugs or blocking of the pro-inflammatory effects of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) with antibodies. Here, we show that the oral administration of transgenic low-alkaloid tobacco expressing the contra-inflammatory cytokine human interleukin-10 (hIL-10) reduces the severity of colitis by down-regulating TNF-alpha expression directly at the sites of inflammation in IBD-susceptible IL-10(-/-) mice. hIL-10 expressed in plants is biologically active and displays resistance to gastrointestinal degradation. Dietary supplementation with plant tissue delivering up to 9 microg of hIL-10 daily for 4 weeks was well tolerated by treated mice. Gut histology was significantly improved relative to controls (P = 0.002), and was correlated with a decrease in small bowel TNF-alpha mRNA levels and an increase in IL-2 and IL-1beta mRNA levels. Transgenic plants expressing IL-10 to directly attenuate TNF-alpha expression at sites of inflammation in the gut may become a useful new approach in the luminal therapy of IBD.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Continuous flow culture (CFC) models of the human colonic microbiota inoculated with faeces from UC and non-UC volunteers were maintained on BSA as growth substrate. Changes in bacterial populations and short-chain fatty acids were determined. UC and non-UC microbiota differed significantly in microbial populations, with elevated numbers of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and clostridia in the microbiota from UC patients. Compared with native BSA, glycated BSA modulated the gut microbiota of UC patients in vitro towards a more detrimental community structure with significant increases in putatively harmful bacteria (clostridia, bacteroides and SRB; P < 0.009) and decreases in dominant and putatively beneficial bacterial groups (eubacteria and bifidobacteria; P < 0.0004). The levels of beneficial short-chain fatty acids were significantly decreased by heated or glycated BSA, but were increased significantly by native BSA. CONCLUSION: The UC colonic microbiota maintained in CFC was significantly modified by glycated BSA. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results suggest that dietary glycated protein may impact upon the composition and activity of the colonic microbiota, an important environmental variable in UC.},

   abstract = {The prevalence of diverticulosis and colorectal cancer (CRC) is markedly increased in the last century. Both diseases are highly frequent in Western countries and in aged people. Western diet--low in fiber and rich in dietary fat--has been largely regarded to play a major role in the pathogenesis of both conditions. A causal relationship between diverticulosis and CRC has been suggested in different studies. Epidemiologic series found a more frequent rectosigmoid localization of neoplastic lesions (advanced adenoma and CRC) in patients with diverticulosis as compared with controls, particularly in those with a previous diverticulitis episode or with an extensive disease. However, data are still controversial, with other studies failing to confirm this observation. Such discrepancy could be referred to the highly heterogeneous study design and setting in the different epidemiologic series. Pathologic studies showed that either macroscopic and microscopic chronic inflammation--which is regarded as risk factor for CRC development--is present in the colonic mucosa of some patients with diverticula. Moreover, alterations in the extracellular matrix, also involved in colorectal carcinogenesis, have been depicted in diverticulosis. In addition, an upward shifting of cell proliferation occurs in diverticular mucosa, and in nondiverticular patients with advanced adenomas. Finally, aberrant crypt foci--which are considered potential markers of CRC risk in ulcerative colitis--have been detected in colonic mucosa of patients with diverticulosis. Despite this substantial amount of evidence, however, the available data are not yet strong enough to suggest a more aggressive CRC prevention in diverticular as compared with nondiverticular subjects.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Carboxylic acids (CAs), especially butyric acid, have been suggested to counteract colonic diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and colon cancer. Colonic formation of CAs can be influenced by the diet, but the concentrations and pattern formed need to be evaluated for different food products in humans. To elucidate how the colonic concentration of CAs in healthy subjects is influenced by dietary supplementation with oat bran, and whether the concentration varies over time and during consecutive days. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Twenty-five healthy subjects (age 24+/-1.3) were recruited to the study. The subjects were given 40 g beta-glucan enriched oat bran per day, corresponding to 20 g dietary fibre, in 4 slices of bread. CAs were analysed in faeces during three consecutive days after 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks on this diet. RESULTS: The concentration of acetic, propionic, butyric, isobutyric and isovaleric acid was higher (P<0.05-0.001) after 8 weeks on the oat bran diet as compared with values at entry, whereas that of lactic acid was lower (P<0.05). After 12 weeks, the concentrations of acetic, propionic and isobutyric acid were still higher and that of lactic acid lower. The variation between individuals was considerable, whereas in the same individuals there was little variation. CONCLUSIONS: Oat bran increased the faecal concentration of CAs after 8 weeks, indicating an increased concentration also in the distal colon. The concentration of all main acids increased, except for lactic acid, which decreased. Oat bran may therefore have a preventive potential adjunct to colonic diseases.},

With a high level of evidence, it is concluded that the use of certain strains of probiotics significantly reduces the risk for antibiotic-induced diarrhea. Although further studies are needed, the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics in people suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (particularly ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis) might improve the rates of remission induction/maintenance. The administration of probiotics and symbiotics to patients with liver transplant, severe acute pancreatitis, and intensive and surgical care patients, emerges as a promising therapeutic option that seems to reduce the number of infections; however, it is currently no possible to establish evidence-based recommendations, with a need for a higher number of better designed works. About safety of probiotics and symbiotics, the benefits/risks ratio clearly favors the former since the risk for infection is low, even in immunosuppressed patients. There are, however, selected groups of patients in which caution is advised.},

No significant differences have been shown in the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and hole protein formulae for TF. In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid dependent patients in CD. In patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the adaptation phase and should be changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in addition to normal food. Special nutrition support should not be used routinely in patients with mild or moderate acute pancreatitis. EN is the preffered route in patients with pancreatitis and should be attempted before initiating parenteral nutrition. Nutrition assessment in patients with liver disease should include screening for micronutrient deficiencies. Protein restriction should be implemented for the acute management of hepatic encephalopathy and should not be implemented chronically in patients with liver disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Short bowel syndrome patients frequently experience impaired health-related quality of life. This syndrome is also associated with increased costs for the individuals concerned and the community. Intake of specially processed cereals has been demonstrated to decrease intestinal secretion. This study evaluates the effect of a supplementary diet with specially processed cereals compared with nonprocessed cereals. METHODS: This investigation is a randomized double-blind, cross-over multicentre prospective study of 26 intestinal resected out patients, considered as short bowel syndrome patients. The patients were divided into groups A or B, in accordance with the first allocated treatment. Subgroup analyses of the underlying diagnoses and type of surgical procedure were performed. The studied parameters were faecal volume, nocturnal stools, abdominal pain/discomfort, health-related quality of life, peripheral blood tests and anthropometric data. RESULTS: In both groups, intake of nonprocessed cereals significantly decreased the faecal volume. The subgroup analyses of patients with a history of ulcerative colitis (compared with Crohn's disease) and nonileostomy-operated procedure (compared with ileostomi-operated procedure) showed significantly decreased faecal volume during nonprocessed cereals intake. Peripheral blood tests, quality of life and anthropometry were not affected. CONCLUSION: In this study, nonprocessed cereals seemed to be as effective as specially processed cereals in decreasing faecal volume in general and especially in ulcerative colitis patients (mainly operated with nonileostomy techniques). Our results indicate that use of supplementary cereals is safe for this group of patients, but should optimally include evaluation of the underlying diagnosis and the surgical method used.},

   abstract = {Corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid are the primary standard therapy for inflammatory bowel disease. Recent immunologic data implicate an involvement of mast cell activation followed by increased histamine secretion and elevated tissue concentrations of histamine in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. In the present case, the clinical course of a 35-year-old man with steroid-dependent chronic active ulcerative colitis, who did not respond to high-dose steroids, antibiotics, or azathioprine during 3 years, is reported. Clinical disease activity and established serological markers were recorded during 6 weeks of unsuccessful therapy and during the next 6 weeks, as a new nonsedative antihistaminergic drug, a mast cell stabilizer, and an hypoallergenic diet were implemented in addition to conventional therapy. Induction of remission was achieved within 2 weeks after treatment with fexofenadine, disodium cromoglycate, and an amino acid-based formula. Clinical disease activity, stool frequency, leukocytes, c-reactive protein, and orosomucoid levels in serum decreased rapidly. Daily steroid administration could be gradually reduced along with 6 weeks of this treatment. This report suggests that histamine and mast cell activity may be important pathophysiological factors responsible for persistent clinical and mucosal inflammatory activity in ulcerative colitis despite the use of steroids. In ulcerative colitis, patients unresponsive to conventional treatment, therapeutic considerations should also include an antiallergic approach when further signs of atopy or intestinal hypersensitivity are present.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The majority of young adults referred with rectal bleeding to a colorectal specialist clinic have a very low risk of serious disease such as cancer, and a high chance of gaining symptom relief by simple dietary changes. To determine whether young low-risk patients with rectal bleeding can be managed with a structured telephonic interview and dietary advice, rather than an outpatient visit. METHOD: A single-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial was performed in two stages. Patients under 40 years with rectal bleeding only were offered inclusion. Part-I trial: Patients were interviewed on telephone by the colorectal nurse specialist (CNS) and randomized to receive dietary advice (Advice Group) or not (Control Group). All patients were seen in clinic 6 weeks later by a doctor 'blinded' to their trial status. Part-II trial: Patients were interviewed on telephone by the CNS and again randomized to an Advice Group or a Control Group. The Control Group were seen in clinic 6 weeks later. The Advice Group were telephoned again 6 weeks later, and if their bleeding had stopped, were not brought to clinic. All patients were tracked for a year after the study to ensure no adverse diagnoses came to light. RESULTS: Part-I trial: 63 of 89 eligible patients were contactable and none refused the study. Seventy per cent of the Advice Group compared with 33% (P = 0.001) of the Control Group had symptomatic improvement when seen in clinic. Approximately 30% of each group required further treatment. Part-II trial: 54 of 94 eligible patients were contactable. However a further nine declined to enter the trial; 90% of patients in the Advice Group had improved at 6 weeks as judged by telephone interview compared with 56% of patients in the Control Group (P = 0.024) who were seen in clinic. The 90% of patients who improved in the Advice Group did not need to come to clinic to be seen. In both parts of the trial, the CNS identified a small number of patients with urgent symptoms at interview and brought them to clinic. The majority had anal fissures or haemorrhoids although in Part-II, one patient had ulcerative colitis and one had colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION: Telephonic consultation is an effective way of identifying those patients with urgent symptoms among a cohort of young adults referred to the hospital with rectal bleeding. Telephonic dietary advice leads to resolution of rectal bleeding in the majority of patients without urgent symptoms.},

In addition, patients with inflammatory bowel disease are often found to have nutrient deficiencies at the time of diagnosis, whereas others develop features of malnutrition over the course of their illness. Therefore, an understanding of the relationship between nutrients and inflammatory bowel disease is important if these patients are to receive optimal care. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiologic and basic research has helped to shed light on the interaction between diet and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Numerous clinical trials utilizing various types of lipids, including fish oil and short chain fatty acids, suggest that fats play an important role in the inflammatory response that characterizes inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamins and other micronutrients involved in nutrient metabolism and modulation of oxidative stress are also considered in this review. SUMMARY: This update discusses nutritional issues that can be used to help prevent and treat nutrient deficiencies and ameliorate disease activity in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Similar changes in glycosylation occur in the colonic epithelium in inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and also in colon cancer and precancerous adenomatous polyps. They include reduced length of O-glycans, reduced sulfation, increased sialylation and increased expression of oncofetal carbohydrate antigens, such as sialyl-Tn (sialylalpha2-6GalNAc), and the TF antigen (Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen) Galbeta1-3GalNAcalpha-Ser/Thr. The changes affect cell surface as well as secreted glycoproteins and mediate altered interactions between the epithelium and lectins of dietary, microbial or human origin. Different TF-binding lectins cause diverse effects on epithelial cells, reflecting subtle differences in binding specificities e.g. for sialylated TF; some of these interactions, such as with the TF-binding peanut lectin that resists digestion, may be biologically significant. Increased TF expression by cancer cells also allows interaction with the human galactose-binding lectin, galectin-3. This lectin has increased concentration in the sera of patients with metastatic cancer and binds TF on cancer cell surface MUC1 (mucin 1), causing clustering of MUC1 and revealing underlying adhesion molecules which promote adhesion to endothelium. This is likely to be an important mechanism in cancer metastasis and represents a valid therapeutic target. Tools are now available to allow fast and accurate elucidation of glycosylation changes in epithelial disease, characterization of their potential lectin ligands, whether dietary, microbial or human, and determination of the functional significance of their interactions. This should prove a very fruitful area for future research with relevance to infectious, inflammatory and cancerous diseases of the epithelia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Factors initiating human ulcerative colitis (UC) are unknown. Dysbiosis of bacteria has been hypothesized to initiate UC but, to date, neither the nature of the dysbiosis nor mucosal breakdown has been explained. AIM: To assess whether a dysbiosis of anaerobic nitrate respiration could explain the microscopic, biochemical and functional changes observed in colonocytes of UC. METHODS: Published results in the gastroenterological, biochemical and microbiological literature were reviewed concerning colonocytes, nitrate respiration and nitric oxide in the colon in health and UC. A best-fit explanation of results was made regarding the pathogenesis and new treatments of UC. RESULTS: Anaerobic nitrate respiration yields nitrite, nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide. Colonic bacteria produce NO and UC in remission has a higher lumenal NO level than control cases. NO with sulphide, but not NO alone, impairs beta-oxidation, lipid and protein synthesis explaining the membrane, tight junctional and ion channel changes observed in colonocytes of UC. The observations complement therapeutic mechanisms of those probiotics, prebiotics and antibiotics useful in treating UC. CONCLUSIONS: The prolonged production of bacterial NO with sulphide can explain the initiation and barrier breakdown, which is central to the pathogenesis of UC.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) can cause metabolic and inflammatory alterations. AIM: To evaluate the relationships between inflammatory parameters, plasma lipids and phospholipid fatty acid (FA) composition in patients with active UC and CD. METHODS: Diet, the Harvey-Bradshaw Activity Index (HBAI), inflammatory parameters, lipoproteins and FA composition were assessed in 60 CD and 34 UC. RESULTS: No differences in clinical parameters were observed in the two groups. Total cholesterol correlated inversely with the number of bowel movements in both groups and directly with BMI in UC. Arachidonic acid correlated inversely with HBAI in UC and total and HDL cholesterol were inversely related to C-reactive protein (CRP) in CD while HDL correlated with CRP in UC. Docosapentaenoic acid was the only polyunsaturated n-3 FA that was correlated to CRP in both groups. Total cholesterol was independently associated in the multiple regression analysis with the number of bowel movements and systemic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Total and LDL cholesterol were lower in the active UC and CD than in the healthy subjects and were correlated with the systemic inflammatory status. Phospholipid FA composition was correlated to the systemic inflammatory status, but was unrelated to dietary intake and intestinal disease activity.},

   abstract = {The relationship between stress and illness is complex. The susceptibility to stress varies from person to person. Among the factors that influenced the susceptibility to stress are genetic vulnerability, coping style, type of personality and social support. Not all stress has negative effect. Studies have shown that short-term stress boosted the immune system, but chronic stress has a significant effect on the immune system that ultimately manifest an illness. It raises catecholamine and suppressor T cells levels, which suppress the immune system. This suppression, in turn raises the risk of viral infection. Stress also leads to the release of histamine, which can trigger severe broncho-constriction in asthmatics. Stress increases the risk for diabetes mellitus, especially in overweight individuals, since psychological stress alters insulin needs. Stress also alters the acid concentration in the stomach, which can lead to peptic ulcers, stress ulcers or ulcerative colitis. Chronic stress can also lead to plaque buildup in the arteries (atherosclerosis), especially if combined with a high-fat diet and sedentary living. The correlation between stressful life events and psychiatric illness is stronger than the correlation with medical or physical illness. The relationship of stress with psychiatric illness is strongest in neuroses, which is followed by depression and schizophrenia. There is no scientific evidence of a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the immune system changes and the development of cancer. However, recent studies found a link between stress, tumour development and suppression of natural killer (NK) cells, which is actively involved in preventing metastasis and destroying small metastases.},

Fifteen consecutive patients and 15 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Disease activity, diet, inflammatory parameters, plasma lipoprotein concentrations, and fatty acids (FA) of serum phospholipids and of the subcutaneous adipose tissue were assessed at colectomy and at ileostomy closure. In ulcerative colitis patients, total cholesterol and docosahexaenoic acid were lower than in healthy subjects (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05). The median interval between colectomy and ileostomy closure was 6 (range 2-9) months. During that interval, the inflammatory parameters improved, high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol increased (p < 0.01), and low-density (LDL) cholesterol decreased (p = 0.01). At ileostomy closure, serum arachidonic acid levels were increased (p = 0.04), whereas serum oleic acid level was decreased (p = 0.02). In this interval, no significant alteration, either in serum n-3 FA precursors or in the FA of subcutaneous adipose tissue, was observed. The increase of serum arachidonic acid after colectomy might suggest a lower utilization for inflammatory process. The reduction of LDL cholesterol is an index of malabsorption probably due to the accelerated transit and to the exclusion of the terminal ileum caused by the covering ileostomy.},

METHODS: A novel disease-specific questionnaire was used. RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent of patients reported 338 dietary intolerances. Of 225 preoperative dietary intolerances, 151 (67%) resolved/improved, 56 (25%) were unchanged, and 18 (8%) were exacerbated after PC. A total of 113 dietary intolerances developed only after PC. The incidence of specific dietary intolerances in patients 10 years and older post-PC was similar to patients younger than 10 years post-PC except for a lower incidence of caffeinated beverage (P = .01) dietary intolerances 10 years or more post-PC. Intestinal symptoms, bowel function, and activities of daily living largely improved after PC. Extraintestinal UC symptoms worsened or failed to improve in 74%. CONCLUSIONS: PC for UC frequently improves preoperative dietary intolerances. Some patients, however, are at risk for onset of new dietary intolerances after PC. Studies examining traditional symptoms in UC patients pre-PC and post-PC may be enhanced by examining effects on specific dietary intolerances.},

Ecological treatments including probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are actively studied in Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis. We review herein the literature on the rational use of probiotics in IBD considering efficacy (as evaluated in randomized controlled trials), mechanisms of action and safety issues. A probiotic effect is strictly restricted to one defined strain and cannot be generalized from one to another. There is evidence of efficacy of some probiotic drugs in pouchitis (VSL#3), and in the prevention of recurrence of UC (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917). However, the evidence for efficacy of probiotic drugs in CD is still low as well as that of dietary ecological treatments. Despite an ecological (hopefully nutritional) treatment of IBD is promising, many questions remain unanswered and further clinical and fundamental studies are needed.},

   abstract = {The overproduction of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) may play an important role in ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated carcinogenesis. In order to study the role of nitric oxide (NO) in UC-associated colorectal carcinogenesis, the development of colorectal carcinoma was studied using the DSS-induced and iron-enhanced model of chronic UC in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-deficient mice. Female wild-type C57BL/6 (iNOS+/+) and iNOS-/- mice were administered 1% DSS (w/v) through the drinking fluid for 15 DSS cycles and fed twofold iron-enriched diet. Colorectal inflammation and mucosal ulceration of moderate severity were observed in both iNOS+/+ and iNOS-/- mice. Similar tumor incidence and multiplicity in the colon were observed that 15 out of 23 (65.2%) iNOS+/+ mice developed colorectal tumors with a tumor multiplicity of 1.47+/-0.17 (mean+/-SE) after 15 DSS cycles, and 13 out of 19 (68.4%) iNOS-/- mice developed colorectal tumors with a tumor multiplicity of 2.08+/-0.21. Histopathologically, the tumors were confirmed to be well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. Nitrotyrosine, an indicator of peroxynitrite-caused protein modification, was detectable by immunohistochemistry in inflammatory cells and epithelial cells of the colon in iNOS+/+ and iNOS-/- mice, and no difference in staining intensity was observed between the two groups. Immunostaining for endothelial NOS (eNOS) was observed in lamina propria macrophages and colonic blood vessels, and eNOS protein levels were increased in the inflamed colon. These results show that there is no difference in UC-associated cancer development in iNOS+/+ and iNOS-/- mice, and suggest that in the absence of iNOS, other factors, such as eNOS, may play a role in nitrosative stress and UC-associated carcinogenesis in this model system.},

Although the pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) is not fully understood, many suspect that diet and various dietary factors may play a modulating role in the disease process. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The purpose of this article is to present some of what is known about various dietary/nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel disease, with inclusion of evidence from various studies regarding their putative effect. MedLINE was searched (1965-present) using combinations of the following search terms: diet, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Additionally, references of the articles obtained were searched to identify further potential sources of information. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: While much information is available regarding various dietary interventions/supplements in regard to inflammatory bowel disease, the lack of controlled trials limits broad applicability. Probiotics are one of the few interventions with promising results and controlled trials. CONCLUSION: While there are many potential and promising dietary factors that may play a role in the modulation of inflammatory bowel disease, it is prudent to await further controlled studies before broad application/physician recommendation in the noted patient population.},

   abstract = {Diarrhea continues to be a prevalent symptom in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), requiring a wide differential diagnosis to define the pathophysiologic mechanisms in individual patients. It is essential that physicians properly evaluate complaints of diarrhea by assessing both patient symptoms and potential physiologic impacts on fluid and electrolyte status. Underlying mechanisms of diarrhea with IBD are the location, extent, and severity of inflammation; malabsorption; altered motility; and iatrogenic causes such as medications, diet, and antibiotic-associated colitis (eg, Clostridium difficile). When treating diarrhea, physicians need to control inflammatory activity using appropriate treatment algorithms. Therapies include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immune modifiers, and, most recently, biologic treatment. Other medications, including loperamide, diphenoxylate, codeine sulfate, and tinctures of opium, slow motility and increase the absorption of fluids and nutrients. For iatrogenic issues, medications that cause diarrhea should be withdrawn and individual diets modified. Not all diarrheas in the IBD patient are the same; therefore, it is essential to tailor therapies according to presumed etiologies. Antidiarrheal agents are not recommended in extremely ill patients and those with known hypersensitivity or evidence of obstruction or colonic dilation, fever, or abdominal tenderness. Concomitant use of loperamide with diphenoxylate and atropine should be avoided in early pregnancy.},

The aim of this study was to examine the contribution of prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) to mucosal secretion in intestines with UC and to evaluate the effect of dietary n-3 PUFAs on diarrhea in UC. METHODS: We measured the short-circuit current (Isc), using the Ussing chamber method, and fatty acid composition in the colonic mucosa of rats with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis. The DSS-treated rats were fed either a perilla oil-enriched diet (perilla group) or a soybean oil-enriched diet (soybean group); a control group did not undergo DSS administration. RESULTS: The bradykinin-stimulated DeltaIsc in the soybean and perilla groups was significantly higher than that in the control group. The mucosal level of arachidonic acid in the perilla group was significantly lower than that in the soybean group. The mucosal levels of alpha-linolenic acid and EPA in the perilla group were significantly higher than those in the soybean group. The bradykinin-stimulated DeltaIsc was significantly suppressed after pretreatment with indomethacin in both the soybean and perilla groups, and was also significantly reduced in both groups after pretreatment with AA861. The suppression of bradykinin-stimulated DeltaIsc by the addition of AA861 was significantly higher in the perilla group than in the soybean group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid, in combination with a lipoxygenase inhibitor, could suppress the increase in Cl- secretion in patients with UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation (CI) is commonly found in the anal transition zone (ATZ) after stapled ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis (UC). Yet, its impact on defecatory function and the need for a complete mucosectomy has not been completely elucidated. This study aims to evaluate the long-term functional outcomes of patients with CI of the ATZ after stapled IPAA in comparison with mucosectomy patients. METHODS: Between June 1987 and November 2007, 66 UC patients were found to have CI of the ATZ after stapled IPAA and were compared with 228 UC patients who underwent mucosectomy with hand-sewn (HS) IPAA. Patients were mailed a questionnaire to assess defecatory function and quality of life. Data were analyzed prospectively. RESULTS: No differences were observed in age, sex, number, or consistency of bowel movements (BMs) between groups. Complete continence was reported by 90.3% of CI and 66.8% of HS patients (P < .001). The CI group also had a significantly lower rate of major incontinence (P < .001). Functional parameters in favor of the CI group included the ability to discriminate between gas and stool (P < .001), the use of protective pads during both the day and the night (P < .001), dietary modifications in the timing of meals (P < .001) and type of food (P = .005), and the presence of perianal rash (P = .019). In the CI group, more patients rated their quality of life as improved from before the operation (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Preservation of the ATZ, even in presence of persistent inflammation, confers improved continence, better functional outcomes, and superior quality of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Respiratory symptoms are over-represented in inflammatory bowel disease. There are similarities between the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease and that of respiratory conditions for which an adverse influence of salicylate has been identified. Natural salicylates exist within our diet. AIMS: To determine whether a lower intake of dietary salicylates is associated with less active inflammatory bowel disease and fewer concurrent respiratory symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Respiratory status, inflammatory bowel disease activity, quality of life, and dietary habits were established in 73 patients with Crohn's disease and 69 with ulcerative colitis, using a self-administered questionnaire and peak expiratory flow rate readings. Harvey-Bradshaw and Simple Birmingham/Royal Free Colitis indices, an internally validated respiratory score, and estimated weekly dietary salicylate intake, were calculated for each patient. RESULTS: There was at least one respiratory symptom in 63.4% of patients. The commonest underlying respiratory diagnosis was asthma. Respiratory impairment was similar in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; 56.3% of Crohn's disease patients with an active respiratory diagnosis had other extra-intestinal manifestations. The dietary salicylate intake was independent of respiratory status, but inversely correlated with ulcerative colitis activity (dietary salicylate intake 37.0mg versus 21.4mg for low and higher Simple Birmingham/Royal Free Colitis index, respectively; p<0.02). A similar association was not seen in Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory impairment is common in inflammatory bowel disease. Higher intake of dietary salicylates is associated with less active colitis and possibly causally so.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There is no clear evidence that dietary proteins aggravate Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to clarify the antibody response to dietary proteins in CD. METHODS: Antibody to porcine pancreatic amylase (PPA) a protease-resistant dietary protein (anti-PPA), was examined in CD patients (N = 104), ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (N = 85), and healthy controls (N = 83), and its relationship with the clinical characteristics of CD was investigated. Antibodies to casein and ovalbumin, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), and antibodies to I2 from Pseudomonas fluorescens (anti-I2) were also examined. RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent (39/104) of the CD patients expressed anti-PPA antibodies, and this percentage was significantly higher as compared with the control group (5%, 4/83) and the UC group (9%, 8/85) (P < 0.001). A significantly higher level of anti-PPA antibodies was detected in patients with "small bowel disease-dominant" CD than in those with "colitis-dominant" CD (P < 0.05). Antibodies to casein and ovalbumin were not specifically expressed in CD patients. As ASCA was detected in 33% and anti-I2 in 46% of the CD patients, 72% of the CD patients were found positive for at least one of the three antibodies including anti-PPA antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients showed a specific antibody response to PPA, as compared with UC patients and controls. There was a significantly higher level of anti-PPA antibody in patients with "small bowel disease-dominant" CD, suggesting that dietary proteins could play a role in the inflammatory response in CD patients with small bowel disease. Anti-PPA antibodies combined with ASCA/anti-I2 may be useful for the diagnosis of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) it is not known whether reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) are a consequence of bone turnover alterations and if BMD improves with treatment. METHODS: In a cohort of children with IBD, we prospectively measured indicators of bone remodeling, body mass index (BMI), disease activity, intact parathyroid hormone, serum IL-6, and insulin-like growth factor-I at diagnosis and then every 6 months for 2 years. BMD was determined annually using dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). BMD Z-scores were calculated using height/age. Baseline measurements and calcium intake were compared with a group of age- and sex-matched healthy children. RESULTS: We observed that at diagnosis total body BMD Z-score (mean +/- SD) was -0.78 +/- 1.02 for Crohn's disease (CD, n = 58), -0.46 +/- 1.14 for ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 18), and -0.17 +/- 0.95 for control (CL, n = 49) (P < 0.01, CD versus CL). In CD, a BMD Z-score <-1.0 was associated with lower BMI and higher serum IL-6. Patients with CD and UC had low bone turnover. Activation of bone formation paralleled clinical improvement, but BMC gain was less than expected over the 2-year study period, especially in CD. Prednisone use did not correlate with low BMD. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased bone turnover occurs in children newly diagnosed with IBD. Although indicators of osteoblast activity increase with clinical improvement, bone mineral accrual does not accelerate. Children with low BMI may be considered for BMD screening, since they are at risk for low bone mass.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this pilot study (N=26) was to investigate dietary intake and body composition and problems associated with dietary intake (such as unnecessary dietary restriction) in Japanese patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. Findings revealed the macronutrient intake and dietary fiber (absolute amount) were lower than the national average in men, but this may have been due to differences in the methods used to measure dietary intake. Although the fat intake (%E) of ulcerative colitis patients in this study was similar to that of the Japanese population, it differed greatly from that of people in Western countries. No significant differences in weight, height, or body mass index were found when comparing the sample of individuals living with ulcerative colitis with the general Japanese population. Seventeen patients (65.4%) reported being cautious about what they ate even though in remission, and 6 patients were even more cautious about what they ate now than they had been in the past. The authors suggest further research to clarify the problems that unnecessary dietary restriction cause for ulcerative colitis patients who are in remission.},

   abstract = {Ramadan fasting may induce changes in gastrointestinal physiology. The effect of this fasting on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is not known. We conducted a cohort study in the month of Ramadan in 2006 to assess the effect of Ramadan fasting on IBD. Sixty patients with IBD, who were in remission and undertook fasting according to their own free will underwent assessment of quality-of-life (QoL) parameters, psychological state and the severity of symptoms before and after Ramadan. There was no correlation between the number of fasting days and the severity of the disease, QoL and psychological state of the patients. QoL did not change after Ramadan. Younger patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) fasted for a greater number of days (p=0.01) compared to older patients. The mean score of anxiety, using a modified version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was 12.7 (6.0) before Ramadan in women with UC, and decreased to 9.8 (4.4) afterfasting (p=0.026). Men with UC had a mean score of colitis activity index of 3.5 before Ramadan, which decreased to 1.7 after fasting (p=0.008). It appears that Ramadan fasting does not impose serious risks on patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), is a disorder characterized by diffuse inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The immune response and inflammation are mediated by polyunsaturated fatty acids and influenced by dietary fats and lipid metabolism. This study examined the qualitative and quantitative fat intake of IBD patients and healthy controls on plasma phospholipid and erythrocyte membrane phospholipid (EMP) fatty acid content. Measurement of the fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipid and EMP were performed in 29 UC patients, 20 CD patients, and 31 healthy controls. Anthropometric characteristics and data on dietary intake were also collected. We observed significantly lower lipid intake in UC and CD patients vs controls. The UC and CD patients had significantly higher levels of linoleic acid in their EMP than did controls. There were no significant differences in the levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but there were significantly higher levels of the n-6 in the EMP of UC and CD patients compared with controls. The significant differences persisted after the data were adjusted for potential confounders and lipid intake. Higher levels of linoleic acids and n-6 fatty acids, which are involved in production of proinflammatory mediators, were found in IBD patients compared with controls, thereby implicating n-6 fatty acids in the pathophysiology of the disease.},
