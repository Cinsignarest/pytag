   abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) plays a pivotal role in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Although anti-TNF antibody therapy is now commonly used to treat patients suffering from these inflammatory conditions, the cost of treatment continues to be a concern. Here, we developed a rice transgenic system for the production of a llama variable domain of a heavy-chain antibody fragment (VHH) specific for mouse TNF in rice seeds (MucoRice-mTNF-VHH). MucoRice-mTNF-VHH was produced at high levels in the rice seeds when we used our most recent transgene-overexpression system with RNA interference technology that suppresses the production of major rice endogenous storage proteins while enhancing the expression of the transgene-derived protein. Production levels of mTNF-VHH in rice seeds reached an average of 1.45% (w/w). Further, approximately 91% of mTNF-VHH was released easily when the powder form of MucoRice-mTNF-VHH was mixed with PBS. mTNF-VHH purified by means of single-step gel filtration from rice PBS extract showed high neutralizing activity in an in vitro mTNF cytotoxicity assay using WEHI164 cells. In addition, purified mTNF-VHH suppressed progression of collagen-induced arthritis in mice. These results show that this rice-expression system is useful for the production of neutralizing VHH antibody specific for mTNF.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the spectrum of colonic microflora in patients with colitis and if this could be altered with one month's treatment with synbiotics. METHODS: This was a pilot study in which patients were randomised to either receive a synbiotics preparation for a month and then "crossed over" to receive a placebo, or alternatively to receive the placebo first followed in the second month by synbiotic. Stool samples were collected on entry into the study and then at the end of first and second months respectively. Colonic microflora was measured by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the concentration of individual species. RESULTS: Sixteen patients completed the study of whom 8 had Crohn's colitis and 8 had ulcerative colitis. Their median age was 62 (IQR 50-65) years. An average of 22 terminal restriction fragments (T-RF's) was identified in each patient. Dice cluster analysis showed that each patient had a unique microbial composition which did not change significantly at different time points in the study, irrespective of whether they had probiotics or the placebo. Probiotic organisms were identified in stool samples but did not alter overall spectrum of microflora. In this pilot study we were unable to identify any specific characteristics related to nature of colitis. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that there is no difference in colonic microflora between patients with Crohn's or Ulcerative colitis and that the spectrum of bacteria was not altered by synbiotic administration.},

As of 2013, there were 3 additional tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists commercially available for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in the United States: adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab. Despite a vast literature describing both clinical trial and clinical practice experience with these agents, there remain important questions regarding the efficacy and safety of tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. These questions and the best available evidence to answer them were discussed during a Cochrane Collaboration session held at the 2013 Digestive Diseases Week annual meeting. This article reviews the data from that session.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are 2 common inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) associated with intestinal inflammation and tissue damage. Oxidative stress is suggested to play a major role in the initiation and progression of IBD. Vitamin C (ascorbate, ascorbic acid) supplementation has reduced oxidative stress in persons with IBD. The role of ascorbate transporters in IBD remains to be determined. SLC23A1 is a major ascorbate transporter in the intestinal tract, and some of its genetic variants have been associated with severely decreased ascorbate transport and lower systemic concentrations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether common genetic variants in the vitamin C transporter SLC23A1 are associated with the risk of IBD. DESIGN: Genomic DNA samples from patients with CD (n = 162) and UC (n = 149) from the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study and ethnically matched controls (n = 142) were genotyped for 3 SLC23A1 polymorphisms (rs6596473, rs33972313, and rs10063949) by using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Variation at rs10063949 (G allele for heterozygote and homozygote) was associated with increased susceptibility to CD (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.38, 4.66; OR: 4.72; 95% CI: 2.53, 8.81; P < 0.0001; respectively). A strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed across the SLC23A1 region (variation rs6596473 with rs10063949) for CD and UC (D' = 0.94 and 0.96, respectively). The risk alleles confirmed a haplotype (CGG) that is carried more in CD patients (65.3%, P < 0.0001) than in controls (43.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A genetic variant (rs10063949-G) in the SLC23A1 ascorbate transporter locus was identified and is associated with an increased risk of CD in a white Canadian IBD cohort. The presented evidence that SLC23A1 variations can modulate the risk of CD has implications for understanding ascorbate transport in CD patients and provides a novel opportunity toward individualized nutritional therapy for patients carrying the disease-associated genotype.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Dietary fats influence intestinal inflammation and regulate mucosal immunity. Data on the association between dietary fat and risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are limited and conflicting. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study cohorts. Diet was prospectively ascertained every 4 years using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Self-reported CD and UC were confirmed through medical record review. We examined the effect of energy-adjusted cumulative average total fat intake and specific types of fat and fatty acids on the risk of CD and UC using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 170,805 women, we confirmed 269 incident cases of CD (incidence 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 incident cases of UC (incidence 10/100,000 person-years) over 26 years and 3,317,338 person-years of follow-up. Cumulative energy-adjusted intake of total fat, saturated fats, unsaturated fats, n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were not associated with risk of CD or UC. However, greater intake of long-chain n-3 PUFAs was associated with a trend towards lower risk of UC (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01). In contrast, high long-term intake of trans-unsaturated fatty acids was associated with a trend towards an increased incidence of UC (HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.92). CONCLUSIONS: A high intake of dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs may be associated with a reduced risk of UC. In contrast, high intake of trans-unsaturated fats may be associated with an increased risk of UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Increased intake of dietary fiber has been proposed to reduce the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]). However, few prospective studies have examined associations between long-term intake of dietary fiber and risk of incident CD or UC. METHODS: We collected and analyzed data from 170,776 women, followed up over 26 years, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, followed up for 3,317,425 person-years. Dietary information was prospectively ascertained via administration of a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire every 4 years. Self-reported CD and UC were confirmed through review of medical records. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for potential confounders, were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: We confirmed 269 incident cases of CD (incidence, 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 cases of UC (incidence, 10/100,000 person-years). Compared with the lowest quintile of energy-adjusted cumulative average intake of dietary fiber, intake of the highest quintile (median of 24.3 g/day) was associated with a 40% reduction in risk of CD (multivariate HR for CD, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.90). This apparent reduction appeared to be greatest for fiber derived from fruits; fiber from cereals, whole grains, or legumes did not modify risk. In contrast, neither total intake of dietary fiber (multivariate HR, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.17) nor intake of fiber from specific sources appeared to be significantly associated with risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: Based on data from the Nurses' Health Study, long-term intake of dietary fiber, particularly from fruit, is associated with lower risk of CD but not UC. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms that mediate this association.},

   abstract = {Clinical trials are reviewed, involving proteins and peptides derived from milk (predominantly bovine), with the exception of lactoferrin, which will be the subject of another article. The most explored milk fraction is alpha-lactalbumin (LA), which is often applied with glycomacropeptide (GMP) - a casein degradation product. These milk constituents are used in health-promoting infant and adult formulae as well as in a modified form (HAMLET) to treat cancer. Lactoperoxidase (LCP) is used as an additive to mouth hygiene products and as a salivary substitute. Casein derivatives are applied, in addition, in the dry mouth syndrome. On the other hand, casein hydrolysates, containing active tripeptides, found application in hypertension and in type 2 diabetes. Lysozyme is routinely used for food conservation and in pharmaceutical products. It was successfully used in premature infants with concomitant diseases to improve health parameters. When used as prophylaxis in patients with scheduled surgery, it significantly reduced the incidence of hepatitis resulting from blood transfusion. Lysozyme was also used in infected children as an antimicrobial agent showing synergistic effects in combination with different antibiotics. Proline-rich polypeptide (PRP) was introduced to therapy of Alzheimer's disease patients. The therapeutic value of PRP was proved in several clinical trials and supported by studies on its mechanism of action. Concentrated immunoglobulin preparations from colostrum and milk of hyperimmunized cows showed efficacy in prevention of infections by bacteria, viruses and protozoa. A nutrition formula with milk-derived TGF-beta2 (Modulen IBD(R)) found application in treatment of pediatric Crohn's disease. In conclusion, the preparations containing milk-derived products are safe and effective measures in prevention and treatment of infections as well as autoimmune and neoplastic diseases.},

JD is one of the most widespread bacterial diseases of domestic animals with significant economic impact. The histopathological picture of JD resembles that of Crohn's disease (CD), a human chronic inflammatory bowel disease of still unresolved aetiology. An aetiological relevance of MAP for CD has been proposed. This and the ambiguity of other published epidemiological findings raise the question whether MAP represents a zoonotic agent.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) is common in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. This paper reports on the prevalence of decreased BMD in a referral cohort study of CD-patients next to the change of BMD over time in relation with CD-associated clinical characteristics. METHODS: 205 CD patients of a referral hospital were enrolled between January1998-January 2010 when measurement of BMD by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was available. Follow-up DXA scan was performed in subjects with known risk factors besides Crohn indicative for low BMD. Treatment of CD patients was according to a protocol which is comparable to the current (inter)national guidelines. In osteopenic patients, supplemental vitamin D (800 IU) and Calcium (500-1000 mg) were prescribed. RESULTS: Mean BMD at baseline was 0.97 +/- 0.16 gram/cm(2) in lumbar spine and 0.87 +/- 0.12 gram/cm(2) in the total hip. At baseline, higher age and low Body Mass Index (BMI), were negatively correlated with BMD. Eighty-four patients underwent a second BMD assessment with a median interval period of 4 years (IQR 3-6). A mean annual increase of +0.76% (95%CI: -2.63%; +3.87%) in lumbar spine and +0.43% (95%CI: -2.65% ; +1.11%) in total hip was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Higher age, male sex, low BMI, and a higher age at diagnosis of CD were associated with low BMD. Follow-up of BMD in CD patients showed a contraintuitive small increase of BMD at lumbar spine and total hip in CD patients only using supplemental vitamin D and calcium next to strict treatment of CD.},

Several families of molecules regulate the influx of these cells into sites of inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract. Pharmacological blockade of interactions between molecules that mediate the formation of stable bonds (integrins) and their endothelial ligands has already shown clinical efficacy. Antibodies that target participant molecules have been approved by the US Federal Drug Administration for use in Crohn's, multiple sclerosis (MS) (i.e. natalizumab) and psoriasis (i.e. efalizumab). A more recent additional family of drugs, which might also interfere with lymphocyte traffic (i.e. sphingosine-1- phosphate receptor agonists: fingolimod) is in clinical use for MS and just recently entered the clinical trial stage for ulcerative colitis. In the present review we discuss basic aspects of clinically relevant molecules and compile the clinical studies that support the targeting of specific steps of the leukocyte adhesion cascade for therapeutic purposes in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low serum vitamin D levels may provoke or aggravate Crohn's disease (CrD). Vitamin D3 is a well-known immune modulator that affects immune functions in vitro and may prevent CrD flares. Dendritic cells (DC) are key mediators of vitamin D3 effects. In this study, we describe changes in monocyte-derived DC (mo-DC) maturation marker expression and cytokine production following 26 weeks of oral vitamin D3 supplementation in CrD patients. METHODS: Ten CrD patients who had increased serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels after oral vitamin D3 and calcium treatment and ten seasonally matched placebo-treated patients were selected for this study. Mo-DC were generated before and after the 26 weeks and induced to mature upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Maturation marker expression and cytokine production were analysed. Mo-DC function was analysed in a mixed leucocyte reaction (MLR). RESULTS: Compared with baseline values, LPS-matured mo-DC exhibited reduced expression of CD80 and reduced production of the cytokines IL-10, IL-1beta, and IL-6 following 26 weeks of oral vitamin D3 supplementation. Mo-DC performance in an allogeneic MLR was unchanged after vitamin D3 supplementation. Treatment with the placebo did not affect maturation markers, cytokine production, or the MLR. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D3 treatment in CrD patients led to hypo-responsive LPS-stimulated mo-DC. This finding indicates that vitamin D3 levels have an impact on the monocytic precursors of mo-DC in vivo and may explain the positive effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on CrD patients. Alternatively, CrD patients with high serum vitamin D3 levels may represent a subgroup with low disease activity.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized as a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Current consensus surrounding the cause of the disease suggests a complex interplay between genetic susceptibility, the intestinal microbiome and environmental factors, leading to the aberrant Th1 and Th17 immune cell mediated response. Vitamin D deficiency is common in CD patients, and long-standing deficiency has been associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD). Accumulating evidence now suggests that in addition to maintaining skeletal integrity, vitamin D also plays an integral role in regulating the general immune response, a function employed via its genomic actions on the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The VDR is expressed in all immune cells and both directly and indirectly targeted by the bioactive form of vitamin D, 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D). Impaired regulation or deficiency of the vitamin has been linked to the promotion of self-reactive T cell development, loss of immune tolerance to self-structures, and experimental colitis in animal models, whereas the subsequent administration of the vitamin in these models resulted in the improvement of immune-mediated symptoms. In addition, low vitamin D has been associated with disease activity in CD patients, and supplementation appears to be beneficial in improving clinical scores and reducing inflammation. Therefore, the primary aims of this article were to review the molecular evidence supporting the immunoregulatory roles of vitamin D and its supplementation in the CD patient, based on existing literature. The physiological processes, accepted serum concentration values, and its well-recognized role in bone health were also summarized.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental factors during childhood are thought to play a role in the aetiolgy of Crohn's Disease (CD). However the association between age at time of exposure and the subsequent development of CD in South Africa is unknown. METHODS: A case control study of all consecutive CD patients seen at 2 large inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) referral centers in the Western Cape, South Africa between September 2011 and January 2013 was performed. Numerous environmental exposures during 3 age intervals; 0-5, 6-10 and 11-18 years were extracted using an investigator administered questionnaire. An agreement analysis was performed to determine the reliability of questionnaire data for all the relevant variables. RESULTS: This study included 194 CD patients and 213 controls. On multiple logistic regression analysis, a number of childhood environmental exposures during the 3 age interval were significantly associated with the risk of developing CD. During the age interval 6-10 years, never having had consumed unpasteurized milk (OR = 5.84; 95% CI, 2.73-13.53) and never having a donkey, horse, sheep or cow on the property (OR = 2.48; 95% CI, 1.09-5.98) significantly increased the risk of developing future CD. During the age interval 11-18 years, an independent risk-association was identified for; never having consumed unpasteurized milk (OR = 2.60; 95% CI, 1.17-6.10) and second-hand cigarette smoke exposure (OR = 1.93; 95% CI, 1.13-3.35). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that both limited microbial exposures and exposure to second-hand cigarette smoke during childhood is associated with future development of CD.},

   abstract = {Microparticles are small (<1 microm), nonbiological particles that are used in many areas of daily life. As food additive they are used as anticaking agents or food colorants. The most common food-derived ingested compounds are aluminium silicate and titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), the latter being a white pigment used in toothpaste or sugar toppings. The increasing abundance of microparticles in the Western diet raises the question of the potential risks associated with gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease (CD). Accumulation of particles has been shown in cells of Peyer's patches, but it is not clear whether this also has pathological effects. NLRP3 is a member of the intracellular pattern recognition receptor family and it is part of the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex containing caspase-1 which activates the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18. With regard to recent findings identifying small particles such as asbestos and monosodium urate as NLRP3 activators, TiO(2) may be another potential target for inflammasome studies. We found that macrophage-like cells readily take up TiO(2) after 6 h. Incubation of cells with TiO(2) resulted in the assembly of NLRP3 with caspase-1. This inflammasome assembly correlated with secretion of IL-1beta. In intestinal epithelial cells, TiO(2) also was found to be ingested. The counting of particles localized intracellularly revealed a dose-dependent increase of TiO(2)-positive cells. This points to the fact that in humans with a leaky intestinal barrier (such as IBD patients), TiO(2) microparticles may be taken up by macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells, may activate the inflammasome and induce IL-1beta and IL-18 secretion. This may aggravate inflammation in susceptible individuals.},

   abstract = {The dysbiosis theory of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) posits that there is an alteration in the gut microbiome as an important underpinning of disease etiology. It stands to reason then, that administering agents that could impact on the balance of microbes on the gut could be impactful on the course of IBD. Herein is a review of the controlled trials undertaken to assess the use of antibiotics that would kill or suppress potentially injurious microbes, probiotics that would overpopulate the gut with potentially beneficial microbes or prebiotics that provide a metabolic substrate that enhances the growth of potentially beneficial microbes. With regard to antibiotics, the best data are for the use of nitroimadoles postoperatively in Crohn's disease (CD) to prevent disease recurrence. Otherwise, the data are limited with the regard to any lasting benefit of antibiotics sustaining remission in either CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). A recent meta-analysis concluded that antibiotics are superior to placebo at inducing remission in CD or UC, although the meta-analysis grouped a variety of antibiotics with different spectra of activity. Despite the absence of robust clinical trial data, antibiotics are widely used to treat perineal fistulizing CD and acute and chronic pouchitis. Probiotics have not been shown to have a beneficial role in CD. However, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 has comparable effects to low doses of mesalamine in maintaining remission in UC. VSL#3, a combination of 8 microbes, has been shown to have an effect in inducing remission in UC and preventing pouchitis. Prebiotics have yet to be shown to have an effect in any form of IBD, but to date controlled trials have been small. The use of antibiotics should be balanced against the risks they pose. Even probiotics may pose some risk and should not be assumed to be innocuous especially when ingested by persons with a compromised epithelial barrier. Prebiotics may not be harmful but may cause gastrointestinal side effects. Finally, the timing of ingestion of antibiotics and other dietary factors that may function as prebiotics, especially in early childhood, may be critical in shaping the gut microbiome and ultimately predisposing to or preventing IBD. Finding ways to impact on the gut microbiome to alter the course of IBD makes good sense, but should be undertaken in the setting of rigorously performed controlled trials to ensure that the interventions are truly effective and well tolerated.},

   abstract = {The intestinal mucosa interfaces with a complex, dense community of microorganisms, including hundreds of species of resident microbiota and many transient microbes entering from food- and water-borne sources. In the small intestine, Paneth cells (specialized secretory epithelial cells) produce abundant quantities of alpha-defensins and several other antibiotic peptides. Human Paneth cells make two alpha-defensins: HD5 and HD6. Data from in vivo models indicate that Paneth cell alpha-defensins play a pivotal role in defense from food- and water-borne pathogens in the intestine. The mechanism by which these two alpha-defensins protect from enteric pathogens is quite distinct. HD5 is a potent antimicrobial that kills target microbes by membrane disruption, whereas HD6 is newly discovered to self-assemble to form fibrils and nanonets that surround and entangle bacteria. Recent data suggest that HD5 also serves to help shape the composition of the colonizing microbiota. Studies in humans suggest that reduced expression of HD5 and HD6 is a fundamental feature of ileal Crohn's disease. Mechanistically, the link between reduced Paneth cell alpha-defensin expression and ileal Crohn's disease pathogenesis may be a result of the weakened mucosal antimicrobial defense and/or alterations in the composition of commensal microbiota.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been a dramatic increase in investigations on the potential mechanistic role of the intestinal microbiota in various diseases and factors modulating intestinal microbial composition. We recently reported on intestinal microbial shifts after smoking cessation in humans. In this study, we aimed to conduct further microbial analyses and verify our previous results obtained by pyrosequencing using a direct quantitative microbial approach. METHODS: Stool samples of healthy smoking human subjects undergoing controlled smoking cessation during a 9-week observational period were analyzed and compared with 2 control groups, ongoing smoking and nonsmoking subjects. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was applied to quantify specific bacterial groups. RESULTS: Intestinal microbiota composition was substantially altered after smoking cessation as characterized by an increase in key representatives from the phyla of Firmicutes (Clostridium coccoides, Eubacterium rectale, and Clostridium leptum subgroup) and Actinobacteria (HGC bacteria and Bifidobacteria) as well as a decrease in Bacteroidetes (Prevotella spp. and Bacteroides spp.) and Proteobacteria (beta- and gamma-subgroup of Proteobacteria). CONCLUSIONS: As determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, an independent direct quantitative microbial approach, we could confirm that intestinal microbiota composition in humans is influenced by smoking. The characteristics of observed microbial shifts suggest a potential mechanistic association to alterations in body weight subsequent to smoking cessation. More importantly, regarding previously described microbial hallmarks of dysbiosis in inflammatory bowel diseases, a variety of observed microbial alterations after smoking cessation deserve further consideration in view of the divergent effect of smoking on the clinical course of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.},

Anthocyanins, highly abundant in bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus), were shown to have antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. We aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of bilberries in active UC. METHODS: In an open pilot trial with a total follow-up of 9 weeks the effect of a daily standardized anthocyanin-rich bilberry preparation was tested in 13 patients with mild to moderate UC. Clinical, biochemical, endoscopic and histologic parameters were assessed. RESULTS: At the end of the 6 week treatment interval 63.4% of patients achieved remission, the primary endpoint, while 90.9% of patients showed a response. In all patients a decrease in total Mayo score was detected (mean: 6.5 and 3.6 at screening and week 7, respectively; p<0.001). Fecal calprotectin levels significantly decreased during the treatment phase (baseline: mean 778 mug/g, range 192-1790 mug/g; end of treatment: mean 305 mug/g, range <30-1586 mug/g; p=0.049), including 4 patients achieving undetectable levels at end of treatment. A decrease in endoscopic Mayo score and histologic Riley index confirmed the beneficial effect. However, an increase of calprotectin levels and disease activity was observed after cessation of bilberry intake. No serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the promising therapeutic potential of a standardized anthocyanin-rich bilberry preparation in UC in humans. These results clearly indicate a therapeutic potential of bilberries in UC. Further studies on mechanisms and randomized clinical trials are warranted.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The currently available medications for treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, antibiotics, immunomodulators and biologic agents (infliximab, certolizumab pegol, adalimumab and natalizumab). These agents target the immune and inflammatory pathways of CD, while there is a shortage of agents that target the barrier functions of the gut that are impaired in CD. Glucagon-like peptide 2 is an enterogastrone with strong trophic effects on the intestinal mucosa. Teduglutide , the analog of glucagon-like peptide has been already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a treatment of short bowel syndrome. This review discusses the potential use of teduglutide in patients with CD. AREAS COVERED: As there has been only one randomized placebo controlled trial of teduglutide in CD, there is a shortage of data regarding the efficacy of this agent in CD. The literature search was performed using Medline database with the use of the following key words: teduglutide, glucagon-like peptide-2, CD and inflammatory bowel disease. EXPERT OPINION: Based on available data, it can be concluded that this agent seems to be a promising medication in CD and further trials are required to define the place of teduglutide in treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is one of the five most prevalent gastrointestinal disease burdens in the US, with an overall health care cost of more than USD 1.7 billion. It commonly requires a lifetime of care, and accounts for more than 700,000 physician visits, 100,000 hospitalizations, and disability in 119,000 patients each year. IBD is a multifactorial disease and comprises genetic susceptibility, uncontrolled immune responses, and environmental factors which play a role in the pathogenesis and course of the disease. IBD patients are lifelong on medication, either for induction or maintenance therapy. Current treatment option (corticosteroids, immune suppressants, biologics), administered in mono- or combination therapy, are still unsatisfactory. Due to the nature of disease, 20-40% of patients relapse within the first 12 months. Although modern treatment algorithms have diminished the risk of surgery, the treatments harbor significant side effects, which impacts patients' quality of life. The role of nutrition in IBD has gathered high interest, especially in pediatric Crohn's disease, where studies have shown that exclusive enteral nutrition can induce remission in mild-to-moderate disease comparable to corticosteroids. Thus, gastroenterologists and patients become increasingly aware that specific nutritional interventions offered in addition to the standard of care are an appealing option for a safe long-term disease management. Such specific nutritional solutions should be based on scientific/clinical evidence and specifically designed to address the patients' distinct nutritional requirements. As per definition, these nutrition products fall under the regulatory framework of a Medical Food (Foods for Special Medical Purposes in Europe).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Monitoring of mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is of major importance. New noninvasive markers for intestinal inflammation are needed. Previous studies have reported that pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) correlates with clinical activity in IBD subgroups. Our aim was to investigate the correlation of serum and fecal PAP with clinical and biochemical parameters of disease activity in a real-life IBD cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and five consecutive IBD patients were enrolled. Clinical disease activity was scored by the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index; also, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and fecal calprotectin were determined. As surrogate for endoscopy, a combination score of clinical indices with CRP or calprotectin was used to define active disease. Fecal and serum PAP were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: The median serum and fecal PAP did not differ in Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with active compared with inactive disease according to clinical activity indices. Defining active disease by a combination score of Harvey-Bradshaw Index of more than 4 and CRP of more than 5 mg/l or calprotectin more than 250 microg/g, serum PAP (P=0.01), but not fecal PAP (P=0.32), was significantly higher in active than inactive CD patients. Area under the curve of the corresponding receiver operating curve (ROC) was 0.64. No differences were found in serum or fecal PAP levels using the combination score for active disease in UC. CONCLUSION: Serum but not fecal PAP was higher in active compared with nonactive CD and may reflect mucosal inflammation in CD, but not in UC. However, the accuracy of serum PAP for the diagnosis of active disease was poor, and therefore, serum PAP does not seem to have additional value compared with the current noninvasive markers.},

   abstract = {Gut microbiota is more and more important since metagenomic research have brought new knowledge on this topic especially for human health. Firstly, gut microbiota is a key element for our organism he lives in symbiosis with. Secondly, it interacts favorably with many physiological functions of our organism. Thirdly, at the opposite, it can be an active participant in intestinal pathologies linked to a dysbiosis mainly in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis but also in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and more prudently in autism and behavioral disorders. In order to keep a good health, it is essential to protect our gut microbiota as soon as our young age and maintain it healthy. Face to a more and more important number of publications for treating certain digestive diseases with fecal microbial transplantation, it needs to be very careful and recommend further studies in order to assess risks and define standardized protocols. Gut microbiota metabolic capacities towards xenobiotics need to be developed, and we must take an interest in the modifications they induce on medicinal molecules. On the other hand, it is essential to study the potent effects of pesticides and other pollutants on microbiota functions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Saccharomyces boulardii is a probiotic yeast that has been shown to have beneficial effects on the intestinal epithelial barrier and digestive immune system. There is preliminary evidence that S boulardii could be used to treat patients with Crohn's disease (CD). We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of S boulardii in patients with CD who underwent remission during therapy with steroids or aminosalicylates. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 165 patients who achieved remission after treatment with steroids or salicylates; they were randomly assigned to groups given S boulardii (1 g/day) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was the percentage of patients in remission at week 52. Time to relapse, Crohn's disease activity index scores, and changes in parameters of inflammation were secondary end points. RESULTS: CD relapsed in 80 patients, 38 in the S boulardii group (47.5%) and 42 in the placebo group (53.2%, a nonsignificant difference). The median time to relapse did not differ significantly between patients given S boulardii (40.7 weeks) vs placebo (39.0 weeks). There were no significant differences between groups in mean Crohn's disease activity index scores or erythrocyte sedimentation rates or in median levels of C-reactive protein. In a post hoc analysis, nonsmokers given S boulardii were less likely to experience a relapse of CD than nonsmokers given placebo, but this finding requires confirmation. CONCLUSIONS: Although the probiotic yeast S boulardii is safe and well tolerated, it does not appear to have any beneficial effects for patients with CD in remission after steroid or salicylate therapies.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Calcium deficiency is considered a risk factor for the development of osteoporosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Various dietary restrictions, including milk products are reported by these patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate dairy product and dietary calcium intake by IBD patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 65 outpatients with IBD recruited from one reference center for IBD. A semi-structured questionnaire (to collect demographic, socioeconomic and clinical data) and a quantitative food frequency questionnaire were administered. With regard to clinical data, we evaluated the anthropometric nutritional status, the disease classification, the disease activity index and the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Self-reported modifications in the use of dairy products were evaluated. RESULTS: The IBD patients' ages ranged from 20-75 years and 67.0% were diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. The majority (64.7%) reported restricting dairy products. The frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms was higher among the Crohn's disease patients who restricted dairy products than among those with no restrictions (100% vs 42.9%; p = 0.013); this result was not observed among the UC (ulcerative colitis) patients. Disease activity was also more frequent in the IBD patients who restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (23.8% vs 4.5%; p = 0.031), and among the UC patients, extensive disease was more common in the patients who restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (42.9% vs 20.0%; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Restricting dairy products is common among IBD patients, possibly due to disease activity, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the extension of the disease.},

   abstract = {Dietary methyl donors and their genetic determinants are associated with Crohn's disease risk. We investigated whether a methyl-deficient diet (MDD) may affect development and functions of the small intestine in rat pups from dams subjected to the MDD during gestation and lactation. At 1 month before pregnancy, adult females were fed with either a standard food or a diet without vitamin B12, folate and choline. A global wall hypotrophy was observed in the distal small bowel (MDD animals 0.30 mm v. controls 0.58 mm; P< 0.001) with increased crypt apoptosis (3.37 v. 0.4%; P< 0.001), loss of enterocyte differentiation in the villus and a reduction in intestinal alkaline phosphatase production. Cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining (MDD animals 3.37% v. controls 0.4%, P< 0.001) and the Apostain labelling index showed increased crypt apoptosis (3.5 v. 1.4%; P= 0.018). Decreased proliferation was observed in crypts of the proximal small bowel with a reduced number of minichromosome maintenance 6 (MDD animals 52.83% v. controls 83.17%; P= 0.048) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells (46.25 v. 59 %; P= 0.05). This lack of enterocyte differentiation in the distal small bowel was associated with an impaired expression of beta-catenin and a decreased beta-catenin-E-cadherin interaction. The MDD affected the intestinal barrier in the proximal small bowel by decreasing Paneth cell number after immunostaining for lysosyme (MDD animals 8.66% v. controls 21.66%) and by reducing goblet cell number and mucus production after immunostaining for mucin-2 (crypts 8.66 v. 15.33%; villus 7 v. 17%). The MDD has dual effects on the small intestine by producing dramatic effects on enterocyte differentiation and barrier function in rats.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), namely Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are lifelong chronic disorders arising from interactions among genetic, immunological and environmental factors. Although the origin of IBDs is closely linked to immune response alterations, which governs most medical decision-making, recent findings suggest that gut microbiota may be involved in IBD pathogenesis. Epidemiologic evidence and several studies have shown that a dysregulation of gut microbiota (i.e., dysbiosis) may trigger the onset of intestinal disorders such as IBDs. Animal and human investigations focusing on the microbiota-IBD relationship have suggested an altered balance of the intestinal microbial population in the active phase of IBD. Rigorous microbiota typing could, therefore, soon become part of a complete phenotypic analysis of IBD patients. Moreover, individual susceptibility and environmental triggers such as nutrition, medications, age or smoking could modify bacterial strains in the bowel habitat. Pharmacological manipulation of bowel microbiota is somewhat controversial. The employment of antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics has been widely addressed in the literature worldwide, with the aim of obtaining positive results in a number of IBD patient settings, and determining the appropriate timing and modality of this intervention. Recently, novel treatments for IBDs, such as fecal microbiota transplantation, when accepted by patients, have shown promising results. Controlled studies are being designed. In the near future, new therapeutic strategies can be expected, with non-pathogenic or modified food organisms that can be genetically modified to exert anti-inflammatory properties.},

This article offers findings from a study that used four semistructured audiorecorded interviews during a 4-week time period for the purpose of exploring the experiences of 11 individuals before and after receiving dietary fiber information from a healthcare professional. The first and second interviews occurred immediately before and after the presentation of information. Follow-up interviews occurred at 2-week intervals. Thematic analysis of the baseline interviews revealed 2 themes: (a) accepting a redefined (lower expectations) definition of normal quality of life and (b) continuing to look for answers. Three themes emerged from the follow-up interviews at Week 4: (a) reevaluating old diet-related concepts, (b) enjoying a healthier lifestyle at a self-set pace, and (c) enjoying positive physical effects of wheat bran consumption. This article examines the 3rd postintervention theme, "enjoying physical effects of wheat bran consumption." The relevance of this research is that nurses equipped with dietary fiber information may be better able to help some individuals with Crohn disease to explore the potential benefits of a well-rounded nutritious pattern of eating that includes wheat bran cereal.},

   abstract = {Crohn disease is a chronic disorder characterized by episodes of epithelial inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract for which there is no cure. The prevalence of Crohn disease increased in civilized nations during the time period in which food sources were industrialized in those nations. A characteristic of industrialized diets is the conspicuous absence of cereal fiber. The purpose of this 2-group, randomized, controlled study was to investigate the effects of fiber-related dietary instructions specifying wheat bran consumption on health-related quality of life and gastrointestinal function in individuals diagnosed with Crohn disease, as measured by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and the partial Harvey Bradshaw Index, respectively. Results demonstrated that consuming a wheat bran-inclusive diet was feasible and caused no adverse effects, and participants consuming whole wheat bran in the diet reported improved health-related quality of life (p = .028) and gastrointestinal function (p = .008) compared to the attention control group. The results of a secondary aim, to investigate differences in measures of systemic inflammation, found no group differences in C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rates. This study suggests that diet modification may be a welcomed complementary therapy for individuals suffering gastrointestinal disruption associated with Crohn disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing in Eastern Europe possibly due to changes in environmental factors towards a more "westernised" standard of living. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in exposure to environmental factors prior to diagnosis in Eastern and Western European IBD patients. METHODS: The EpiCom cohort is a population-based, prospective inception cohort of 1560 unselected IBD patients from 31 European countries covering a background population of 10.1 million. At the time of diagnosis patients were asked to complete an 87-item questionnaire concerning environmental factors. RESULTS: A total of 1182 patients (76%) answered the questionnaire, 444 (38%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 627 (53%) ulcerative colitis (UC), and 111 (9%) IBD unclassified. No geographic differences regarding smoking status, caffeine intake, use of oral contraceptives, or number of first-degree relatives with IBD were found. Sugar intake was higher in CD and UC patients from Eastern Europe than in Western Europe while fibre intake was lower (p<0.01). Daily consumption of fast food as well as appendectomy before the age of 20 was more frequent in Eastern European than in Western European UC patients (p<0.01). Eastern European CD and UC patients had received more vaccinations and experienced fewer childhood infections than Western European patients (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this European population-based inception cohort of unselected IBD patients, Eastern and Western European patients differed in environmental factors prior to diagnosis. Eastern European patients exhibited higher occurrences of suspected risk factors for IBD included in the Western lifestyle.},

   abstract = {After a short overview of the history of probiotics, the author presents the development of human intestinal microflora based on the newest genetic data and the microbiological features of main probiotics. The indications of probiotic administration have been defined and extended in recent years. The author reviews significant results of probiotic treatment in some gastrointestinal diseases based on meta-analytical data. Probiotics are useful in preventing and treating diarrhoea caused by antibiotics and Clostridium difficile caused diarrhoea. In the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, preparations containing certain Lactobacillus,Bifidobacterium strains or Saccaromyces boulardii could enhance by 5-10% the rate of successful eradication and reduce the incidence and severity of the side effects. Some symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and thus the quality of life can be improved by probiotics. Their beneficial effect in ulcerative colitis was proven, while in Crohn's disease has not yet been defined. The use of probiotics is not included in guidelines, with the exception of the Maastricht IV/Florence consensus. For each disease it is advisable to use probiotics containing strains only with proven beneficial effect. The efficiency of preparations containing mixed strains has not yet been properly investigated. The author reviews the rare but potentially serious side effects of probiotics. In Hungary, there are many probiotic preparations available which can be purchased in pharmacies without prescription: their use is more empirical than evidence-based. The European Food Safety Authority has recently rejected claims for probiotics to be classed as medicines given the lack of convincing evidence on the effects of probiotics on human health and well-being. Clearly, further research is needed to collect evidence which could be incorporated into the international guidelines.},

   abstract = {The gut mucosa undergoes continuous antigenic exposure from food antigens, commensal flora derived ligands, and pathogens. This constant stimulation results in controlled inflammatory responses that are effectively suppressed by multiple factors. This tight regulation, necessary to maintain intestinal homeostasis, is affected during inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) resulting in altered immune responses to harmless microorganisms. Dendritic cells (DCs) are sentinels of immunity, located in peripheral and lymphoid tissues, which are essential for homeostasis of T cell-dependent immune responses. The expression of a particular set of pathogen recognition receptors allows DCs to initiate immune responses. However, in the absence of danger signals, different DC subsets can induce active tolerance by inducing regulatory T cells (Treg), inhibiting inflammatory T helper cell responses, or both. Interestingly, several protocols to generate clinical grade tolerogenic DC (tol-DCs) in vitro have been described, opening the possibility to restore the intestinal homeostasis to bacterial flora by cellular therapy. In this review, we discuss different DC subsets and their role in IBD. Additionally, we will review preclinical studies performed in animal models while describing recent characterization of tol-DCs from Crohn's disease patients for clinical application.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dietary factors have been indicated to influence the pathogenesis and nature course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with their wide variances. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and clinical significance of 14 serum food specific immunoglobulin G (sIgG) antibodies in patients with IBD. METHODS: This retrospective study comprised a total of 112 patients with IBD, including 79 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 33 with ulcerative colitis (UC). Medical records, clinical data and laboratory results were collected for analysis. Serum IgG antibodies against 14 unique food allergens were detected by semi-quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Food sIgG antibodies were detected in 75.9% (60/79) of CD patients, 63.6% (21/33) of UC patients and 33.1% (88/266) of healthy controls (HC). IBD patients showed the significantly higher antibodies prevalence than healthy controls (CD vs. HC, P = 0.000; UC vs. HC, P = 0.001). However no marked difference was observed between CD and UC groups (P = 0.184). More subjects were found with sensitivity to multiple antigens (>/= 3) in IBD than in HC group (33.9% vs.0.8%, P = 0.000). Egg was the most prevalent food allergen. There was a remarkable difference in the levels of general serum IgM (P = 0.045) and IgG (P = 0.041) between patients with positive and negative sIgG antibodies. Patients with multiple positive allergens (>/= 3) were especially found with significant higher total IgG levels compared with sIgG-negative patients (P = 0.003). Age was suggested as a protective factor against the occurrence of sIgG antibodies (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates a high prevalence of serum IgG antibodies to specific food allergens in patients with IBD. sIgG antibodies may potentially indicate disease status in clinical and be utilized to guide diets for patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a chronic granulomatous condition of the mouth, face and lips. Recent work demonstrates a high rate of atopy and silver birch sensitisation from skin prick testing (SPT). Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is an acute oro-pharyngeal IgE mediated reaction, triggered by foods that cross react with pollens, most commonly silver birch. The aim of this study was to determine if patients with OFG and positive SPT to common OAS associated pollens responded to avoidance of cross reactive foods. METHODS: Patients with OFG and positive SPT to silver birch, grass, mugwort, ragweed and latex were required to avoid cross reacting foods, for 6 weeks and, in those who responded, for a total of 12 weeks. All had standardized oral examinations and were given severity scores (SS) at each appointment. RESULTS: Twenty two of 47 (47%) patients had one or more positive SPT and 13/22 completed 6 weeks on the diet. No difference was seen in SS between weeks 0 (14.62 +/- 11.16) and 6 (13.31 +/- 10.33; P = 0.656). Six of 14 (43%) had significantly improved SS (week 0; 19.17 +/- 12.95, week 6; 10.83 +/- 4.99, P = 0.027). Five completed 12 weeks and no further improvement was seen (week 6; 11 +/- 5.57, week 12; 10.4 +/- 9.94; P = 0.068). Two patients required no further treatments. CONCLUSIONS: On an intention to treat basis, only 2/14 patients improved and required no further intervention. Whilst this diet cannot be recommended routinely, the improvement seen in some patients raises questions about the role of OAS in patients with OFG.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a rare disease of unknown cause. A cinnamon- and benzoate-free diet is successful in up to 72% of patients. Phenolic acids are among the chemical constituents restricted in this diet, which avoids some but not all of these structurally similar compounds. The present study aimed to: (i) develop a novel diet low in phenolic acids; (ii) implement this in a small clinical trial; and (iii) assess its nutritional adequacy. METHODS: A literature review identified 10 papers quantifying phenolic acids from which 91 10-mg phenolic acid exchanges were devised. A phenolic acid exclusion diet with precautionary micronutrient supplementation was designed and implemented in 10 patients. Phenolic acids were excluded for 6 weeks and were reintroduced at a rate of one exchange every second day for 6 weeks. Wilcoxon matched pairs tests analysed disease outcomes measured by an oral disease severity scoring tool at weeks 0, 6 and 12. Nutritional adequacy was assessed, excluding micronutrient supplementation, at weeks 0 and 6, and compared intakes with dietary reference values. RESULTS: The diet was nutritionally inadequate for a range of micronutrients. Seven of 10 patients responded. Mean [standard deviation (SD)] severity scores improved from week 0-6 [20.8 (9.39) and 10.1 (5.72); P = 0.009] and were maintained in five patients who completed the reintroduction [6.6 (3.13) and 7.2 (5.54); P = 0.713]. CONCLUSIONS: A low phenolic acid diet with micronutrient supplementation holds promise of a novel dietary treatment for OFG. Further work is required in larger studies to determine long-term outcomes.},

   abstract = {Important advances during the last decade have been made in understanding the complex etiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). While many gaps in our knowledge still exist, it has been suggested that the etiology of CD is multifactorial including genetic, environmental and infectious factors. The most widely accepted theory states that CD is caused by an aggressive immune response to infectious agents in genetically predisposed individuals. The rise of genome-wide association studies allowed the identification of loci and genetic variants in several components of host innate and adaptive immune responses to microorganisms in the gut, highlighting an implication of intestinal microbiota in CD etiology. Moreover, numerous independent studies reported a dysbiosis, i.e., a modification of intestinal microbiota composition, with an imbalance between the abundance of beneficial and harmful bacteria. Although microorganisms including viruses, yeasts, fungi and bacteria have been postulated as potential CD pathogens, based on epidemiological, clinicopathological, genetic and experimental evidence, their precise role in this disease is not clearly defined. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the infectious agents associated with an increased risk of developing CD. Therapeutic approaches to modulate the intestinal dysbiosis and to target the putative CD-associated pathogens, as well as their potential mechanisms of action are also discussed.},

   abstract = {Two young female Beagle dogs in a laboratory colony with clinical signs of loose stools and fecal blood were confirmed to have histiocytic ulcerative colitis by histologic evaluation. This syndrome is well recognized in other dog breeds such as Boxers and related French Bulldogs, Mastiffs, Alaskan malamutes and Doberman Pinschers. Formalin-fixed paraffin sections of large intestine from one dog demonstrated the presence of Escherichia coli strain LF82 by immunohistochemistry and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. E coli strain LF82 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and similar bacteria have been cultured from cases of histiocytic ulcerative colitis in Boxer dogs. Spontaneous histiocytic ulcerative colitis must be differentiated from test article-related findings in nonclinical toxicity studies in Beagle dogs.},

   abstract = {Non-specific inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn`s disease, is a chronic noninfectious inflammatory disease whose incidence is increasingly high, especially in the developed countries. Effective methods of its treatment and prevention of recurrences are still under investigation. Amongst the options to control effectively the inflammatory processes of the gastrointestinal tract are thiazolidinediones - peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists, whose beneficial effects on macroscopic and histopathological features of colitis have been confirmed in numerous studies. In the present study, possible effects of PPAR-gamma agonists rosiglitazone and troglitazone enhancing the resistance of colonic tissues to the damaging factor were examined and compared. Rats received the food with 0.01% rosiglitazone or troglitazone for 4 weeks; during the final 2 weeks, colitis-inducing 1.5% DSS (dextran sodium sulfate) was additionally administered in the drinking water. The large intestine specimens were microscopically evaluated and the levels of Th1- (IL-2, INF) and Th2-dependent (IL-4, IL-10) cytokines were determined in the serum and intestinal homogenates. Prophylactic treatment with rosiglitazone and troglitazone ameliorated colitis substantially down-regulating the microscopic inflammatory parameters. Rosiglitazone and troglitazone administered before the induction of colitis exerted comparable effects on colitis. Both substances significantly reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the levels of inflammation-limiting cytokines. We conclude that thiazolidinedione drugs are likely to be successfully used for therapy and prevention of non-specific bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are plausible mechanisms for how dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, could prevent Crohn's disease (CD). AIM: To conduct a prospective study to investigate the association between increased intake of DHA and risk of CD. METHODS: Overall, 229 702 participants were recruited from nine European centres between 1991 and 1998. At recruitment, dietary intakes of DHA and fatty acids were measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored through to June 2004 to identify participants who developed incident CD. In a nested case-control analysis, each case was matched with four controls; odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for quintiles of DHA intake, adjusted for total energy intake, smoking, other dietary fatty acids, dietary vitamin D and body mass index. RESULTS: Seventy-three participants developed incident CD. All higher quintiles of DHA intake were inversely associated with development of CD; the highest quintile had the greatest effect size (OR = 0.07; 95% CI = 0.02-0.81). The OR trend across quintiles of DHA was 0.54 (95% CI = 0.30-0.99, Ptrend = 0.04). Including BMI in the multivariate analysis, due to its correlation with dietary fat showed similar associations. There were no associations with the other dietary fatty acids studied. CONCLUSION: There were inverse associations, with a biological gradient between increasing dietary docosahexaenoic acid intakes and incident Crohn's disease. Further studies in other populations should measure docosahexaenoic acid to determine if the association is consistent and the hypothesis tested in randomised controlled trials of purely docosahexaenoic acid supplementation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet may have a role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. In previous studies, the associations between increased intakes of carbohydrates, sugar, starch, and inflammatory bowel disease are inconsistent. However, few prospective studies have investigated the associations between these macronutrients and incident Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: A total of 401,326 men and women were recruited between 1991 and 1998. At recruitment, dietary intakes of carbohydrate, sugar, and starch were measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored identifying participants who developed incident CD or UC. Cases were matched with 4 controls, and odds ratios were calculated for quintiles of total carbohydrate, sugar, and starch intakes adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, and smoking. RESULTS: One hundred ten participants developed CD, and 244 participants developed UC during follow-up. The adjusted odds ratio for the highest versus the lowest quintiles of total carbohydrate intake for CD was 0.87, 95% CI = 0.24 to 3.12 and for UC 1.46, 95% CI = 0.62 to 3.46, with no significant trends across quintiles for either (CD, P trend = 0.70; UC, P trend = 0.41). Similarly, no associations were observed with intakes of total sugar (CD, P trend = 0.50; UC, P trend = 0.71) or starch (CD, P trend = 0.69; UC, P trend = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of associations with these nutrients is in agreement with many case-control studies that have not identified associations with CD or UC. As there is biological plausibility for how specific carbohydrates could have an etiological role in inflammatory bowel disease, future epidemiological work should assess individual carbohydrates, although there does not seem to be a macronutrient effect.},

A growing body of research has proposed that probiotics are able to attenuate the inflammatory symptoms of these diseases in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism of probiotic actions remains unclear. RESULTS: Our results suggested Lactobacillus plantarum MYL26 inhibited inflammation in Caco-2 cells through regulation of gene expressions of TOLLIP, SOCS1, SOCS3, and IkappaBalpha, rather than SHIP-1 and IRAK-3. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed that live/ heat-killed Lactobacillus plantarum MYL26 and bacterial cell wall extract treatments impaired TLR4-NFkappab signal transduction through Tollip, SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 activation, thus inducing LPS tolerance. Our findings suggest that either heat-killed probiotics or probiotic cell wall extracts are able to attenuate inflammation through pathways similar to that of live bacteria.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To review the evidence supporting the validity of billing, procedural, or diagnosis code, or pharmacy claim-based algorithms used to identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in administrative and claim databases. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE database from 1991 to September 2012 using controlled vocabulary and key terms related to RA and reference lists of included studies were searched. Two investigators independently assessed the full text of studies against pre-determined inclusion criteria and extracted the data. Data collected included participant and algorithm characteristics. RESULTS: Nine studies reported validation of computer algorithms based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes with or without free-text, medication use, laboratory data and the need for a diagnosis by a rheumatologist. These studies yielded positive predictive values (PPV) ranging from 34 to 97% to identify patients with RA. Higher PPVs were obtained with the use of at least two ICD and/or procedure codes (ICD-9 code 714 and others), the requirement of a prescription of a medication used to treat RA, or requirement of participation of a rheumatologist in patient care. For example, the PPV increased from 66 to 97% when the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and the presence of a positive rheumatoid factor were required. CONCLUSIONS: There have been substantial efforts to propose and validate algorithms to identify patients with RA in automated databases. Algorithms that include more than one code and incorporate medications or laboratory data and/or required a diagnosis by a rheumatologist may increase the PPV.},

   abstract = {Literature reports describe kiwi fruit as a food with significant effects on human health, including anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Fresh fruit or raw kiwi fruit extracts have been used so far to investigate these effects, but the molecule(s) responsible for these health-promoting activities have not yet been identified. Kissper is a kiwi fruit peptide displaying pore-forming activity in synthetic lipid bilayers, the composition of which is similar to that found in intestinal cells. The objective of this study was to investigate the kissper influence on intestinal inflammation using cultured cells and ex-vivo tissues from healthy subjects and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. The anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of kissper were tested on Caco-2 cells and on the colonic mucosa from 23 patients with CD, by challenging with the lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli (EC-LPS) and monitoring the appropriate markers by Western blot and immunofluorescence. EC-LPS challenge determined an increase in the intracellular concentration of calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The peptide kissper was highly effective in preventing the increase of LPS-induced ROS levels in both the Caco-2 cells and CD colonic mucosa. Moreover, it controls the calcium increase, p65-nuclear factor (NF)-kB induction and transglutaminase 2 (TG2) activation inflammatory response in Caco-2 cells and CD colonic mucosa. Kissper efficiently counteracts the oxidative stress and inflammatory response in valuable model systems consisting of intestinal cells and CD colonic mucosa. This study reports the first evidence supporting a possible correlation between some beneficial effects of kiwi fruit and a specific protein molecule rather than generic nutrients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate clinical and mucosal responses to the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) in children with Crohn disease (CD). METHODS: Eligible patients with active CD (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] >/= 15) underwent a patency capsule and, if passed intact, capsule endoscopy (CE) was performed. Patients taking SCD were monitored for 52 weeks while maintaining all prescribed medications. Demographic, dietary, and clinical information, PCDAI, Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), and Lewis score (LS) were collected at 0, 12, and 52 weeks. CEs were evaluated by an experienced reader blinded to patient clinical information and timing. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were screened; 10 enrolled; and 9 completed the initial 12-week trial-receiving 85% of estimated caloric needs before, and 101% on the SCD. HB significantly decreased from 3.3 +/- 2.0 to 0.6 +/- 1.3 (P = 0.007) as did PCDAI (21.1 +/- 5.9 to 7.8 +/- 7.1, P = 0.011). LS declined significantly from 2153 +/- 732 to 960 +/- 433 (P = 0.012). Seven patients continued the SCD up to 52 weeks; HB (0.1 +/- 0.4) and PCDAI (5.4 +/- 5.5) remained improved (P = 0.016 and 0.027 compared to baseline), with mean LS at 1046 +/- 372 and 2 patients showed sustained mucosal healing. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and mucosal improvements were seen in children with CD, who used SCD for 12 and 52 weeks. In addition, CE can monitor mucosal improvement in treatment trials for pediatric CD. Further studies are critically needed to understand the mechanisms underlying SCD's effectiveness in children with CD.},

   abstract = {Increased dietary ratios of omega6/omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD), but epidemiologic data are limited. We investigated whether variants of genes that control polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism (CYP4F3, FADS1, and FADS2), along with the dietary ratio of omega6/omega3, confers susceptibility to CD. Based on data from 182 children newly diagnosed with CD and 250 controls, we found that children who consumed a higher dietary ratio of omega6/omega3 were susceptible for CD if they were also carriers of specific variants of CYP4F3 and FADS2 genes. Our findings implicate diet-gene interactions in the pathogenesis of CD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease affects a substantial number of women in their reproductive years. Pregnancy presents a number of challenges for clinicians and patients; the health of the baby needs to be balanced with the need to maintain remission in the mother. Historically, treatments for Crohn's disease (CD) were often discontinued during the pregnancy, or nursing period, due to concerns about teratogenicity. Fortunately, observational data has reported the relative safety of many agents used to treat CD, including 5-aminosalicylic acid, thiopurines, and tumor necrosis factor. Data on the long-term development outcomes of children exposed to these therapies in utero are still limited. It is most important that physicians educate the patient regarding the optimal time to conceive, discuss the possible risks, and together decide on the best management strategy.},

Serum vitamin A level was markedly depleted (11 microg/dL, reference 20-120 microg/dL), and full-field electroretinogram testing demonstrated extinguished scotopic (rod function) responses and decreased amplitudes of photopic responses on 30 Hz flicker (cone function). He was started on vitamin A supplementation (initially intramuscular). His vitamin A level was back to normal (78 microg/dL), and night vision problems subjectively improved. Patients with Crohn's disease should be inquired about night vision problems. The presence of nyctalopia should prompt vitamin A level measurement and ophthalmology referral for further evaluation.},

   abstract = {Increased understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) has led to new therapeutic strategies. One of these is to target the molecules that regulate interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells at sites of inflammation (mainly leukocyte integrins and endothelial cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily). These molecules have been validated as therapeutic targets for IBD; several have shown efficacy, and 2 have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of IBD. Natalizumab, the first anti-integrin antibody tested for treatment of IBD, blocks the alpha4 subunit. Although it is effective, its clinical use has been limited by its association with risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Other, allegedly more selective drugs that affect leukocyte recruitment in the gastrointestinal tract have been developed or are under investigation and could increase safety. These include vedolizumab and AMG 181 (antibodies against alpha4beta7), etrolizumab (anti-beta7), and PF-00547659 (anti-mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1). Other agents have been developed to block alpha4 (the small molecule AJM300), CCR9 (the small molecule CCX282-B), and CXCL10 (the antibody eldelumab). We review the scientific rationale for inhibiting interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells to reduce intestinal inflammation and analyze the clinical studies that have been performed to test these new molecules, with particular attention to safety. We propose an evidence-based clinical positioning of this class of drugs.},

TS affects residents of, and visitors to, endemic tropical regions. Rarely the disease may remain latent for several years, and to date, few cases of latent TS have been reported in Europe or North America. However, in our increasingly multicultural communities and in a 'global village' where travel is common, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for TS in patients presenting with diarrhea and malabsorption who have traveled to endemic regions. TS may mimic common diarrheal diseases that are seen in developed nations, including celiac disease, Crohn's disease, bacterial overgrowth, and other infectious etiologies. Accordingly, once these more common etiologies have been ruled out, TS must be considered in patients presenting with diarrhea after travel to endemic regions. We present a unique Canadian case of latent TS, with a brief review of the diagnostic approach and treatment.},

The supplement was diluted in water, and an acceptance test was done to evaluate the aroma, flavour, and viscosity of the product using facial hedonic scale (nine-point scale), applied on 54 CD patients. The supplement composition indicated 73.3% protein, 10.5% fat, 2.2% ash, 6.3% water, and 7.7% carbohydrate. The supplement is presented as a good protein source and high content of essential amino acids. The average acceptance for all the attributes was between 5.0 and 6.0, and the flavour was mainly associated with soybean/grain, sour milk, and sweet/vanilla flavour. The results indicated that the supplement provided important nutritional properties for CD patients; however, for a large number of individuals to be encouraged to perform supplementation, it is essential to improve the sensory quality of the product. In order to do so, additional research is necessary to prevent the formation of volatiles which cause off-flavours or to mask undesirable aromas/flavours found in it.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A six-week course of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is recommended as first treatment in active paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to assess short-term and long-term outcome of EEN, and to identify predictive factors of treatment success. METHODS: The medical records of newly diagnosed paediatric CD patients initiating EEN as remission induction therapy between January 2008 and October 2011 were retrospectively studied. Treatment outcome was assessed using a previously described pattern recognition model. RESULTS: 77 CD patients (median age 13.9 years, 57% male) initiated a six-week course of EEN, combined with azathioprine maintenance treatment in 92%. Patients received EEN as either hyperosmolar sip feeds or polymeric formula by nasogastric tube. In patients completing a six-week course of EEN (n=58), complete remission was achieved in 71%, partial remission in 26%, and no response in 3%. Complete remission rates were higher in children presenting with isolated ileal/ileocaecal disease and malnutrition. Nineteen patients discontinued EEN before the intended treatment period due to worsening of symptoms (n=9) or adherence issues (n=10). Non-adherence occurred more often in older children, females, children from non-Dutch parents, and patients taking hyperosmolar sip feeds compared with polymeric formula by nasogastric tube. The likelihood of relapsing disease within the first year after EEN treatment was 59%. CONCLUSION: A six-week course of EEN is effective in newly diagnosed paediatric CD, with response rates that seem to be influenced by disease location and nutritional status, but not by type of formula. Non-adherence occurs frequently and limits the success of this treatment in everyday clinical practice.},

While the development of the immune system and the establishment of the microflora take place during infancy young patients often have a more severe and extensive disease. The differences in composition and concentration of intestinal microbiota and aberrant immune responses towards the luminal bacteria prompted the concept of an 'ecological' approach to control the disease course. Probiotics, living, non pathogenic micro organisms with a beneficial effect on the host, and prebiotics, oligosaccharides promoting the growth of the beneficial microflora, have been studied to this effect. Results have so far been disappointing for Crohn's disease but encouraging for ulcerative colitis. An overview of studies using probiotics in adults or children and a perspective on specific pediatric issues is provided in this review.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although intestinal dysbiosis is well established in Crohn's disease (CD), little is known about the microbial metabolic activity of CD patients. In this study, we compared the metabolite patterns of the CD patients with profiles from healthy controls (HCs) and correlated them to disease activity and bacterial composition. In addition, the influence of the prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin (OF-IN) on the CD metabolites profile was evaluated. METHODS: Sixty-seven inactive and moderately active CD patients were included in a double-blinded randomized placebo controlled trial (RCT). Patients consumed either 10 g OF-IN or 10 g placebo twice per day for 4 weeks. They collected a fecal sample before the start of the study (baseline) and after the treatment period. In addition, fecal samples were obtained from 40 HCs. The metabolite profile was assessed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of fecal metabolites was significantly higher in HCs than in CD patients (P<0.001). Forty compounds differed between CD patients and HCs. When correlating the metabolite levels to disease activity, significantly lower levels of butyrate, pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, and p-cresol were found in active patients as compared with HCs. In the RCT, no significant changes in the metabolite pattern were found in patients randomized to placebo. In patients receiving OF-IN (per protocol; n=21), the relative levels of acetaldehyde (P=0.0008) and butyrate (P=0.0011) were significantly increased as compared with baseline. CONCLUSIONS: We identified medium chain fatty acids and p-cresol as differentiating metabolites toward CD disease status and as compared with HCs. In addition, OF-IN intake primarily increased the carbohydrate fermentation metabolites butyrate and acetaldehyde.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacteria play a role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in IBD. Compositional alterations may also change the metabolic capacities of the gut bacteria. OBJECTIVE: To examine the metabolic activity of the microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), UC or pouchitis compared with healthy controls (HC) and determine whether eventual differences might be related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained from 40 HC, 83 patients with CD, 68 with UC and 13 with pouchitis. Disease activity was assessed in CD using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, in UC using the UC Disease Activity Index and in pouchitis using the Pouchitis Disease Activity Index. Metabolite profiles were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of metabolites identified in HC (54) was significantly higher than in patients with CD (44, p<0.001), UC (47, p=0.042) and pouchitis (43, p=0.036). Multivariate discriminant analysis predicted HC, CD, UC and pouchitis group membership with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs: pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate and nonanoate), and of some protein fermentation metabolites, were significantly decreased in patients with CD, UC and pouchitis. Hexanoate levels were inversely correlated to disease activity in CD (correlation coefficient=-0.157, p=0.046), whereas a significant positive correlation was found between styrene levels and disease activity in UC (correlation coefficient=0.338, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Faecal metabolic profiling in patients with IBD relative to healthy controls identified MCFAs as important metabolic biomarkers of disease-related changes.

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by impaired mineralization of the bone matrix. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption syndromes may cause osteomalacia. This is a case of a patient with a 6-year history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's disease who was admitted to our outpatient clinic with symptoms of osteomalacia. INTRODUCTION: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disease characterized by an impaired mineralization of the bone matrix, frequently caused by disorders in vitamin D or phosphate metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption syndromes (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and jejuno-ileal bypass for obesity) may cause osteomalacia. CASE REPORT: A 43-year-old male presented with fatigue, low back pain, and morning stiffness. He had a 6-year history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's disease. Laboratory findings revealed low serum calcium, low 25-hydroxy vitamin D3, normal phosphorus, elevated parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase levels. Radiographs revealed grade IV sacroiliitis and Looser zones. He was diagnosed with osteomalacia due to the malabsorption of vitamin D. His symptoms and signs were relieved with supplements of vitamin D and calcium. CONCLUSIONS: Osteomalacia should be considered in differential diagnosis when assessing low back pain in the patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamin D deficiency should be treated with vitamin D supplementation in patients with Crohn's disease to prevent osteomalacia.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors is unclear, whether related to concomitant thiopurines usage or due to the underlying inflammatory disease. We sought to review all cases of T-cell NHL reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in patients receiving TNF-alpha inhibitors for all approved indications and examine the risk of T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors in comparison with the use of thiopurines in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) was queried for all lymphomas following treatment with the following TNF-alpha inhibitors: infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, and their trade names. Full reports for T-cell NHL cases were identified using the Freedom of Information Act. In addition, T-cell NHL reported in patients IBD with the use of the thiopurines-azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and their trade names were also collected. A search of MEDLINE was performed for additional T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors or thiopurines, not reported to the FDA but available in published literature. The histological subtypes of T-cell NHL reported with TNF-alpha inhibitors were compared with reported subtypes in Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) -17 registry. Reported risk of T-cell NHL in IBD with TNF-alpha inhibitors, thiopurines, or concomitant use was calculated using Fisher's exact test using 5-aminosalicylates as control drugs. RESULTS: A total of 3,130,267 reports were downloaded from the FDA AERS (2003-2010). Ninety-one cases of T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors were identified in the FDA AERS and nine additional cases were identified on MEDLINE search. A total of 38 patients had rheumatoid arthritis, 36 cases had Crohn's disease, 11 had psoriasis, 9 had ulcerative colitis, and 6 had ankylosing spondylitis. Sixty-eight of the cases (68%) involved exposure to both a TNF-alpha inhibitor and an immunomodulator (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, leflunomide, or cyclosporine). Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) was the most common reported subtype, whereas mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome and HSTCL were identified as more common with TNF-alpha-inhibitor exposure compared with SEER-17 registry. Nineteen cases of T-cell NHL with thiopurines were identified in the FDA AERS and one additional case on MEDLINE. Reported risk of T-cell NHL was higher with TNF-alpha inhibitor use in combination with thiopurines (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.98-354.09; P<0.0001) and thiopurines alone (95% CI 8.32-945.38; P<0.0001) but not with TNF-alpha inhibitor use alone (95% CI 0.13-10.61; P=1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Risk of T-cell NHL is increased with TNF-alpha inhibitor use in combination with thiopurines but not with TNF-alpha inhibitors alone.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) are abnormally predominant on Crohn's disease (CD) ileal mucosa. AIEC strains adhere to enterocytes via interaction between type 1 pili and CEACAM6 receptors abnormally expressed on CD ileal mucosa, leading to gut inflammation. We analysed whether epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the upregulation of CEACAM6 expression in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). DESIGN: Methylation of CEACAM6 promoter was analysed using bisulfite sequencing and site-specific methylation by SnapShot. pCpGfree reporter system was used to analyse CEACAM6 promoter activity. Transgenic mice expressing human CEACAM6 fed either standard food or a low-methyl diet (LMD) were orally challenged with 10(9) AIEC LF82. After 3 days, gut-associated AIEC and proinflammatory cytokines were quantified. RESULTS: Analysis of CEACAM6 gene promoter revealed potentially methylated dinucleotide CpGs within HIF-1-responsive elements (HREs). Methylation levels of CpG within CEACAM6 promoter were inversely correlated with CEACAM6 expression in IEC expressing various levels of CEACAM6. We show the critical role of HRE methylation and transcription factor HIF-1 in the regulation of CEACAM6 gene in IEC. This was confirmed in transgenic mice expressing human CEACAM6 fed a LMD. LMD-dependent HRE demethylation led to abnormal gut expression of CEACAM6, favouring AIEC colonisation and subsequent inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: HRE hypomethylation in CEACAM6 promoter correlates with high expression in IEC. Our findings suggest that abnormal DNA methylation leading to CEACAM6 increased expression and AIEC-mediated gut inflammation can be related to changes in nutritional habits, such as low intake in methyl donor molecules, leading to abnormal epigenetic marks in mouse model mimicking CD susceptibility.},

   abstract = {Accumulating evidence implicates defective innate immunity in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). Ineffectual NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2) is the most common susceptibility gene contributing to CD. Vitamin D (vD), a potent modulator of innate and adaptive immunity, induces NOD2 gene expression and its downstream function. We hypothesized that the hormonal form of vD (1,25D) could beneficially modulate innate immune function in CD. Using peripheral mononuclear cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) from CD, it was found that 1,25D decreased Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced cytokine production and enhanced cytokine levels induced by muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the NOD2 ligand. 1,25D increased the synergistic effect provided by NOD2 and TLR co-activation on interleukin (IL)-10, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Whereas 1,25D inhibits Mo-DC TLR-induced cytokines, co-stimulation of NOD2 results in increased IL-10 and IL-23. IL-12p70 was completely abrogated by 1,25D. 1,25D similarly modulated cytokine production by immune cells in ulcerative colitis patients and healthy controls. Mo-DCs from CD patients heterozygous for NOD2 mutations had a response similar to those from patients without NOD2 mutations. Immune cells from patients homozygous for the 1007 fs mutation were unresponsive to MDP and 1,25D. Our in vitro data support 1,25D as a potential modulator of immunity. However, these results cannot be extrapolated to CD patients without further controlled studies.},

   abstract = {A growing body of experimental and clinical evidence supports the hypothesis that the intestinal microbiota markedly influences function and the structure of the mucosal lining. Intestinal microbiota can potentially cause damage to the mucosa either directly by releasing toxins or indirectly by causing a detrimental immune response. Probiotic bacteria have been defined as live microorganisms, which when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit for the host. In recent years, the therapeutic and preventive application of probiotics for several gastrointestinal and liver disorders has received increasing attention. Probiotics appear to be beneficial for premature infants who suffer necrotizing enterocolitis. The effectiveness of certain probiotics as treatment for infectious and antibioticassociated diarrhea in adults and for allergic disorders in children has been supported by clinical studies; however, the potential mechanism( s) remains to be studied. Experimental studies and clinical trials for probiotic treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have yielded conflicting results. Daily intake of selected probiotics was effective in the prevention of ulcerative colitis and the attenuation of the active onset of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis but others failed to show a beneficial effect. The combination of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces boulardi and the treatment with Escherichia coli Nissle were found beneficial in inducing and maintaining remission of disease activity of gut inflammation and moderately severe ulcerative colitis. Probiotic bacteria were considered in some studies as a safe adjuvant when added to triple eradication therapy against the symptoms induced by the major gastric pathogen, Helicobacter pylori. This review attempted to overview these new exciting advances in the role of these microbes in the pathogenesis, management and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.},

   abstract = {Probiotic microorganisms have historically been used to rebalance disturbed intestinal microbiota and to diminish gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhea or inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). Recent studies explore the potential for expanded uses of probiotics on medical disorders that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, such as obesity, hypercholesterolemia, arterial hypertension, and metabolic disturbances such as hyperhomocysteinemia and oxidative stress. This review aims at summarizing the proposed molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in probiotic-host interactions and to identify the nature of the resulting beneficial effects. Specific probiotic strains can act by modulating immune response, by producing particular molecules or releasing biopeptides, and by modulating nervous system activity. To date, the majority of studies have been conducted in animal models. New investigations on the related mechanisms in humans need to be carried out to better enable targeted and effective use of the broad variety of probiotic strains.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Many species within the phylum Firmicutes are thought to exert anti-inflammatory effects. We quantified bacteria belonging to the genus Butyricicoccus in stools of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). We evaluated the effect of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum in a rat colitis model and analysed the ability to prevent cytokine-induced increases in epithelial permeability. DESIGN: A genus-specific quantitative PCR was used for quantification of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC or CD and healthy subjects. The effect of B pullicaecorum on trinitrobenzenesulfonic (TNBS)-induced colitis was assessed and the effect of B pullicaecorum culture supernatant on epithelial barrier function was investigated in vitro. RESULTS: The average number of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC and CD in active (UC: 8.61 log10/g stool; CD: 6.58 log10/g stool) and remission phase (UC: 8.69 log10/g stool; CD: 8.38 log10/g stool) was significantly lower compared with healthy subjects (9.32 log10/g stool) and correlated with disease activity in CD. Oral administration of B pullicaecorum resulted in a significant protective effect based on macroscopic and histological criteria and decreased intestinal myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-12 levels. Supernatant of B pullicaecorum prevented the loss of transepithelial resistance (TER) and the increase in IL-8 secretion induced by TNFalpha and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in a Caco-2 cell model. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have lower numbers of Butyricicoccus bacteria in their stools. Administration of B pullicaecorum attenuates TNBS-induced colitis in rats and supernatant of B pullicaecorum cultures strengthens the epithelial barrier function by increasing the TER.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Proper interactions between the intestinal mucosa, gut microbiota and nutrient flow are required to establish homoeostasis of the host. Since the proximal part of the small intestine is the first region where these interactions occur, and since most of the nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum, it is important to understand the dynamics of metabolic responses of the mucosa in this intestinal region. DESIGN: Germ-free mice aged 8-10 weeks were conventionalised with faecal microbiota, and responses of the jejunal mucosa to bacterial colonisation were followed over a 30-day time course. Combined transcriptome, histology, (1)H NMR metabonomics and microbiota phylogenetic profiling analyses were used. RESULTS: The jejunal mucosa showed a two-phase response to the colonising microbiota. The acute-phase response, which had already started 1 day after conventionalisation, involved repression of the cell cycle and parts of the basal metabolism. The secondary-phase response, which was consolidated during conventionalisation (days 4-30), was characterised by a metabolic shift from an oxidative energy supply to anabolic metabolism, as inferred from the tissue transcriptome and metabonome changes. Detailed transcriptome analysis identified tissue transcriptional signatures for the dynamic control of the metabolic reorientation in the jejunum. The molecular components identified in the response signatures have known roles in human metabolic disorders, including insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the dynamic jejunal response to the microbiota and supports a prominent role for the jejunum in metabolic control, including glucose and energy homoeostasis. The molecular signatures of this process may help to find risk markers in the declining insulin sensitivity seen in human type 2 diabetes mellitus, for instance.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) was introduced 13 years ago by Given Imaging (Yokneam, Israel). It has become one of the most important investigational tools of the small bowel. The capsule is swallowed with water after a 12 h fast, propelled via peristalsis through the gastrointestinal tract and excreted naturally. A nonvideo patency capsule was developed to confirm functional patency of the gastrointestinal tract. RECENT FINDINGS: Four additional companies have introduced competitive small bowel video capsules, some of which are Food and Drug Admistration (FDA) approved. Due to the easiness of the procedure, SBCE has become a first-line tool to detect small bowel abnormalities. The main indications for SBCE include obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, suspected Crohn's disease, small bowel tumors and practically any abnormal small bowel imaging. New indications are emerging like small bowel motility and monitoring of drug therapy and mucosal healing. The present review will describe the available capsules in the market, the procedure itself, present indications and future expectations. It will focus on the PillCam SB of Given Imaging as it is the one on which most of the literature is written. SUMMARY: Over the past 10 years, SBCE has become a routine, first-line investigational tool of many small bowel pathologies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In paediatric Crohn's disease (PCD), 6-8 weeks of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is effective in 60-80% cases. EEN is followed by gradual food reintroduction over variable (1-5 weeks) periods. Currently, there is no recommended duration or method for food reintroduction. The rationale for slow reintroduction is unclear and may be because of concerns about food intolerance or to maintain longer remission. AIMS: The aims of this study were as follows: to compare relapse rates following standard and rapid reintroduction of food after EEN in PCD and to determine the duration of maintained remission in two groups of PCD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups with PCD were compared: group A received standard food reintroduction over 5 weeks and group B received rapid reintroduction over 3 days. Data were collected over two consecutive time periods: group A (2005-2009) and group B (2009-2011). Only patients with a new diagnosis of PCD were included. Those with strictures and those on steroids or biologicals during EEN were excluded. The minimum duration of follow-up was 1 year. RESULTS: Group A included 20 patients and group B included 19 patients. In these groups, EEN led to clinical remission in 80% of the patients in group A and in 76% of the patients in group B. At 6 months, one-third of the patients from each group had developed relapse and a year after EEN, 50% of the patients in group A and 47% of the patients in group B developed relapse. Time to first relapse was 188 days (group A) and 136 days (group B). None of these results were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In PCD, rapid food reintroduction following 6-week EEN is safe and equally effective as longer food reintroduction. We propose that a rapid food reintroduction schedule be recommended as the most tolerable approach for food reintroduction. Relapse rate and duration of remission are uninfluenced by the type of food reintroduction.},

In humans, the main route of transmission of MAP might be the intake of contaminated milk and dairy products. Considering that MAP has already been detected in many types of cheese in different counties, and that Coalho cheese is an important dairy product in northeastern Brazil, the aim of this study was to report the first detection of MAP in retail Coalho cheese in Brazil by PCR and culture. Of 30 retail Coalho cheese samples, 3 (10%) amplified fragments of a similar size to that expected (626 bp) were obtained and viable MAP was recovered by culture from 1 (3.3%) sample. The DNA from the positive culture sample was sequenced and showed 99% identity with the insertion sequence IS900 deposited in GenBank. It was possible to identify the presence of MAP-specific DNA in the analyzed samples for the first time in Brazil, and to recover viable cells from retail Coalho cheese.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Probiotic formulations of single species of bacteria have not been effective in preventing the recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgery. We investigated the ability of VSL#3, a mixture of 8 different bacterial probiotic species, to prevent Crohn's disease recurrence after surgery in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Within 30 days of ileocolonic resection and re-anastomosis, patients with Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to groups given 1 sachet of VSL#3 (900 billion viable bacteria, comprising 4 strains of Lactobacillus, 3 strains of Bifidobacterium, and 1 strain of Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus) (n = 59) or matching placebo (n = 60). Colonoscopy was performed at days 90 and 365 to evaluate the neoterminal ileum for disease recurrence and obtain mucosal biopsies for cytokine analysis. Patients from both groups with either no or mild endoscopic recurrence at day 90 received VSL#3 until day 365. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at day 90. RESULTS: At day 90, the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic lesions did not differ significantly between VSL#3 (9.3%) and placebo (15.7%, P = .19). The proportions of patients with non-severe lesions at day 90 who had severe endoscopic recurrence at day 365 were 10.0% in the early VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 for the entire 365 days) and 26.7% in the late VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 from days 90 through 365) (P = .09). Aggregate rates of severe recurrence (on days 90 and 365) were not statistically different, 20.5% of subjects in the early VSL#3 group and 42.1% in the late VSL#3 group. Patients receiving VSL#3 had reduced mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels compared with placebo at day 90 (P < .05). Crohn's disease activity index and inflammatory bowel disease quality of life scores were similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistical differences in endoscopic recurrence rates at day 90 between patients who received VSL#3 and patients who received placebo. Lower mucosal levels of inflammatory cytokines and a lower rate of recurrence among patients who received early VSL#3 (for the entire 365 days) indicate that this probiotic should be further investigated for prevention of Crohn's disease recurrence.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a defective intestinal barrier and enhanced adaptive immune responses against commensal microbiota. Immune responses against food antigens in IBD patients remain poorly defined. METHODS: IgG and IgA specific for food and microfloral antigens (wheat and milk extracts; purified ovalbumin; Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis lysates; mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were analyzed by ELISA in the serum and feces of patients with Crohn's disease (CD; n = 52 for serum and n = 20 for feces), ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 29; n = 17), acute gastroenteritis/colitis (AGE; n = 12; n = 9) as well as non-inflammatory controls (n = 61; n = 39). RESULTS: Serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-B. fragilis IgG and IgA levels were increased in CD patients whereas antibody (Ab) levels against E. coli and food antigens were not significantly different within the patient groups and controls. Subgroup analysis revealed that CD patients with severe diseases defined by stricturing and penetrating lesions have slightly higher anti-food and anti-microbial IgA levels whereas CD and UC patients with arthropathy have decreased anti-food IgG levels. Treatment with anti-TNF-alpha Abs in CD patients was associated with significantly decreased ASCA IgG and IgA and anti-E. coli IgG. In the feces specific IgG levels against all antigens were higher in CD and AGE patients while specific IgA levels were higher in non-IBD patients. Anti-food IgG and IgA levels did not correlate with food intolerance. SUMMARY: In contrast to anti-microbial Abs, we found only minor changes in serum anti-food Ab levels in specific subgroups of IBD patients. Fecal Ab levels towards microbial and food antigens show distinct patterns in controls, CD and UC patients.},

However, the effects of probiotics on the induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) still remain controversial. This systematic review verified the findings of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated the therapeutic effects of probiotics on IBD. After the quality assessment, 20 RCTs which investigated the effects of probiotics on the induction or maintenance of remission in IBD were identified. From the results of the validation of these RCTs, beneficial effects of probiotic treatments to improve the response rate and remission rate on the remission induction therapies [risk ratio (RR) 1.81; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.40-2.35 and RR 1.56; 95 % CI 0.95-2.56, respectively] were verified. Furthermore, probiotic treatments exhibited effects equal to mesalazine on the maintenance of remission in UC (RR 1.00; 95 % CI 0.79-1.26). In contrast, no significant effect of probiotic treatments was shown in either the induction or maintenance of remission in CD. Because there were many variations in the conditions among these studies, a further analysis evaluating the effects of probiotic treatments in IBD is needed to clarify the optimal probiotics and treatment regimens for each condition or population in IBD patients.},

   abstract = {AIM: Celiac disease (CD) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease induced by ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Despite technological progress, the diagnosis of CD is still based on duodenal biopsy as it was 50 years ago. In this study we analysed the expression of CD-associated genes in small bowel biopsies of patients and controls in order to explore the multivariate pathway of the expression profile of CD patients. Then, using multivariant discriminant analysis, we evaluated whether the expression profiles of these genes in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) differed between patients and controls. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven patients with active and 11 with treated CD, 40 healthy controls and 9 disease controls (Crohn's disease patients) were enrolled. RESULTS: Several genes were differentially expressed in CD patients versus controls, but the analysis of each single gene did not provided a comprehensive picture. A multivariate discriminant analysis showed that the expression of 5 genes in intestinal mucosa accounted for 93% of the difference between CD patients and controls. We then applied the same approach to PBMs, on a training set of 20 samples. The discriminant equation obtained was validated on a testing cohort of 10 additional cases and controls, and we obtained a correct classification of all CD cases and of 91% of the control samples. We applied this equation to treated CD patients and to disease controls and obtained a discrimination of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The combined expression of 4 genes allows one to discriminate between CD patients and controls, and between CD patients on a gluten-free diet and disease controls. Our results contribute to the understanding of the complex interactions among CD-associated genes, and they may represent a starting point for the development of a molecular diagnosis of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Johne's disease, or paratuberculosis, is a chronic fatal ruminant gastroenteritis caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) whose foodborne zoonotic potential and association with Crohn's disease are still under debate. The disease is widespread but its epidemiology and epizootiology remains elusive. Wildlife is suspected to play a major role. After a surge in MAP seroprevalence in Austrian cattle, paratuberculosis was declared a notifiable disease in Austria in 2006. At the same time a rise in MAP cases in wild ruminant populations in the Austrian province of Styria was reported. All five autochthonous ruminants were affected. Genetic analysis of isolates, yielded numerous genotypes (>15) and several multiple strain infections (15%) across host species. Identical MIRU-VNTR profiles were identified in different species and sampling locations. On the other hand varying MIRU-VNTR profiles were revealed at the same location and in conspecifics. Our data, taken together with earlier epidemiological studies on MAP and other mycobacteria, raised concerns about the organisms' ecology. Constraints regarding in vitro culture of this highly fastidious organism potentially bias our current understanding of its epidemiology. We suggest that MAP infections could be polyclonal and question the informative value of genotyping a single MAP colony derived from a single specimen for epidemiological analysis of MAP.},

   abstract = {The emerging role of vitamin D as a regulator of both innate and adaptive immune responses has encouraged the investigation of its role in the pathogenesis of a variety of autoimmune conditions including the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Animal models consistently demonstrate that vitamin D significantly impacts on the modulation of astrointestinal inflammation, while epidemiological and observational data show an inverse relationship between vitamin D status and the onset/progression of Crohn's disease as well as the development of colorectal cancer. As vitamin D supplementation is readily available, at low cost, it is a very attractive potential therapeutic option. The biological plausibility for a role for vitamin D in inflammation modulation, the potential genetic links associated with vitamin D metabolism and the clinical aspects for it in IBD will be discussed.},

   abstract = {The aim of this article is to discuss how the systems science approach can be used to optimize intervention strategies in food animal systems. It advocates the idea that the challenges of maintaining a safe food supply are best addressed by integrating modeling and mathematics with biological studies critical to formulation of public policy to address these challenges. Much information on the biology and epidemiology of food animal systems has been characterized through single-discipline methods, but until now this information has not been thoroughly utilized in a fully integrated manner. The examples are drawn from our current research. The first, explained in depth, uses clinical mastitis to introduce the concept of dynamic programming to optimize management decisions in dairy cows (also introducing the curse of dimensionality problem). In the second example, a compartmental epidemic model for Johne's disease with different intervention strategies is optimized. The goal of the optimization strategy depends on whether there is a relationship between Johne's and Crohn's disease. If so, optimization is based on eradication of infection; if not, it is based on the cow's performance only (i.e., economic optimization, similar to the mastitis example). The third example focuses on food safety to introduce risk assessment using Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Typhimurium. The last example, practical interventions to effectively manage antibiotic resistance in beef and dairy cattle systems, introduces meta-population modeling that accounts for bacterial growth not only in the host (cow), but also in the cow's feed, drinking water and the housing environment. Each example stresses the need to progress toward multi-scale modeling. The article ends with examples of multi-scale systems, from food supply systems to Johne's disease. Reducing the consequences of foodborne illnesses (i.e., minimizing disease occurrence and associated costs) can only occur through an understanding of the system as a whole, including all its complexities. Thus the goal of future research should be to merge disciplines such as molecular biology, applied mathematics and social sciences to gain a better understanding of complex systems such as the food supply chain.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human genome sequencing has enabled the association of phenotypes with genetic loci, but our ability to effectively translate this data to the clinic has not kept pace. Over the past 60 years, pharmaceutical companies have successfully demonstrated the safety and efficacy of over 1,200 novel therapeutic drugs via costly clinical studies. While this process must continue, better use can be made of the existing valuable data. In silico tools such as candidate gene prediction systems allow rapid identification of disease genes by identifying the most probable candidate genes linked to genetic markers of the disease or phenotype under investigation. Integration of drug-target data with candidate gene prediction systems can identify novel phenotypes which may benefit from current therapeutics. Such a drug repositioning tool can save valuable time and money spent on preclinical studies and phase I clinical trials. METHODS: We previously used Gentrepid (http://www.gentrepid.org) as a platform to predict 1,497 candidate genes for the seven complex diseases considered in the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium genome-wide association study; namely Type 2 Diabetes, Bipolar Disorder, Crohn's Disease, Hypertension, Type 1 Diabetes, Coronary Artery Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Here, we adopted a simple approach to integrate drug data from three publicly available drug databases: the Therapeutic Target Database, the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase and DrugBank; with candidate gene predictions from Gentrepid at the systems level. RESULTS: Using the publicly available drug databases as sources of drug-target association data, we identified a total of 428 candidate genes as novel therapeutic targets for the seven phenotypes of interest, and 2,130 drugs feasible for repositioning against the predicted novel targets. CONCLUSIONS: By integrating genetic, bioinformatic and drug data, we have demonstrated that currently available drugs may be repositioned as novel therapeutics for the seven diseases studied here, quickly taking advantage of prior work in pharmaceutics to translate ground-breaking results in genetics to clinical treatments.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity has been associated with a more severe disease course in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and epidemiological data identified dietary fats but not obesity as risk factors for the development of IBD. Crohn's disease is one of the two major IBD phenotypes and mostly affects the terminal ileum. Despite recent observations that high fat diets (HFD) impair intestinal barrier functions and drive pathobiont selection relevant for chronic inflammation in the colon, mechanisms of high fat diets in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease are not known. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of HFD on the development of chronic ileal inflammation in a murine model of Crohn's disease-like ileitis. METHODS: TNF(DeltaARE/WT) mice and wildtype C57BL/6 littermates were fed a HFD compared to control diet for different durations. Intestinal pathology and metabolic parameters (glucose tolerance, mesenteric tissue characteristics) were assessed. Intestinal barrier integrity was characterized at different levels including polyethylene glycol (PEG) translocation, endotoxin in portal vein plasma and cellular markers of barrier function. Inflammatory activation of epithelial cells as well as immune cell infiltration into ileal tissue were determined and related to luminal factors. RESULTS: HFD aggravated ileal inflammation but did not induce significant overweight or typical metabolic disorders in TNF(DeltaARE/WT). Expression of the tight junction protein Occludin was markedly reduced in the ileal epithelium of HFD mice independently of inflammation, and translocation of endotoxin was increased. Epithelial cells showed enhanced expression of inflammation-related activation markers, along with enhanced luminal factors-driven recruitment of dendritic cells and Th17-biased lymphocyte infiltration into the lamina propria. CONCLUSIONS: HFD feeding, independently of obesity, accelerated disease onset of small intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease-relevant mouse model through mechanisms that involve increased intestinal permeability and altered luminal factors, leading to enhanced dendritic cell recruitment and promoted Th17 immune responses.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: 25(OH) vitamin D levels may be low in patients with moderately or severely active inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn's disease and Idiopathic Ulcerative Colitis) but this is less clear in patients with mild or inactive IBD. Furthermore there is limited information of any family influence on 25(OH) vitamin D levels in IBD. As a possible risk factor we hypothesize that vitamin D levels may also be low in families of IBD patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate 25[OH] vitamin D levels in patients with IBD in remission or with mild activity. A second objective is to evaluate whether there are relationships within IBD family units of 25[OH] vitamin D and what are the influences associated with these levels. METHODS: Participants underwent medical history, physical examination and a 114 item diet questionnaire. Serum 25[OH] vitamin D was measured, using a radioimmunoassay kit, (replete >/= 75, insufficient 50-74, deficient < 25-50, or severely deficient < 25 nmol/L). Associations between 25[OH] vitamin D and twenty variables were evaluated using univariate regression. Multivariable analysis was also applied and intrafamilial dynamics were assessed. RESULTS: 55 patients and 48 controls with their respective families participated (N206). 25[OH] vitamin D levels between patients and controls were similar (71.2 +/- 32.8 vs. 68.3 +/-26.2 nmol/L). Vitamin D supplements significantly increased intake but correlation with serum 25[OH] vitamin D was significant only during non sunny months among patients. Within family units, patients' families had mean replete levels (82.3 +/- 34.2 nmol/L) and a modest correlation emerged during sunny months between patients and family (r2 =0.209 p = 0.032). These relationships were less robust and non significant in controls and their families. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild or inactive IBD 25[OH] vitamin D levels are less than ideal but are similar to controls. Taken together collectively, the results of this study suggest that patient family dynamics may be different in IBD units from that in control family units. However contrary to the hypothesis, intra familial vitamin D dynamics do not pose additional risks for development of IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. The two main forms of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. According to the recent concept the disease is caused by a combination of factors, including genetics, immune dysregulation, barrier dysfunction and the change in microbial flora. Environmental factors, such as changes in diet, antibiotic use, smoking or improved domestic hygiene (e.g. eradication of intestinal helminths) probably contribute to the development and increased prevalence of IBD. Dysregulation of mucosal immunity in IBD causes an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines which resulted in uncontrolled intestinal inflammation. Based on extensive research over the last decade, besides the conventional therapy, there are several novel pathways and specific targets, on which focus new therapeutics. New therapeutics aim 1./ to correct genetic susceptibility by stimulating NOD2 expression, TLR3 signaling or inhibition of TLR4 pathway, 2./ to restore the immune dysregulation by inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21), Th1 polarisation (IL-2, IL-12, IL-23, IFN-gamma ), T-cell activation, leukocyte adhesion, as well as by immunostimulation (GM-CSF, G-CSF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-11, IFN-beta-1a), 3./ to restore mucosal barrier function and stimulate mucosal healing by different growth factors, such as GH, EGF, KGF, TGF-beta, VEGF, 4./ to restore the normal bacterial flora by antibiotics, probiotics. However, in spite of these numerous potential targets, the true value and clinical significance of most of the new biologics and molecules are not clear yet.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with its two major forms Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic relapsing disorders leading to inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the precise aetiology of IBD remains unclear, several factors are believed to contribute to disease pathogenesis. Among these, the role of the intestinal microbiota has become more and more appreciated. Evidence from experimental and clinical studies strongly suggests that chronic intestinal inflammation results from a dysregulated immune response towards components of the microbiota in genetically susceptible hosts. The growing perception of the microbiota as a major driver of disease pathogenesis raises the question, if the intestinal microbiota can be used as a therapeutic target in CD. Based on what we know about host microbiota interactions in health and disease, the objective of this review is to address the question if the microbiota holds the key to the future therapy in CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), although whether this impairs immune responsiveness, and is related to disease activity per se, remains unclear. We sought to investigate vitamin D pathways in patients with CD according to measures of inflammation and immune response. METHODS: Prospectively collected samples of a well-characterized cohort of patients with CD were used to measure serum 25(OH)-vitamin D levels by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Related gene expression was determined by polymerase chain reaction in T cells. The effect of vitamin D on the proliferation of isolated CD4 cells was determined. RESULTS: Patients with active CD had lower serum vitamin D levels than those in clinical remission; this measurement was independent of season or reported use of vitamin D supplements. Harvey-Bradshaw Index scores, but not C-reactive protein, correlated with serum vitamin D levels. Gene expression of the vitamin D receptor was higher in peripheral blood T cells from patients with active disease than in those in remission. The proportion of CD25hi CD4 cells from patients with CD increased in the presence of vitamin D. After treatment with infliximab, significant increases in serum vitamin D levels were noted in patients. CONCLUSIONS: Low vitamin D levels are associated with disease activity in CD and increase after infliximab treatment.},

Although HTST treatment leads to inactivation of at least 5 log10 cycles, it might become necessary to enhance the efficacy of HTST by additional treatments such as homogenization if the debate about the role of MAP in Crohn's disease of humans concludes that MAP is a zoonotic agent. This study aimed to determine whether disrupting the clumps of MAP in milk by homogenization during the heat treatment process would enhance the inactivation of MAP. We used HTST pasteurization in a continuous-flow pilot-plant pasteurizer and evaluated the effect of upstream, downstream, and in-hold homogenization on inactivation of MAP. Reduction of MAP at 72 degrees C with a holding time of 28s was between 3.7 and 6.9 log10 cycles, with an overall mean of 5.5 log10 cycles. None of the 3 homogenization modes applied showed a statistically significant additional effect on the inactivation of MAP during HTST treatment.},

   abstract = {The role of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in Crohn's disease in humans has been debated for many years. Milk and milk products have been suggested as possible vectors for transmission since the beginning of this debate, whereas recent publications show that slaughtered cattle and their carcasses, meat, and organs can also serve as reservoirs for MAP transmission. The objective of this study was to generate heat-inactivation data for MAP during the cooking of hamburger patties. Hamburger patties of lean ground beef weighing 70 and 50 g were cooked for 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 min, which were sterilized by irradiation and spiked with three different MAP strains at levels between 10(2) and 10(6) CFU/ml. Single-sided cooking with one flip was applied, and the temperatures within the patties were recorded by seven thermocouples. Counting of the surviving bacteria was performed by direct plating onto Herrold's egg yolk medium and a three-vial most-probable-number method by using modified Dubos medium. There was considerable variability in temperature throughout the patties during frying. In addition, the log reduction in MAP numbers showed strong variations. In patties weighing 70 g, considerable bacterial reduction of 4 log or larger could only be achieved after 6 min of cooking. For all other cooking times, the bacterial reduction was less than 2 log. Patties weighing 50 g showed a 5-log or larger reduction after cooking times of 5 and 6 min. To determine the inactivation kinetics, a log-linear regression model was used, showing a constant decrease of MAP numbers over cooking time.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) is considered as a potential public health threat due to its possible association with Crohn's disease in humans. This study aimed to investigate the survival of Map in ultra-filtered white (UFW) cheese, with special reference to the effect of initial inoculum level, addition of starter culture and salt concentration. Behaviour of Map was monitored during the storage of UFW cheese using F57-quantitative real-time PCR and culture assay. According to the results, higher inoculum level prolongs Map persistence in UFW cheese. Furthermore, the addition of starter culture was found as the main restrictive parameter affecting the survival of Map in UFW cheese. Meanwhile, salt concentration did not accelerate Map inactivation. It was concluded that UFW cheese has potential to support the survival of Map. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study was conducted to investigate the factors that influence the survival of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) during the storage period of ultra-filtered white (UFW) cheese which represents a step forward to meet a critical industry need. Results revealed that the addition of starter culture could restrict the persistence of Map, while Map survival was not affected by higher salt concentration. In addition, persistence of Map was found dose-dependent. It was concluded that in UFW cheese, Map could survive the 60 days of storage period.},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes Johne's disease in ruminants and may contribute to Crohn's disease in humans. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and quantity of MAP in cattle feces and milk in the Iranian context. In addition, we evaluated the effect of cattle age as well as farming system as risk factors contributing to MAP load. For this, a total sample of 373 consisting of 150 cattle feces (CF), 150 individual cow's milk (ICM), as well as 73 bulk-tank milk (BTM) was collected randomly and regardless of the cattle health status. The samples were assayed using F57 quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and culture method. According to the results of qPCR which was found approximately 10 times more sensitive than culture assay, MAP was detected in 68.66% (103/150) of the CF, 12% (18/150) of the ICM and 52.05% (38/73) of the BTM samples. In contrast to the previous reports, the quantity of MAP in the BTM (2.03-5.97 log cfu/50 ml) was statistically (p<0.01) higher than the ICM (0.90-1.97 log cfu/50 ml). Data suggested a direct relation (p<0.01) between the cattle age and the quantity of MAP in the CF samples, while the relation was not statistically significant (p>0.05) for the ICM. In addition, MAP load in the BTM samples obtained from traditional farms was significantly (p<0.01) higher than that of the industrial ones, while the differences in CF and ICM was not significant (p>0.05).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease would benefit from specific targeting of therapeutics to the intestine. We developed a strategy for localized delivery of the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-27, which is synthesized actively in situ by the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis (LL-IL-27), and tested its ability to reduce colitis in mice. METHODS: The 2 genes encoding mouse IL-27 were synthesized with optimal codon use for L lactis and joined with a linker; a signal sequence was added to allow for product secretion. The construct was introduced into L lactis. Colitis was induced via transfer of CD4(+)CD45RB(hi) T cells into Rag(-/-) mice to induce colitis; 7.5 weeks later, LL-IL-27 was administered to mice via gavage. Intestinal tissues were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: LL-IL-27 administration protected mice from T-cell transfer-induced enterocolitis and death. LL-IL-27 reduced disease activity scores, pathology features of large and small bowel, and levels of inflammatory cytokines in colonic tissue. LL-IL-27 also reduced the numbers of CD4(+) and IL-17(+) T cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissue. The effects of LL-IL-27 required production of IL-10 by the transferred T cells. LL-IL-27 was more effective than either LL-IL-10 or systemic administration of recombinant IL-27 in reducing colitis in mice. LL-IL-27 also reduced colitis in mice after administration of dextran sodium sulfate. CONCLUSIONS: LL-IL-27 reduces colitis in mice by increasing the production of IL-10. Mucosal delivery of LL-IL-27 could be a more effective and safer therapy for inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The interaction between a disturbed microbial composition, the intestinal mucosal barrier and the mucosal immune system plays an important role in IBD and its chronicity. It has been indicated that due to the altered microbial composition the balance between T regulatory cells (Treg) and T helper cells (Th) 17 is disturbed, leading to an inflammatory state. The present study shows that oral intake of a specific multi fibre mix (MF), designed to match the fibre content of a healthy diet, counteracts IBD-like intestinal inflammation and weight loss in dextran sodium sulphate treated mice. This reduction in inflammation might be brought about, at least in part, by the MF-induced decrease in inflammatory cytokines, increase in IL-10 and the relative increase in Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Moreover, the Treg percentage in the MLN correlates with the percentage of tolerogenic lamina propria derived CD103+RALDH+dendritic cells in the MLN, suggesting that these play a role in the observed effects. In children with CD exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a widely used safe and effective therapy. Optimizing enteral nutritional concepts with the tested fibre mix, know to modulate the gut microbiota composition, SCFA production and inflammatory status (as indicated by the present study) could possibly further improve efficacy in inducing remission.},

Sixty percent of Crohn's disease patients have sarcopenia. However some inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are obese or suffer from sarcopenic-obesity. IBD patients have many vitamin and nutrient deficiencies, which can lead to important consequences such as hyperhomocysteinemia, which is associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic disease. Nutritional deficiencies in IBD patients are the result of insufficient intake, malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy as well as metabolic disturbances directly induced by the chronic disease and its treatments, in particular corticosteroids. Screening for nutritional deficiencies in chronic disease patients is warranted. Managing the deficiencies involves simple nutritional guidelines, vitamin supplements, and nutritional support in the worst cases.},

Our aim of the present work has been to explore the levels of antibodies (IgG and IgA) raised against extracellular proteins produced by LAB and its association with IBD. We analyzed, by Western-blot and ELISA, the presence of serum antibodies (IgA and IgG) developed against extracellular protein fractions produced by different food bacteria from the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. We used a sera collection consisting of healthy individuals (HC, n = 50), Crohn's disease patients (CD, n = 37), and ulcerative colitis patients (UC, n = 15). Levels of IgA antibodies developed against a cell-wall hydrolase from Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus GG (CWH) were significantly higher in the IBD group (P < 0.002; n = 52). The specificity of our measurements was confirmed by measuring IgA antibodies developed against the CWH peptide 365-VNTSNQTAAVSAS-377. IBD patients appeared to have different immune response to food bacteria. This paper sets the basis for developing systems for early detection of IBD, based on the association of high levels of antibodies developed against extracellular proteins from food and probiotic bacteria.},

   abstract = {Johne's disease (JD) caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is a major threat to the dairy industry and possibly some cases of Crohn's disease in humans. A MAP vaccine that reduced of clinical disease and/or reduced fecal shedding would aid in the control of JD. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the efficacy of 5 attenuated strains of MAP as vaccine candidates compared to a commercial control vaccine using the protocol proposed by the Johne's Disease Integrated Program (JDIP) Animal Model Standardization Committee (AMSC), and (2) to validate the AMSC Johne's disease goat challenge model. Eighty goat kids were vaccinated orally twice at 8 and 10 weeks of age with an experimental vaccine or once subcutaneously at 8 weeks with Silirum(R) (Zoetis), or a sham control oral vaccine at 8 and 10 weeks. Kids were challenged orally with a total of approximately 1.44 x 10(9) CFU divided in two consecutive daily doses using MAP ATCC-700535 (K10-like bovine isolate). All kids were necropsied at 13 months post-challenge. Results indicated that the AMSC goat challenge model is a highly efficient and valid model for JD challenge studies. None of the experimental or control vaccines evaluated prevented MAP infection or eliminated fecal shedding, although the 329 vaccine lowered the incidence of infection, fecal shedding, tissue colonization and reduced lesion scores, but less than the control vaccine. Based on our results the relative performance ranking of the experimental live-attenuated vaccines evaluated, the 329 vaccine was the best performer, followed by the 318 vaccine, then 316 vaccine, 315 vaccine and finally the 319 vaccine was the worst performer. The subcutaneously injected control vaccine outperformed the orally-delivered mutant vaccine candidates. Two vaccines (329 and 318) do reduce presence of JD gross and microscopic lesions, slow progression of disease, and one vaccine (329) reduced fecal shedding and tissue colonization.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Intractable diarrhea of infancy (IDI), a group of prolonged diarrheal disorders, is difficult to diagnose and manage. We documented general features of patients and the causes of IDI. METHODS: The present retrospective study included 60 hospitalized patients with IDI ages 0 to 24 months during January 2000 to December 2010. Detailed history, laboratory and endoscopic findings, diagnoses, and clinical courses were reviewed. Descriptive analyses were used for statistical evaluation. RESULTS: The male/female ratio was 1.4. The median age at onset of diarrhea was 12 days. A total of 70% and 11% of patients were severely and moderately malnourished, respectively. Carbohydrate malabsorption (CM) and food allergies (n = 11, 18% for both) were the most frequent causes. A total of 16 of the patients (27%) did not have a specific diagnosis. The other diagnoses were infections (n = 5), immune-mediated disorders (IMD) (n = 6), congenital enterocyte defects (CED) (n = 3, 5%), short bowel syndrome (n = 2), cystic fibrosis (n = 2), intestinal pseudoobstruction (n = 1), congenital disorder of glycosylation (n = 1), abetalipoproteinemia (n = 1), and proprotein convertase (PC) 1 deficiency (n = 1). Stool calprotectin level was high in 10 of 19 patients with Crohn disease (n = 3, mean 1116 +/- 851 mg/L), food allergy (n = 4, mean 516 +/- 288 mg/L), and undefined etiology (n = 3, mean 616 +/- 780 mg/L). The mean duration of hospitalization was 76 days. CONCLUSIONS: IDI is a heterogeneous group of diarrheal disorders. The most frequent causes were CM and food allergies in our study. Because high levels of calprotectin support inflammation, calprotectin levels may help to discriminate CED and inflammatory causes of IDI.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of vitamin D (VD) concentrations and VD supplementation on health related quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. METHODS: A cohort of 220 IBD patients including 141 Crohn's disease (CD) and 79 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients was followed-up at a tertiary IBD center. A subgroup of the cohort (n = 26) took VD supplements for > 3 mo. Health related quality of life was assessed using the short IBD questionnaire (sIBDQ). VD serum concentration and sIBDQ score were assessed between August and October 2012 (summer/autumn period) and between February and April 2013 (winter/spring period). The mean VD serum concentration and its correlation with disease activity of CD were determined for each season separately. In a subgroup of patients, the effects of VD supplementation on winter VD serum concentration, change in VD serum concentration from summer to winter, and winter sIBDQ score were analyzed. RESULTS: During the summer/autumn and the winter/spring period, 28% and 42% of IBD patients were VD-deficient (< 20 ng/mL), respectively. In the winter/spring period, there was a significant correlation between sIBDQ score and VD serum concentration in UC patients (r = 0.35, P = 0.02), with a trend towards significance in CD patients (r = 0.17, P = 0.06). In the winter/spring period, VD-insufficient patients (< 30 ng/mL) had a significantly lower mean sIBDQ score than VD-sufficient patients; this was true of both UC (48.3 +/- 2.3 vs 56.7 +/- 3.4, P = 0.04) and CD (55.7 +/- 1.25 vs 60.8 +/- 2.14, P = 0.04) patients. In all analyzed scenarios (UC/CD, the summer/autumn period and the winter/spring period), health related quality of life was the highest in patients with VD serum concentrations of 50-59 ng/mL. Supplementation with a median of 800 IU/d VD day did not influence VD serum concentration or the sIBDQ score. CONCLUSION: VD serum concentration correlated with health related quality of life in UC and CD patients during the winter/spring period.},

In this study, immune responses of human epithelial cells to pathogens, either alone or in combination with probiotic bacteria were studied. Industrially prepared Lactobacillus helveticus strain R0052 was first examined by microarray analysis and then compared to broth-grown strains of R0052 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG using quantitative realt-time polymerase chain reaction. Results showed host immune activation responses increased following pathogen exposure, which were differentially ameliorated using probiotics depending on both the preparation of probiotics employed and conditions of exposure. These findings provide additional support for the concept that specific probiotic strains serve as a promising option for use in preventing the risk of enteric bacterial infections.},

   abstract = {Patients have strong beliefs about the role of diet in the cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and in exacerbating or alleviating ongoing symptoms from IBD. The rapid increase in the incidence and prevalence of IBD in recent decades strongly suggests an environmental trigger for IBD, one of which may be dietary patterns. There are several pathways where diet may influence intestinal inflammation, such as direct dietary antigens, altering the gut microbiome, and affecting gastrointestinal permeability. However, data that altering diet can change the natural history of IBD are scarce, and evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD are lacking. Patients, therefore, seek nonmedical resources for dietary guidance, such as patient support groups and unverified sources on the Internet. The aim of this review is to identify patient-targeted dietary recommendations for IBD and to critically appraise the nutritional value of these recommendations. We review patient-targeted dietary information for IBD from structured Internet searches and popular defined diets. Patient-targeted dietary recommendations focus on food restrictions and are highly conflicting. High-quality dietary intervention studies are needed to facilitate creation of evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD.},

In the present study, we investigated the distribution of exogenous pigment throughout the gastrointestinal tract of children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the correlation between their age and the presence and amount of pigment in Peyer patches, and its relation to pediatric IBD. METHODS: Biopsies (upper and lower gastrointestinal tract) from children suspected of having IBD who underwent endoscopy, were reassessed by a blinded, expert pathologist. The amount of pigment in biopsies was scored using a semiquantitative scale (range 0 to +++). RESULTS: A total of 151 children were included: 62 with Crohn disease (CD), 26 with ulcerative colitis, and 63 with non-IBD. In 63 children (42%), deposits of black pigment were found only in biopsies from the terminal ileum, located in Peyer patches. A significant correlation was found between increasing age and the amount of pigment (P = 0.004). Pigment deposits were found significantly less in the patients with CD compared with those in patients with ulcerative colitis and those with non-IBD (26% vs 62% and 49%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for the hypothesis that the amount of pigment, only present in Peyer patches in the terminal ileum, becomes denser with increasing age. Absence of pigment in Peyer patches in a higher number of patients with CD suggests that microparticles may have become involved in the inflammatory process, possibly because of disrupted autophagy.},

   abstract = {The clinical management of Crohn's disease is complicated. Practice guidelines for Crohn's disease recommend that clinicians take into account the disease location, severity, complications, and extra-intestinal manifestations when choosing a treatment strategy. However, no universal treatment strategy exists. The lack of consensus about the best treatment strategy can result in confusion and frustration for the Crohn's disease patient as well as practitioners who treat Crohn's disease patients. Medications are the preferred treatment for Crohn's disease with surgical interventions reserved for complications of disease or evidence of dysplasia. Medical therapy in Crohn's disease targets intestinal inflammation with the intent of altering the natural history of the disease. Corticosteroids and aminosalicylates such as sulfasalazine have been used since the 1950s. Immunomodulators (6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, and methotrexate) have been used for the treatment of Crohn's disease since the 1970s, although use of these medications was not routine until the 1990s. The first biologic tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor, infliximab, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Crohn's disease in adults in 1998. The FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies against TNF-alpha inhibitor also include adalimumab and certolizumab pegol. Another biologic agents used for the treatment of Crohn's disease include natalizumab, a monoclonal antibody against cellular adhesion molecule alpha4-integrin that is FDA-approved for Crohn's disease in adults. Our recent systematic review addressed several Key Questions in the management of Crohn's disease. In that review, we identified several important gaps in the evidence. We used the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing, setting (PICOTS) framework to identify gaps from the evidence in relationship to the populations, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, timing, and settings relevant to treatments for Crohn's disease. Several gaps related to the target population (children, non-white, and risk stratification based on patient characteristics). Other gaps related to interventions and comparisons of interest (step up versus top down treatment and head to head comparisons within and between treatment classes), outcomes of interest (mucosal healing, and patient-reported symptoms), or a timing issue (remission beyond 2 years). The objective of this report is to identify and prioritize existing gaps in the synthesized literature pertaining to pharmacological induction and maintenance of remission for patients with Crohn's disease by engaging stakeholders using a modified Delphi method.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) self-management fits well within a social-cognitive framework. At the heart of social-cognitive theory is self-efficacy, a set of beliefs about one's ability to perform certain tasks. Self-efficacy is a strong predictor of health outcomes in chronic diseases and could serve as an intermediary outcome measure of self-management for pediatric IBD. The aim of this preliminary study was to develop items for the design of a self-efficacy scale specifically for adolescents and young adults with IBD. METHODS: Survey development is an iterative process. As defined by the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines for developing a patient-reported outcome measurement, the first step of this process is to obtain patient input. Using qualitative research methods, adolescents and young adults were recruited from an outpatient pediatric gastroenterology clinic to participate in a semistructured interview. Transcriptions of the recorded interviews were reviewed for themes related to self-efficacy around disease management. A consensus panel of gastroenterologists and health psychologists reviewed the initially constructed items. Those specific items were then reviewed and adjusted by a panel of participants for content and understandability using cognitive interview methods. The resulting 13-item scale is presented here. RESULTS: Nineteen patients and 5 parents participated in the study. The study sample was 42% girls, 79% whites, 74% had Crohn disease, and 79% had not required surgery. Median age was 15 years (range 10-22 years). Theme analysis and expert review yielded 13 items across 4 theoretical domains: managing medical care, managing daily life with IBD, managing emotions, and managing the future with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: A 13-item disease-specific scale has been developed based on patient input to assess self-efficacy around self-management in adolescents with IBD. Efforts to validate this newly designed scale are presently under way.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To identify environmental risk factors for developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children <15 years of age. METHODS: IBD patients and randomly selected healthy controls from a well defined geographical area in Denmark were prospectively recruited in the period 1.1.2007-31.12.2009. Data regarding socioeconomic status, area of residence, living conditions, infections and diet were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 118 IBD patients (59 Crohn's disease (CD), 56 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 IBD unclassified (IBDU)) and 477 healthy controls filled out the questionnaire. The response rates were 91% in patients and 45% in controls, respectively. Several risk factors for IBD were identified: IBD in first degree relatives (IBD: OR (odds ratio): 6.1 (95%CI: 2.5-15.0), CD (OR: 6.8 (2.3-20.2)) and UC (OR: 6.1 (2.3-16.0))); bedroom sharing (IBD: OR: 2.1 (1.0-4.3), CD (OR: 3.6 (1.3-9.4))); high sugar intake (IBD: OR: 2.5 (1.0-6.2), CD (OR: 2.9 (1.0-8.5))); prior admission to a hospital for gastrointestinal infections (IBD: 7.7 (3.1-19.1), CD (7.9 (2.5-24.9)) and UC (7.4 (2.5-21.6))); stressful events (IBD: 1.7 (1.0-2.9)). Protective factors were daily vs. less than daily vegetable consumption (CD: 0.3 (0.1-1.0), UC (0.3 (0.1-0.8))) and whole meal bread consumption (IBD: OR: 0.5 (0.3-0.9), CD (0.4 (0.2-0.9))). An increased risk of diagnosis of CD compared to UC was shown for patients living in more urban areas (OR: 1.3 (1.1-1.6)). CONCLUSION: We identified several risk and protective factors for developing IBD. Studies on the influence of environmental factors are important in our understanding of aetiology and phenotypes of paediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a 25 kDa glycoprotein present in the bodily fluids and tissues. It is secreted by neutrophils, epithelial cells, hepatocytes and adipocytes, and its expression is highly increased in response to cellular stress. The role of NGAL in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in children has thus far not been studied. METHODS: The following groups of children were included: (i) inflammatory bowel disease group, n = 36, aged from 1 to 18 years with Crohn's disease (n = 19) and ulcerative colitis (n = 17); (ii) control group, n = 126; and (iii) disease control group, n = 27, without inflammatory bowel disease, with a food and/or inhalant allergy. RESULTS: Healthy children aged from 1 to 8 years exhibited lower NGAL level than those of 9 to 18 years old (39.0; 18.1-83.7 ng/mL vs 57.6; 28.7-107 ng/mL, P = 0.001). In the younger, but not in the older children, the serum NGAL level correlated with their age, r = 0.334, P = 0.001. In children with inflammatory bowel disease, serum NGAL level was higher (108; 37.3-245 ng/mL) than in healthy (42.0; 18.1-107 ng/mL) and allergic, noninflammatory bowel disease children (49.3; 19.3-107 ng/mL), P = 0.001. Serum NGAL levels in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis children did not correlate with age, gender, disease activity, and indices of the inflammation. CONCLUSION: Serum NAGL levels are highly elevated in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in children compared to the healthy control group. Systematic studies are needed to explain the role of this protein in the inflammatory bowel disease.},

Among the 91,870 women included in the study, we identified 123 incident cases (45 CD, 71 UC, and 7 indeterminate colitis). To assess residential sun exposure, we used a database containing mean daily ultraviolet radiation (UVR) dose for each French county. The relationship between residential sun exposure and risk of incident inflammatory bowel diseases was explored using Cox models. RESULTS: Higher levels of residential sun exposure were associated with a significant decreased risk of CD (hazard ratio [HR] for the third versus the first tertile of UVR dose, 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23-1.01; P for trend = 0.04), but not of UC (HR, 1.21; CI, 0.61-2.11). In women with available data on dietary vitamin D intake, we observed a lower risk of CD with higher residential UVR (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.80; P for trend = 0.01). Dietary vitamin D intake was neither associated with the risk of CD (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.14-1.24; P for trend = 0.14) nor UC (HR, 1.61; CI, 0.61-4.23). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective cohort of women, high residential sunlight exposure was associated with decreased incidence of CD, but not UC.},

   abstract = {NOD2 functions as an intracellular sensor for microbial pathogen and plays an important role in epithelial defense. The loss-of-function mutation of NOD2 is strongly associated with human Crohn's disease (CD). However, the mechanisms of how NOD2 maintains the intestinal homeostasis and regulates the susceptibility of CD are still unclear. Here we found that the numbers of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were reduced significantly in Nod2(-/-) mice and the residual IELs displayed reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. Further study showed that NOD2 signaling maintained IELs via recognition of gut microbiota and IL-15 production. Notably, recovery of IELs by adoptive transfer could reduce the susceptibility of Nod2(-/-) mice to the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Our results demonstrate that recognition of gut microbiota by NOD2 is important to maintain the homeostasis of IELs and provide a clue that may link NOD2 variation to the impaired innate immunity and higher susceptibility in CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease prevalence increases with increasing latitude. Because most vitamin D comes from sunlight exposure and murine models of intestinal inflammation have demonstrated beneficial effects of 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D treatment, we hypothesised that Crohn's disease activity is associated with low vitamin D levels. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 182 CD patients and 62 healthy controls, we measured serum 25-OH vitamin D. Stratified analysis was used to compare 25-OH vitamin D levels with Crohn's disease activity index, C-reactive protein, smoking status, intake of oral vitamin D supplements and seasonal variation in CD patients and healthy controls. RESULTS: Serum 25-OH vitamin D was inversely associated with disease activity: Median 25-OH vitamin D levels of Crohn's disease in remission, mildly, and moderately active diseases evaluated by Crohn's disease activity index were 64, 49, and 21 nmol/l (p<0.01) and by CRP 68, 76, and 35 nmol/l (p<0.05), respectively. Patients who took oral vitamin D supplementation had lower Crohn's disease activity index (p<0.05) and C-reactive protein (p=0.07) than non-users. Crohn's disease patients who smoked had lower vitamin D levels (51 nmol/l) than patients who did not smoke (76 nmol/l), p<0.01. Overall, Crohn's disease patients did not differ from healthy controls regarding 25-OH vitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: Active Crohn's disease was associated with low serum 25-OH vitamin D. Patients who smoked had lower 25-OH vitamin D levels than patients who did not smoke, independently of disease activity.},

This study is a Case - control study, that studied 72 patients with Ulcerative Colitis, after recording history of the disease, colonoscopy and confirmed by biopsy and 72 person without history of colitis. In this study, in order to investigate of food allergy, used of the EUROMMUM kit with an international code number DP3420-1601-11E. We used chi-square and Monte Carlo method for analysis of data. Among UC patients, 30.6% mild, 52.8% moderate and 16.6% of cases were in sever stage. 9.7% of them reported a history of abdominal surgery due to disease. According to the chi-square and Monte Carlo methods, dairy allergy (including: cow milk, cow milk UHT and casein) in UC group was significant (P=0.00). This study indicated that there is significant relationship between UC and cow milk, cow milk UHT and casein. UC patients who are allergic to dairy products and the use of dairy products can increase the severity of UC.},

It has also been shown to have a pivotal role in the development of experimental colitis in mice. The increased expression of CXCL16 has been demonstrated in inflamed lesions of patients with Crohn disease. Our aim was to study the expression of CXCL16 in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Relative quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was applied to explore the gene expressions of CXCL16, its receptor CXCR6, and interleukin 8, an inflammatory marker, in the colonic biopsies of children with active ulcerative colitis (n=19), children with ulcerative colitis in remission (n=9) and children with no inflammatory condition in colon (n=14). RESULTS: An increased expression of CXCL16 in the colonic biopsies of children with ulcerative colitis was found both in active disease (p=0.006) and in remission (p=0.033), when compared to children without inflammatory condition. The gene expressions of interleukin 8 and CXCL16 correlated with each other (rs=0.67, p=0.01). The expression of CXCR6 mRNA was comparable between the study groups (p=0.50). CONCLUSIONS: The gene expression of CXCL16 was increased in patients with ulcerative colitis both in active disease and in remission suggesting an important role of the molecule in the pathogenesis of the condition.},

   abstract = {The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease are rapidly increasing in Western countries and in developed Asian countries. Although biologic agents targeting the immune system have been effective in patients with IBD, cessation of treatment leads to relapse in the majority of patients, suggesting that intrinsic immune dysregulation is an effect, not a cause, of IBD. Dramatic changes in the environment, resulting in the dysregulated composition of intestinal microbiota or dysbiosis, may be associated with the fundamental causes of IBD. Japan now has upgraded water supply and sewerage systems, as well as dietary habits and antibiotic overuse that are similar to such features found in developed Western countries. The purpose of this review article was to describe the association of diet, particularly Japanese food and microbiota, with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: MAP is a suspected zoonotic pathogen and the causative agent of Johne's Disease in cattle and other ruminant animals. With over $1 billion dollars in loss to the dairy industry due to Johne's Disease, efforts to eliminate or reduce MAP from cattle are of importance. The purpose of this study was to determine if daily intake of probiotics could eliminate or reduce Johne's Disease associated symptoms and pathogenesis by MAP. Post infection, animals are often asymptomatic carriers with limited shedding of the pathogen, proving early detection to be difficult. Disease and symptoms often appear 3-4 years after infection with antibiotic treatment proving ineffective. Symptoms include chronic gastrointestinal inflammation leading to severe weight-loss from poor feed and water intake cause a wasting disease. These symptoms are similar to those found in individuals with Crohn's Disease (CD); MAP has been implicated by not proven to be the causative agent of CD. Probiotics administered to livestock animals, including dairy and beef cattle have demonstrated improvements in cattle performance and health. Our objectives included determining the benefits of Lactobacillus animalis (strain name: NP-51) in MAP infected BALB/c mice by evaluating systemic and gastrointestinal response by the host and gut microbiota. Male and female animals were fed 1x106 CFU/g probiotics in sterile, powdered mouse chow daily and infected with 1 x 107 CFU/ml MAP and compared to controls. Animals were evaluated for 180 days to assess acute and chronic stages of disease, with sample collection from animals every 45 days. MAP concentrations from liver and intestinal tissues were examined using real time-PCR methods and the expression of key inflammatory markers were measured during MAP infection (interferon-gamma [IFN-Upsilon], Interleukin-1alpha, IL-12, IL-10, IL-6, and Tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha]). RESULTS: Our results demonstrate administration of probiotics reduces production of IFN-Upsilon and IL-6 while increasing TNF-alpha and IL-17 in chronic disease; healthful immune responses that reduce chronic inflammation associated to MAP infection. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that the immune system's response in the presence of probiotics to MAP contributes towards host health by influencing the activity of the immune system and gut microbial populations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Crohn's disease (CD), the involvement of food antigens in immune responses remains unclear. The objective of this study was to detect immune responses against food antigens in CD patients and examine the mechanism in a mouse model of colitis. METHODS: We enrolled 98 CD patients, 50 ulcerative colitis patients, and 52 healthy controls (HCs) to compare the levels of serum immunoglobulin (Ig)Gs against 88 foods. The presence of serum IgGs against foods was also examined in interleukin (IL)-10 knockout (KO) mice in which CD4(+) T cell activation by antigenic food protein was assessed. Mice transferred with IL-10 KO cells received diets with or without food antigens, and the development of colitis was evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of IgGs against various foods, especially vegetables, grains, and nuts, was significantly higher in CD patients than in HCs. Similarly, the prevalence of IgGs against food proteins was higher in IL-10 KO mice than in BALB/c mice. Beta-conglycinin, identified as an antigenic food proteins in IL-10 KO mice, induced CD4(+) T cell production of interferon-gamma and IL-17 through dendritic cell antigen presentation. Elimination of the food antigens ameliorated the development of colitis in mice without altering the composition of their intestinal microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: In CD colitis mice, intestinal inflammation via CD4(+) T cell hyperactivation was induced by food antigens associated with high serum IgG levels and was ameliorated by the elimination of food antigens. This disrupted immunological tolerance to food antigen, which might act as an exacerbating factor, remains to be elucidated in CD patients.},

   abstract = {Exclusive enteral nutrition is established as an initial therapy to induce remission in active Crohn's disease (CD), especially in children, but the mechanisms of action of this therapy are yet to be fully defined. CEACAM6 protein is an adhesion molecule that is up-regulated in active CD and implicated in the attachment of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) to the gut epithelium. Using the Caco-2 human adenocarcinoma cell line, this study showed that the incubation of human cells with a polymeric formula (PF) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the expression of CEACAM6, and that this effect was most noticeable on the cell surface. Further investigation revealed that PF doubled the release of CEACAM6 protein by Caco-2 cells exposed to PF, and that an increase in release of soluble CEACAM6 inversely correlated with the ability of AIEC to associate with the intestinal epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that the secretion of cell surface-associated proteins acting as releasable decoys may be an aspect of the gut's innate immune response to pathogenic bacteria that is strengthened by PF in the setting of CD.},

   abstract = {Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) activity is upregulated in persons with fibrotic lung diseases secondary to chronic inflammatory conditions like Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. We hypothesized that alpha-diketones associated with fixed obstructive lung disease may activate TLR-4. We utilized a human embryonic kidney cell assay (HEK293) with human TLR-4 receptors to test for potential activation effects of 2,3-butandeione, 2,3-pentanedione, 2,3-hexanedione, and 2,3-heptanedione at test concentrations of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 microM. The assay detects NF-kappaB-induced expression of secreted alkaline phosphatase measured after 16 h incubation by a UV-VIS Spectrometer at 650 nm. Escherichia coli K12 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 0.5 ng/mL served as a positive control and was added with each test compound to evaluate combined effects. None of the tested alpha-diketones were found to exhibit cytotoxicity, agonism, or synergistic effects with LPS in the human TLR-4 assay up to 1000 microM. Screening of 2,3-butanedione for agonist activity using the HEK assay with mouse TLR-4 receptors exhibited cytotoxicity at 1000 microM, but no agonist activity. We conclude that the tested alpha-diketones at relatively high concentrations in vitro do not exhibit TLR-4 agonist or synergistic activity and, therefore, apparently do not directly induce inflammasome activation through this pathway in humans or mice.},

   abstract = {Imbalances in the composition and number of bacteria in the gut microbiota have been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and modulation of the gut microbiota by probiotics and antibiotics in IBD has been an active area of research, with mixed results. This narrative review summarizes the findings of relevant publications identified using the PubMed database. Although antibiotics have been associated with an increased risk of IBD development and flares, several meta-analyses demonstrate that antibiotics are efficacious for the induction of remission and treatment of flares in patients with IBD. Data supporting their use include a large number of antibiotic studies in Crohn's disease and evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, although there are fewer studies of the latter. For Crohn's disease, antibiotics have been shown to be useful for the induction of remission and in the postoperative management of patients undergoing surgery. Additionally, patients with fistulizing disease, particularly perianal, can benefit from antibiotics administered short term. Both antimicrobials and probiotics have been shown to be useful for the treatment of pouchitis. Additional randomized controlled trials are needed to further elucidate the role of bacteria in IBD and to better inform clinicians about appropriate antibiotic therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a measure of disease activity based on symptoms, signs and a laboratory test. The US Food and Drug Administration has indicated that patient reported outcomes (PROs) should be the primary outcome in randomised controlled trials for Crohn's disease (CD). AIM: As no validated PRO exists for CD, to investigate whether CDAI diary card items could be modified for this purpose. METHODS: Data from a trial of rifaximin-extended intestinal release were used to identify cut-points for stool frequency, pain and general well-being using receiver operating characteristic curves with CDAI <150 as criterion. The operating properties of 2- and 3-item PRO were evaluated using data from a trial of methotrexate in CD. Regression analysis determined PRO2 and PRO3 scores that correspond to CDAI-defined thresholds of 150, 220 and 450 and changes of 50, 70 and 100 points. RESULTS: Optimum cut-points for CDAI remission were mean daily stool frequency </=1.5, abdominal pain </=1, and general well-being score of </=1 (areas under the ROC curve 0.79, 0.91 and 0.89, respectively). The effect estimates were similar using 2- and 3-item PROs or CDAI. PRO2 and PRO3 values corresponding to CDAI scores of 150, 220 and 450 points were 8, 14, 34 and 13, 22, 53. The corresponding values for CDAI changes of 50, 70 and 100, were 2, 5, 8 and 5, 9, 14. Responsiveness to change was similar for both PROs. CONCLUSION: Patient reported outcomes derived from CDAI diary items may be appropriate for use in clinical trials for CD.},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes Johne's disease (JD) in ruminants and is shed into the milk of infected cows, which contributes to the controversial discussion about a possible link between MAP and Crohn's disease in humans. The aim of the study was to investigate the risk for the entry of MAP in the food chain via milk from dairy farms with subclinical JD. Therefore, the occurrence of MAP in the milk of a dairy herd with a low prevalence of JD was studied in single and bulk tank milk samples over a period of 23 mo and compared with MAP shedding into feces. Milk, fecal, and blood samples were taken from all cows older than 1.5 yr of age at the beginning and the end of the trial and analyzed for MAP or specific antibodies. In addition, 63 cows (33 MAP infected and 30 MAP noninfected) were selected for monthly sampling. Raw and pasteurized bulk tank milk samples were collected on a monthly basis. The milk samples were tested for MAP by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), and the fecal samples were tested for bacterial shedding by qPCR or solid culture. Based on the results of the herd investigations, the prevalence of cows shedding MAP was around 5%; no cases of clinical JD were observed during the study period. The results of the ELISA showed high variation, with 2.1 to 5.1% positive milk samples and 14.9 to 18.8% ELISA-positive blood samples. Monthly milk sampling revealed low levels of MAP shedding into the individual milk samples of both MAP-infected and noninfected cows, with only 13 cows shedding the bacterium into milk during the study period. Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis was not detected by qPCR in any raw or pasteurized bulk tank milk sample throughout the study. A significant positive association could be found between MAP shedding into milk and feces. From the results of the present study, it can be concluded that MAP is only shed via milk in a small proportion of cows with subclinical JD for a limited period of time and is diluted below the detection level of qPCR within the bulk tank milk of these herds. These findings indicate that dairy herds subclinically infected with JD pose only a minor source for human MAP consumption with milk and milk products.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, involves chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Previously, Sasa quelpaertensis leaves have been shown to mediate anti-inflammation and anti-cancer effects, although it remains unclear whether Sasa leaves are able to attenuate inflammation-related intestinal diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of Sasa quelpaertensis leaf extract (SQE) using an in vitro co-culture model of the intestinal epithelial environment. MATERIALS/METHODS: An in vitro co-culture system was established that consisted of intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce inflammation. RESULTS: Treatment with SQE significantly suppressed the secretion of LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-6, and IL-1beta in co-cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages. In addition, expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were down-regulated in response to inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation by SQE. Compared with two bioactive compounds that have previously been identified in SQE, tricin and P-coumaric acid, SQE exhibited the most effective anti-inflammatory properties. CONCLUSIONS: SQE exhibited intestinal anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting various inflammatory mediators mediated through nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-kB) activation. Thus, SQE has the potential to ameliorate inflammation-related diseases, including IBD, by limiting excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Vitamin D has immune modulating effects and normal to high levels might be correlated with less severe Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to review seasonal vitamin D levels in CD patients in correlation with disease activity. METHODS: CD patients were identified from an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) database and given two questionnaires enquiring about vitamin D supplementation, sun exposure, sunblock application and symptoms to complete the CDAI. Participants were examined and serum 25-OH vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and haematocrit were determined in winter (06/2011-09/2011) and summer (12/2011-03/2012). Patients taking vitamin D supplements or with extensive small bowel resection were excluded. RESULTS: 32 patients (19 women, mean age 39 plus or minus 16 years, range 18-73 years), from Dunedin, New Zealand (45 degrees 52' S, 170 degrees 30' E) consented to participate in the study. Of these, three took vitamin D supplements and were excluded. In winter 76% of the participants had serum 25(OH)D levels classified as deficient (<50 nmol/L) and all of them had insufficient 25(OH)D levels (<75 nmol/L). In summer, serum 25(OH)D levels were deficient only in 10% but insufficient in 55% of the participants. Mean serum 25(OH)D level was 35.9 nmol/L (norm 50-150nmol/L) in winter (range 5-67, SD 17.5) and 69.6 nmol/L in summer (range 13-119, SD 19.0) (p<0.0005). There was no significant difference in the seasonal levels of serum 25(OH)D between male and female participants (p=0.601). Mean CDAI score was 103.9 in winter (range -10-262, SD 76.9) and 90.2 in summer (range -13-331, SD 84.0) (p=0.365). A mixed-effects regression analysis showed no statistically significant correlation between seasonal levels of serum 25(OH)D and CDAI (p=0.612) among our study participants. CONCLUSION: Suboptimal levels of serum 25(OH)D were found in the majority of our study participants particularly in winter and they would benefit from supplementation. Our study showed no statistically significant correlation between seasonal serum 25(OH)D levels and CD activity. Given the limitations of the study, the role of 25(OH)D as a predictor of disease activity could not be clearly concluded.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory, relapsing, and progressive condition that leads to bowel damage and subsequent stricturing or penetrating complications. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha antagonists (e.g., infliximab) can achieve sustained remission in CD. However, a paradox exists as to whether use of these medications, which effectively treat psoriasis, also confer risk of developing psoriasiform lesions. METHODS: Data from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (2004-2011) were analyzed. Adverse event reports for the TNF-alpha antagonists infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab were reviewed. Primary "control" drugs examined included the non-CD drugs propranolol and lithium because of their recognized association with risk of psoriasis and the nonbiological CD drug mesalamine. Proportional reporting ratios for psoriasis adverse events were calculated for TNF-alpha antagonists versus control drugs. RESULTS: From more than 13 million reports in Adverse Event Reporting System, the biological group included 5432 reports with psoriasis listed (infliximab = 1789; adalimumab = 3475; and certolizumab = 168) compared with just 88 psoriasis reports for the control group (propranolol = 24; mesalamine = 24; and lithium = 40). Compared with control drugs, the psoriasis proportional reporting ratios for TNF-alpha antagonists were as follows: infliximab (6.61), adalimumab (12.13), and certolizumab (5.43) (P < 0.0001). The aggregate "class" proportional reporting ratio for all TNF-alpha antagonists versus control drugs was 9.24 (P < 0.0001). Similar results were observed when psoriasis reports were compared between TNF-alpha antagonists and other drugs used to treat CD, including azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, corticosteroids, ciprofloxacin, and the antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSIONS: Data from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System suggest that TNF-alpha antagonists used in the treatment of CD confer an increased risk of psoriasiform adverse events.},

Recent advances have linked microbiota dysbiosis to conditions ranging from Crohn's disease to cancer. The restoration or strengthening of the intestinal microbiota through diet-based approaches such as probiotics and prebiotics has been proposed for combating the onset or progression of these diseases. In this review, we highlight the importance of postbiotics for the manipulation of the intestinal microbiota, with special emphasis on systems biology computational tools and targeted metabolomics for the rational discovery and identification of these bioactive molecules. The identification of novel postbiotics and the pathways responsible for their production should lead to improved mechanistic understanding of the role that specific probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics have in restoring intestinal microbiota composition and function.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) constitute the two major groups of idiopathic disorders in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Environmental factors, genetic factors and immune responses have been considered as the major etiology of IBD. Despite the diversified pathogenesis of the disease, no guaranteed curative therapeutic regimen has been developed so far. This review summarizes the knowledge on the pathophysiology and current treatment approaches of IBD. Since IBD is caused by excessive and tissue- disruptive inflammatory reactions of the gut wall, down-regulation of the immune responses may allow the damaged mucosa to heal and reset the physiological functions of the gut back to normal. Current pharmacotherapy through modulation of neutrophil-derived factors, cytokines, adhesion molecules and reactive oxygen/nitrogen metabolites has been utterly described. Categories of treatment modalities include corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, antibiotics, probiotics, and a series of unique novel agents. The use of anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody (Infliximab), recombinant anti-inflammatory cytokines and related gene therapy has been covered. In addition, discussions on dietary supplementation and heparin treatment are also included. The anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory potential of investigational agents such as nicotine and the filtered protective compounds from tobacco smoke, as well as active herbal medicinal compounds were tested in our previous experimental works, whereas promising findings have been presented here. With the discovery of novel target-oriented agents, more effective and relatively harmless approaches of IBD therapy could be established to achieve a curative outcome. Indeed, more experimental and clinical studies are needed to confirm the relevance of these therapies.},

Mesenteric adipose tissue hypertrophy and creeping fat are characteristic features of CD. The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of visceral fat for the differential diagnosis of CD and ITB. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 50 patients with findings of CD or ITB between January 2005 and July 2008. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed on all subjects during their first evaluation. The abdominal fat area was assessed using quantitative abdominal CT. RESULTS: The ratio of visceral fat to total fat (VF/TF) was significantly higher in male CD patients than in male ITB patients. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat (VF/SF) was also higher in CD patients than in patients with ITB. For a VF/TF cut-off value of 0.46, the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CD were 42.1% and 93.3% respectively, with positive and negative predictive values of 88.9% and 56.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Measurement of the abdominal fat area using CT can be clinically useful for the differential diagnosis of CD and ITB.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the general population and in patients with chronic diseases has increased markedly in recent decades. We aimed to determine the prevalence, type, and predictors of oral CAM use among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with the general population in a large, population-based, case-control study. METHODS: Overall, 1370 patients with IBD and 598 control subjects in Canterbury, New Zealand, were recruited. Environmental and phenotypic data were obtained through a questionnaire and case note review. Predictors of oral CAM use were identified using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: In the previous year, 44.1% of patients with IBD and 42.3% of control subjects used oral CAM (odds ratio [OR], 1.078; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.885-1.312). The types of oral CAM used most frequently were vitamins (Crohn's disease [CD], 25.2%; ulcerative colitis, 23.7%; control subjects, 24.9%), followed by herbs (CD 15.1%, ulcerative colitis 15.2%, control subjects 12.8%), and dietary supplements (CD, 8.5%; ulcerative colitis 12.6%, control subjects 12.1%). Female gender (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.25-2.08), younger age (P = 0.005), higher education (P = 0.002), higher income (P = 0.04), being a vegetarian (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.97-6.48) and a middle social class at birth (P = 0.024) were independent predictors of oral CAM use in patients with IBD. Disease phenotype was not associated with oral CAM use. In control subjects, female gender (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.85-3.86), higher education (P = 0.003) and a diagnosis of asthma (P = 0.017) predicted oral CAM use. CONCLUSIONS: Oral CAM use is common in, and does not differ between, patients with IBD and the general population in Canterbury, New Zealand. Socio-demographic factors, and not disease phenotype, predict oral CAM use in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {Studies of the roles of microbial communities in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have reached an important milestone. A decade of genome-wide association studies and other genetic analyses have linked IBD with loci that implicate an aberrant immune response to the intestinal microbiota. More recently, profiling studies of the intestinal microbiome have associated the pathogenesis of IBD with characteristic shifts in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, reinforcing the view that IBD results from altered interactions between intestinal microbes and the mucosal immune system. Enhanced technologies can increase our understanding of the interactions between the host and its resident microbiota and their respective roles in IBD from both a large-scale pathway view and at the metabolic level. We review important microbiome studies of patients with IBD and describe what we have learned about the mechanisms of intestinal microbiota dysfunction. We describe the recent progress in microbiome research from exploratory 16S-based studies, reporting associations of specific organisms with a disease, to more recent studies that have taken a more nuanced view, addressing the function of the microbiota by metagenomic and metabolomic methods. Finally, we propose study designs and methodologies for future investigations of the microbiome in patients with inflammatory gut and autoimmune diseases in general.},

   abstract = {While the etiological underpinnings of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are highly complex, it has been noted that both clinical and pathophysiological similarities exist between IBD and both asthma and non-pulmonary allergic phenomena. In this review, several key points on common biomarkers, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and nutritional and probiotic interventions for both IBD and non-pulmonary allergic diseases are discussed. Histamine and mast cell activity show common behaviors in both IBD and in certain allergic disorders. IgE also represents a key immunoglobulin involved in both IBD and in certain allergic pathologies, though these links require further study. Probiotics remain a critically important intervention for both IBD subtypes as well as multiple allergic phenomena. Linked clinical phenomena, especially sinonasal disease and IBD, are discussed. In addition, nutritional interventions remain an underutilized and promising therapy for modification of both allergic disorders and IBD. Recommending new mothers breastfeed their infants, and increasing the duration of breastfeeding may also help prevent both IBD and allergic diseases, but requires more investigation. While much remains to be discovered, it is clear that non-pulmonary allergic phenomena are connected to IBD in a myriad number of ways and that the discovery of common immunological pathways may usher in an era of vastly improved treatments for patients.},

Probiotics interfere with local and systemic immune reactions and thus exert an influence on the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa. Therefore, attempting inflammatory bowel disease treatment with probiotics seems reasonable. In fact, a growing number of trials have studied the therapeutic effects in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Promising results have been found and in some, indications such as maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis and pouchitis guidelines recommend therapy with probiotics already today. However, many open questions still remain and the urgent need for high-quality trials requires much more research in the future.},

The effect of bowel inflammation on HKG remains unknown. Expression stability of 15 HKG (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, GUSB, HPRT1, IPO8, MRPL19, PGK1, PPIA, RPLP0, RPS23, SDHA, TBP, UBC, and YWHAZ) in 166 bowel specimens (91 normal, 35 cancerous, and 40 inflamed) was ranked by coefficients of variation (CV%) or using dedicated software: geNorm and NormFinder. The RPS23, PPIA, and RPLP0 were top-ranked, whereas IPO8, UBC and TBP were the lowest-ranked HKG across inflamed/cancerous/normal colonic tissues. The pairs RPS23/RPLP0, PGK1/MRPL19, or PPIA/RPLP0 were optimal reference by CV%, NormFinder, and geNorm, respectively. Colon inflammation affected HKG more pronouncedly than cancer with ACTB significantly down- and B2M upregulated. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), different genes were top-ranked in a large and small bowel, whereas TBP, UBC, and IPO8 were lowest-ranked in both. For patients with IBD at large, RPS23/PPIA, PGK1/MRPL19, and PPIA/RPLP0 were found optimal by CV%, NormFinder, and geNorm, respectively. ACTB and B2M expression was related to CRC stage and positively correlated with clinical activity of IBD. Although GAPDH was upregulated neither in CRC nor IBD, it tended to positively correlate with tumor depth and Crohn's disease activity index. Normalizing against GAPDH affected experimental conclusions in a small but not large bowel. Bowel inflammation significantly affects several classic HKG. The pair PPIA/RPLP0 is a common optimal reference for studies encompassing tissues sampled from colorectal cancer and IBD patients. Using ACTB or B2M is not recommended.},

This review covers the anti-inflammatory roles of fibers using results from human epidemiological observations, clinical trials, and animal studies. Fiber has body weight-related anti-inflammatory activity. With its lower energy density, a diet high in fiber has been linked to lower body weight, alleviating obesity-induced chronic inflammation evidenced by reduced amounts of inflammatory markers in human and animal studies. Body weight-unrelated anti-inflammatory activity of fiber has also been extensively studied in animal models in which the type and amount of fiber intake can be closely monitored. Fermentable fructose-, glucose-, and galactose-based fibers as well as mixed fibers have shown systemic and local intestinal anti-inflammatory activities when plasma inflammatory markers and tissue inflammation were examined. Similar anti-inflammatory activities have also been demonstrated in some human studies that controlled total fiber intake. The anti-inflammatory activities of synbiotics (probiotics plus fiber) were reviewed as well, but there was no convincing evidence indicating higher efficacy of synbiotics compared with that of fiber alone. Adverse effects have not been observed with the amount of fiber intake or supplementation used in studies, although patients with Crohn's disease may be more sensitive to inulin intake. Several possible mechanisms that may mediate the body weight-unrelated anti-inflammatory activity of fibers are discussed based on the in vitro and in vivo evidence. Fermentable fibers are known to affect the intestinal microbiome. The immunomodulatory role of the intestinal microbiome and/or microbial metabolites could contribute to the systemic and local anti-inflammatory activities of fibers.},

Vegetables, especially Brassicaceae, are often shunned by people with CD because of the negative effects they are alleged to have on their symptoms. Brassicaceae supply key nutrients which are necessary to meet recommended daily intakes. We sought to identify the candidate genes involved in the beneficial or adverse effects of Brassicaceae most commonly eaten, as reported by the New Zealand adults from the "Genes and Diet in Inflammatory Bowel disease Study" based in Auckland. An analysis of associations between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the beneficial or adverse effects of the ten most commonly eaten Brassicaceae was carried out. A total of 37 SNPs were significantly associated with beneficial effects (p = 0.00097 to 0.0497) and 64 SNPs were identified with adverse effects (p = 0.0000751 to 0.049). After correcting for multiple testing, rs7515322 (DIO1) and rs9469220 (HLA) remained significant. Our findings show that the tolerance of some varieties of Brassicaceae may be shown by analysis of a person's genotype.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review for Complementary and Alternative Medicine [CAM] as defined by the National Institute of Health in Inflammatory Bowel Disease [IBD], ie Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC], with the exception of dietary and nutritional supplements, and manipulative therapies. METHODS: A computerized search of databases [Cochrane Library, Pubmed/Medline, PsychINFO, and Scopus] through March 2014 was performed. We screened the reference sections of original studies and systematic reviews in English language for CAM in IBD, CD and UC. Randomized controlled trials [RCT] and controlled trials [CT] were referred and assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: A total of: 26 RCT and 3 CT for herbal medicine, eg aloe-vera gel, andrographis paniculata, artemisia absinthium, barley foodstuff, boswellia serrata, cannabis, curcumin, evening primrose oil, Myrrhinil intest(R), plantago ovata, silymarin, sophora, tormentil, wheatgrass-juice and wormwood; 1 RCT for trichuris suis ovata; 7 RCT for mind/body interventions such as lifestyle modification, hypnotherapy, relaxation training and mindfulness; and 2 RCT in acupuncture; were found. Risk of bias was quite heterogeneous. Best evidence was found for herbal therapy, ie plantago ovata and curcumin in UC maintenance therapy, wormwood in CD, mind/body therapy and self-intervention in UC, and acupuncture in UC and CD. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary and alternative therapies might be effective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases; however, given the low number of trials and the heterogeneous methodological quality of trials, further in-depth research is necessary.},

They were rare before the 1930's but the incidence has been increasing in both developed and developing countries. We have recently reported that the incidence in Nova Scotia, the area with one of the highest reported burden globally, is decreasing since 1997. We postulate that this decrease may be due to the addition of folate to cereals. This was mandated in 1998 but the process of fortification began in 1997. There is circumstantial evidence from epidemiology studies that a diet deficient in folate may have contributed to the global rise in these diseases. This hypothesis, if proven to be correct, has important implications for the prevention and treatment of these diseases.},

These included the roles of enteral nutrition to induce remission, food re-introduction diets to structure food re-introduction and maintain remission, and dietary management of stricturing disease, as well as whether probiotics or prebiotics induce or maintain remission. A comprehensive literature search was conducted and relevant studies from January 1985 to November 2009 were identified using the electronic database search engines CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science. Evidence statements, recommendations, practical considerations and research recommendations were developed. RESULTS: Fifteen research papers were critically appraised and the evidence formed the basis of these guidelines. Although corticosteroids appear to be more effective, enteral nutrition (elemental or non-elemental) can be offered as an alternative option to induce disease remission. After a course of enteral nutrition, food re-introduction diets may be useful to structure food re-introduction and help maintain disease remission. Dietary fibre is contraindicated in the presence of strictures as a result of the risk of mechanical obstruction. The use of probiotics and prebiotics is not currently supported. CONCLUSIONS: As an alternative to corticosteroids, evidence supports enteral nutrition to induce disease remission. Food re-introduction diets provide structure to food re-introduction and help maintain disease remission. These guidelines aim to reduce variation in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Zinc is an essential micronutrient playing fundamental roles in cellular metabolism. It acts mostly through binding a wide range of proteins, thus affecting a broad spectrum of biological processes, which include cell division, growth and differentiation. Full annotation of zinc-binding proteins showed them to represent about 10 % of the human proteome, with over 300 enzymes containing zinc ions within their catalytic domains. Also, hundreds of key regulatory proteins, including transcription factors, require zinc for their activity. In this study, the whole set of zinc-binding proteins together with their direct interactors was listed and defined as the zinc proteome (ZNP). We interrogated pathway analysis tools to identify the cellular processes that are predicted to be affected by zinc availability. Network and functional enrichment analyses highlighted biological processes potentially affected by deregulated zinc homeostasis. This computational approach was also tested on a real case study: The possible involvement of ZNP network proteins in Crohn's disease pathogenesis was assessed on genes transcriptionally regulated in the intestine of patients affected by this condition. The analysis produced a network of pathways likely to be influenced by zinc and associated with Crohn's disease. These results highlight a central role for zinc in the tissue remodeling process which occurs upon gut inflammation, pointing at novel disease pathways whose effect could be worsened by zinc dyshomeostasis and impaired zinc fluxes in specific damaged areas. Overall, our computational approach could provide novel insights into pathological conditions and could therefore be used to drive mechanistic research in under-investigated fields of research. An interactive version of the determined ZNP network is available at URL http://93.63.165.11/ZNnetwork/ .},

   abstract = {It is important to have clear goals for treating inflammatory bowel disease in clinical practice and in research. Conventional end points for trials in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have been based on composite indices, such as the Mayo Clinic Score and the Crohn's Disease Activity Index; these indices incorporate symptoms, signs, and findings from laboratory tests and sometimes endoscopic assessments. Although definitions of clinical response and remission have been based on these indices for regulatory purposes, they are difficult to apply to practice because they are complex and not intuitive to clinicians. This has caused a disconnect between clinical trials and practice. Recently, the use of composite indices in trials has been reevaluated in Food and Drug Administration-sponsored Gastroenterology Regulatory Endpoints and the Advancement of Therapeutics workshops due to concerns about the validity of the indices. Alternative measures of outcome and definitions of response are being developed. Patient-reported outcomes are psychometric instruments created and defined by patients to quantify symptoms. A combination of end points, comprising patient-reported outcomes and objective evaluation of inflammation by endoscopy, offers a clinically meaningful and scientifically valid alternative to existing composite indices. Unlike composite indices, response definitions based on endoscopy and patient-reported outcomes can be readily applied in practice. This convergence of outcome assessment in clinical trials and practice could expedite implementation of "treat-to-target" algorithms, in which therapy is progressively intensified until a specific treatment goal is reached. This approach could improve patient care by reducing rates of disease-related complications, surgery, and hospitalization.},

Recent evidence suggests that CD may involve genetic or environmental factors that impair the normal innate immune system's ability to contain bacteria to the lumen. Multiple dietary components may impact on the resident flora, diminish or damage the mucous layer, increase intestinal permeability or increase the ability of pathobionts to adhere to epithelial cells or translocate across the epithelial barrier.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Robust evaluation of induction therapies using both clinical and inflammatory outcomes in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) are sparse. We attempted to evaluate clinical, inflammatory, and composite outcomes of induction of remission therapies (normal C reactive protein [CRP] remission) in a large pediatric prospective multicenter study. METHODS: Patients enrolled at diagnosis into the growth relapse and outcomes with therapy in Crohn's disease study were evaluated for disease activity, CRP, and fecal calprotectin at 8, 12 and 52 weeks after starting treatment. The primary endpoint was week-12 steroid-free remission defined by pediatric Crohn's disease activity index and CRP <0.5 mg/dL. The protocol required tapering off corticosteroids by week 11. RESULTS: We analyzed 222 patients (mean age, 12.9 +/- 3.2 yr) main evaluated treatment options included: 5-ASA (n = 29), exclusive enteral nutrition (n = 43), and corticosteroids (n = 114). Clinical remission at week 12 was achieved in 155 (73%) patients; both exclusive enteral nutrition and steroids were associated with normal CRP remission at week 12, although in a post hoc subgroup analysis exclusive enteral nutrition was superior in mild-to-moderate disease for this outcome. Among those in steroid-free remission in week 12, normal CRP predicted 1-year sustained remission (86% for normal CRP versus 61% for elevated CRP; P = 0.02). Baseline severity and early immunomodulation were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Normal CRP steroid-free remission at week 12 was impacted by type of induction therapy, but not by early immunomodulation. It was associated with more corticosteroids-free remission at week 52 and a trend for less relapses.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mesenteric fat plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD), and a higher ratio of visceral fat area (VFA) to subcutaneous fat area (SFA) is related to complicated disease status. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective treatment option for patients with CD, and the aims of this study were to assess the effects of EEN on abdominal fat in patients with CD. METHODS: Patient data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. The SFA and VFA were measured in 38 patients with CD before and after 8-week EEN therapy, and the mesenteric fat index (MFI), defined as the ratio of VFA to SFA, was calculated. The correlations between MFI and CD activity index and C-reactive protein level were also evaluated. RESULTS: The median age of the patients in our study was 29 years, and the median duration of disease was 3.05 years. Both VFA (P = 0.029) and MFI (P = 0.021) were significantly decreased in patients after EEN, but no significant change was observed in SFA (P = 0.335). MFI was significantly correlated with CD activity index (r = 0.523, P = 0.001) and C-reactive protein (r = 0.634, P < 0.0001) in patients with active CD before EEN, although no positive correlations were observed in patients after EEN treatment. CONCLUSIONS: EEN induction therapy was associated with a significant decrease in VFA in patients with CD, and MFI was significantly correlated with CD activity index and C-reactive protein in active CD. Thus, our data reveal additional beneficial therapeutic mechanisms of enteral nutrition treatment in CD.},

As neither medical nor surgical therapy provides a cure for Crohn's disease, the primary goals of therapy are to induce and maintain remission and prevent complications. As a biologic agent, infliximab, a monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor, is indicated for refractory luminal and fistulizing Crohn's disease that does not respond to other medical therapies or surgery. Infliximab has proven to be very effective for inducing and maintaining remission in Crohn's disease; however, infliximab treatment has several potential complications. Here, we report a case of free perforation following a therapeutic response after an initial dose of infliximab for Crohn's disease. This is the first case report describing a free perforation in a Crohn's disease patient after an initial dose of infliximab.},

IBD has been reported an increased prevalence of low bone mass. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the nutritional status and to investigate the correlation between bone mineral density (BMD) and nutrient factors in patients with IBD. METHODS: A total of 41 subjects were classified into normal group (n=21) and malnourished group (n=20) by the subjective global assessment result. We surveyed the dietary habit, nutrient intake, and BMD. RESULTS: Subjects' average age was 36.7 years old, and included 26 ulcerative colitis and 15 Crohn's disease. The serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher and serum calcium was significantly lower in the malnourished group. Lower bone density subjects were more in the malnourished group but no significant difference. Intake of energy, protein, carbohydrate, fiber, iron, sodium, potassium, zinc, vitamin B6, vitamin C and folate were significantly lower in the malnourished group. The BMD of malnourished group showed correlation with triceps skin fold thickness (TSF), CRP, dietary calcium, phosphorous, iron, animal iron, zinc and vitamin. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that adequate intake of nutrients is important to prevent bone loss and systemic education programs are need for IBD patients.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Vitamin D has an important role in the immune regulation. Vitamin D is essential for innate and adaptive immune systems and it plays a significant role in the formation of immune tolerance, as well. AIM: Vitamin D deficiency has been observed in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases in Western Europe, but there is no data available from Eastern Europe. METHOD: The study included 169 patients with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: The median vitamin D level was 22.7+/-10.6 ng/ml. Only 20% of the patients had adequate vitamin D level (>30 ng/ml), 52% had vitamin D insufficiency (15-30 ng/ml), and 28% of them had severe vitamin D deficiency (<15 ng/ml). Vitamin D concentration failed to correlate with clinical activity indexes (partial Mayo score: r = -0.143; Crohn's disease activity index: r = -0.253) and with inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein: r = 0.008; erythrocyte sedimentation rate: r = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Since vitamin D deficiency can be frequently observed in Hungarian patients with inflammatory bowel disease, its level should be tested in these patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Bacteria play an important role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Unlike in Crohn's disease (CD), in which dysbiosis has been better characterised, in ulcerative colitis (UC), only small cohorts have been studied and showed conflicting data. Therefore, we evaluated in a large cohort if the microbial signature described in CD is also present in UC, and if we could characterise predominant dysbiosis in UC. To assess the functional impact of dysbiosis, we quantified the bacterial metabolites. DESIGN: The predominant microbiota from 127 UC patients and 87 age and sex-matched controls was analysed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Differences were quantitatively validated using real-time PCR. Metabolites were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Based on DGGE analysis, the microbial signature previously described in CD was not present in UC. Real-time PCR analysis revealed a lower abundance of Roseburia hominis (p<0.0001) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p<0.0001) in UC patients compared to controls. Both species showed an inverse correlation with disease activity. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were reduced in UC patients (p=0.014), but no direct correlation between SCFA and the identified bacteria was found. CONCLUSIONS: The composition of the fecal microbiota of UC patients differs from that of healthy individuals: we found a reduction in R hominis and F prausnitzii, both well-known butyrate-producing bacteria of the Firmicutes phylum. These results underscore the importance of dysbiosis in IBD but suggest that different bacterial species contribute to the pathogenesis of UC and CD.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES: Focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates are found in the upper gastrointestinal involvement of Crohn's disease, and may reflect an underlying defective innate immunity. These features, however, are also described in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection. The role of these gastric abnormalities in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease was assessed in a population with high prevalence of H. pylori infection. METHODS: Thirty-seven Crohn's disease, 26 ulcerative colitis, and 30 control patients were included. The H. pylori status was evaluated by the rapid urease test and histology. The presence of focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates was recorded. RESULTS: Focally enhanced gastritis was present in 24% of Crohn's disease patients, 4% of ulcerative colitis patients and 11.5% of controls, presenting an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn's disease of 24% and 88%, respectively. Macrophage microaggregates were found in all groups, but were only detected in ulcerative colitis and controls in association with H. pylori infection, with an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn's disease of 61% and 69%, respectively. In the absence of H. pylori infection, focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates were significantly associated with Crohn's disease (P<0.02 and P = 0.001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Focally gastritis and macrophage microaggregates are suggestive of Crohn's disease only in H. pylori-negative specimens.},

   abstract = {During nutrient deprivation, autophagy provides the constituents required to maintain the metabolism essential for survival. Recently, genome-wide association studies have identified genetic determinants for susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD) such as ATG16L1 and IRGM that are involved in the autophagy pathway. Both disease-carrying NOD2 mutations and ATG16L1 mutations may result in impairment of autophagy. Impairment in autophagy results in impaired clearance of microbes. Ileal CD is associated with Paneth cell loss of function such as decreased production of alpha-defensins, which may arise from mutations in NOD2 or autophagy genes. Nutrients are able to modify several cellular pathways and in particular autophagy. We summarize the contribution of a variety of dietary components to activate autophagy. Understanding the crosstalk between nutrients and autophagy in the intestine may provide novel targets that have therapeutics potential in intestinal inflammation. Nutrient activation of autophagy may contribute to restoring the Paneth cell loss of function in ileal CD.},

A mutated and dysregulated form of JAK2, a tyrosine kinase, is associated with several diseases including Crohn's disease. Using an in vitro, time-resolved fluorescence (TR-FRET) assay, we tested 49 different types of food extracts, plus 10 concentrated fractions of increasing hydrophobicity from each extract, to find foods containing JAK2 inhibitors. The food extracts tested included grains, meat, fish, shellfish, dairy products, herbs, mushrooms, hops, fruits and vegetables. Several fruits were potent inhibitors of JAK2: blackberry, boysenberry, feijoa, pomegranate, rosehip and strawberry, which all contain ellagitannins, known inhibitors of kinases. These fruits are in the Rosales and Myrtales plant orders. No other foods gave >1% of the maximal JAK2 inhibitory activities of these fruits. AMPK, a sensor and regulator of energy metabolism in cells, is a serine-threonine kinase which is reported to be activated by various flavonoid phytochemicals. Using a TR-FRET assay, we tested various fruit extracts for AMPK activation and inhibition. Ellagitannin containing foods scored highly as AMPK inhibitors. Despite several reports of AMPK activation in whole cells by phytochemicals, no extracts or pure compounds activated AMPK in our assay.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Research has been carried out in various countries into the nutritional adequacy of the GFD in terms of macro- and micronutrients, mostly presenting conflicting results. However, no data for Germany are available to date. AIM: To elucidate the nutritional composition of a GFD and to compare it with non-GFD in a representative German non-CD population. METHODS AND PATIENTS: A total of 1,000 patients who were members of the German Celiac Society (DZG) were invited to fill out a prospective 7-day food diary and a questionnaire. Data from 88 patients aged 14-80 years were analyzed and compared to the DACH reference values and to data from the German National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NVS II). RESULTS: No significant difference was observed for the intake of energy and macronutrients in male celiac patients compared to the NVS II. Only the fiber intake of male patients was significantly lower than that of the general population. Female patients, however, showed a significantly higher fat intake, but lower carbohydrate consumption. The average daily micronutrient intake of male and female patients, specifically of vitamin B1, B2, B6, folic acid, magnesium and iron, was significantly lower in celiac patients compared to the NVS II. CONCLUSION: This study reveals inadequate nutrient intake by male and female celiac patients in Germany. Based on our findings, regular (laboratory) monitoring of celiac patients should be recommended.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, an abundant and representative bacterium of Firmicutes phylum, has consistently been observed to be lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in healthy individuals. We have shown that both F. prausnitzii and its culture supernatant (SN) have anti-inflammatory and protective effects in a TNBS-induced acute colitis mouse model. Here, we tested the effects of both F. prausnitzii and its SN in moderate and severe DNBS-induced chronic colitis mouse models. METHODS: Colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of DNBS. After either 4 or 10 days of recovery (severe and moderate protocols, respectively), groups of mice were intragastrically administered either with F. prausnitzii A2-165 or with its culture SN for 7 or 10 days. Three days before being sacrificed, colitis was reactivated by administration of a lower dose of DNBS. The severity of colitis at the time of being sacrificed was assessed by weight loss and macroscopic and microscopic scores. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, cytokine levels, lymphocyte populations, and changes in microbiota were studied. RESULTS: Intragastric administration of either F. prausnitzii or its SN led to a significant decrease in colitis severity in both severe and moderate chronic colitis models. The lower severity of colitis was associated with down-regulation of MPO, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and T-cell levels. CONCLUSIONS: We show, for the first time, protective effects of both F. prausnitzii and its SN during both the period of recovery from chronic colitis and colitis reactivation. These results provide further evidence that F. prausnitzii is an anti-inflammatory bacterium with therapeutic potential for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The causes of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are largely unknown. This paper reviews the epidemiological and clinical data on how medications (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogens and antibiotics), lifestyle factors (smoking, psychological stress, diet and air pollution) may precipitate clinical relapses and recurrence. Potential biological mechanisms include: increasing thrombotic tendency, imbalances in prostaglandin synthesis, alterations in the composition of gut microbiota, and mucosal damage causing increased permeability. RESULTS: The clinical epidemiological data consistently reports positive associations between smoking and relapses in CD, and inverse ones with UC. For NSAIDs and estrogens, the epidemiological findings are inconsistent, although general antibiotic use was associated with a reduced risk of relapse in CD. High levels of stress were positively associated with relapse, although psychological interventions did not have therapeutic benefits. The limited work on diet has reported sulphur-containing foods are positively associated with relapse in UC, but there is no work in CD. Ecological data reported positive correlations between air pollution levels and IBD hospitalisations. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, to clarify this area, more clinical epidemiological work is required where detailed drug types and doses, and complete dietary intakes are measured, in specific forms of IBD. Such work could provide guidance to both patients and doctors to help maintain remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: The adhesion molecule expression and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proposed to be major factors for intestinal injury mediated by T cells in (IBD) and are up-regulated in intestinal mucosa of IBD patients. To investigate the effect of vitamin D derivatives on adhesion molecules and MMPs in colonic biopsies of IBD patients. METHODS: Biopsies from inflamed and non-inflamed tract of terminal ileum and colon and PBMC from the same IBD patients were cultured with or without vitamin D derivatives. MMP activity and adhesion molecule levels were determined. RESULTS: 1,25(OH)2D3 and ZK 191784 significantly decrease ICAM-1 protein levels in the biopsies obtained only from the inflamed region of intestine of UC patients, while MAdCAM-1 levels decrease in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 in the non-inflamed region, and, in the presence of ZK, in the inflamed one. In CD patients 1,25(OH)2D3 and ZK decrease ICAM-1 and MAdCAM-1 in the biopsies obtained from the non-inflamed and inflamed regions, with the exception of ICAM-1 in the inflamed region in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3. The expression of MMP-9, MMP-2, and MMP-3 decreases in the presence of vitamin D derivatives in UC and CD with the exception of 1,25(OH)2D3 that does not affect the levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in CD. Vitamin D derivatives always affect MMP-9, MMP-2 and ICAM-1 in PBMC of UC and CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the increased expression of ICAM-1, MAdCAM-1 and MMP-2,-9,-3 in IBD, our study suggests that vitamin D derivatives may be effective in the management of these diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Western diet is a risk factor for Crohn's disease (CD). Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6) is abnormally expressed in CD patients. This allows adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) to colonise the gut mucosa and leads to inflammation. We assessed the effects of a high fat/high sugar (HF/HS) Western diet on gut microbiota composition, barrier integrity and susceptibility to infection in transgenic CEABAC10 mice expressing human CEACAMs. DESIGN: Colonic microbiota composition and susceptibility of CEABAC10 mice to AIEC LF82 bacteria infection were determined in mice fed a conventional or HF/HS diet. Barrier function and inflammatory response were assessed by studying intestinal permeability, tight junction protein and mucin expression and localisation, and by determining histological score and levels of cytokine release. RESULTS: HF/HS diet led to dysbiosis in WT and transgenic CEABAC10 mice, with a particular increase in E coli population in HF/HS-fed CEABAC10 mice. These mice showed decreased mucus layer thickness, increased intestinal permeability, induction of Nod2 and Tlr5 gene transcription, and increased TNFalpha secretion. These modifications led to a higher ability of AIEC bacteria to colonise the gut mucosa and to induce inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Western diet induces changes in gut microbiota composition, alters host homeostasis and promotes AIEC gut colonisation in genetically susceptible mice. These results support the multifactorial aetiology of CD and highlight the importance of diet in CD pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Malnutrition is common in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), mainly in Crohn's disease (CD) because the small bowel is primarily affected. We reviewed the literature to highlight the importance of proper nutrition management. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed for English-language publications from 1999 through 2012. Manuscripts comparing nutritional approaches for IBD patients were selected. RESULTS: We identified 2025 manuscripts: six meta-analyses, 170 clinical-trials, 692 reviews. The study findings are discordant. In adult CD, enteral nutrition plays a supportive role, steroid therapy remaining the first choice treatment. In CD children enteral nutrition may represent the primary therapy. As regards parenteral nutrition, there are no large randomized studies, although mild improvements in morbidity have been described as a result of parenteral nutrition in malnourished surgical IBD patients. Specific micronutrient deficiencies are common in IBD. A number of factors may contribute to micronutrient deficiencies, and these include: dietary restriction, disease activity and surgery. The possible therapeutic roles of omega-3 fatty-acids, probiotics and prebiotics have been studied, but the results are still preliminary. CONCLUSION: Protein-energy malnutrition and micronutrient depletion are clinical concerns in IBD patients. Enteral nutrition, parenteral nutrition and micronutrient supplementation are cornerstone of the multidisciplinary management of IBD patients.},

   abstract = {ColoPulse tablets are an innovative development in the field of oral drug delivery and are characterized by a colon-specific release. Until now ColoPulse dosage forms (only capsules) have been studied in healthy volunteers having a standardized breakfast three hours after administration but not in specific patient groups and not with a shorter interval between administration and breakfast. Information on bioavailability and release characteristics of ColoPulse tablets in Crohn's patients and the influence of food and time of food intake is a prerequisite to properly design future clinical studies with active substances in these patients. In the current cross-over study bioavailability and drug release characteristics of ColoPulse tablets were compared in healthy volunteers and in Crohn's patients in remission. Furthermore the influence of food and time of food intake on the in vivo drug release behavior of ColoPulse tablets was investigated. In this study the dual label isotope strategy was used which means that a ColoPulse tablet containing (13)C-urea and an uncoated, immediate release tablet containing (15)N2-urea were taken simultaneously. Breath and urine samples were collected during the test day for isotope analysis. The appearance of the stable isotopes in breath and/or urine provides information on the site of release from the dosage form, release characteristics and bioavailability. Both tablets were administered on two different days in a cross-over design: the first day with a breakfast (non-standardized) one hour after administration and the second day with a standardized breakfast three hours after administration of the tablets. There was no difference in instructions for administration between both days. Results of 16 healthy volunteers and 14 Crohn's patients were evaluated. At least 86% (51 out of 59) of all ColoPulse tablets administered in this study released their contents at the desired intestinal region. There was no significant difference in bioavailability between healthy volunteers and Crohn's patients on both days (day 1 75.8% vs 90.2%, p=0.070 and day 2 83.4% vs 91.4%, p=0.265). There was also no significant influence of food and time of food intake on bioavailability in healthy volunteers (75.8% and 83.4%, p=0.077) and in Crohn's patients (90.2% and 91.4%, p=0.618) when day 1 and day 2 were compared. Release characteristics did not significantly differ between healthy volunteers and Crohn's patients. However, food and time of food intake had some, clinically non-relevant, influence on the release characteristics within both groups which is in line with the fact that food affects gastro-intestinal transit times. This study shows that ColoPulse tablets enable the site-specific delivery of drugs or other compounds (e.g. diagnostics) deep in the ileo-colonic region of the intestine of Crohn's patients in a comparable amount and rate as in healthy volunteers. Food and time of food intake had no relevant influence on bioavailability. In conclusion ColoPulse delivery systems are promising and deserve further research for local therapy with immunosuppressive drugs in Crohn's patients in the near future.},

   abstract = {Anorectal Crohn's disease is one of the most problematic and debilitating forms of Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that usually affects the intestines but may occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract and is frequently refractory to medication, which may ultimately result in proctocolectomy and ileostomy surgeries. It is reported in 3% to 5% of Crohn's patients and is found in conjunction with colorectal or enteric disease in one-third to one-half of Crohn's disease patients. This article discusses the use of metronidazole 10% ointment for the treatment of anorectal Crohn's disease. Since metronidazole is not U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for treating anorectal Crohn's disease, and there is no commercially available metronidazole 10% ointment, compounding pharmacists can play a role in providing this dosage form. This article discusses some of the common symptoms of Crohn's disease and the use of topical metronidazole to treat the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment resistant chronic pouchitis causes significant morbidity. Elemental diet is effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Since pouchitis shares some similarities to Crohn's disease we hypothesised that elemental diet may be an effective treatment. METHOD: Seven pouchitis patients (with ulcerative colitis) were studied. All had active pouchitis with a pouch disease activity index (PDAI) >/=7. Exclusion criteria were recent NSAIDs, antibiotics or probiotics. Sufficient elemental diet to achieve energy requirements was provided. Flexible-pouchoscopy was performed, and the Cleveland Global Quality of Life score (CGQoL), Pouch Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and BMI were recorded at baseline and following 28 days of elemental diet. Faecal samples were also collected at these time points and analysed for major bacterial groups using culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Data were analysed using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. RESULTS: Following 28 days of exclusive elemental diet, median stool frequency decreased from 12 to 6 per day (p=0.028), median clinical PDAI decreased from 4 to 1 (p=0.039). There was no significant difference in quality of life scores or PDAI before and following treatment. There was a trend towards an increase in the concentration of Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale (median 7.9 to 8.5 log(1)(0)/g, p=0.08) following exclusive elemental diet. CONCLUSION: Treatment with four weeks elemental diet appeared to improve the symptoms of chronic pouchitis in some patients but is not an effective strategy for inducing remission. Although a potential symptom modifier, elemental diet cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of active pouchitis.},

   abstract = {The mucosal barrier has three major components, the mucus layer, the epithelial glycocalyx and the surface epithelium itself, whose integrity largely depends on tight junction function. In health, there is relatively little direct interaction between the luminal microbiota and the epithelium - the continuous mucus layer in the colon keeps the surface epithelium out of contact with bacteria and the ileo-caecal valve ensures that the distal small intestine is relatively microbe free. Most interaction takes place at the Peyer's patches in the distal ileum and their smaller colonic equivalents, the lymphoid follicles. Peyer's patches are overlain by a 'dome' epithelium, 5% of whose cells are specialised M (microfold) epithelial cells, which act as the major portal of entry for bacteria. There are no goblet cells in the dome epithelium and M cells have a very sparse glycocalyx allowing easy microbial interaction. It is intriguing that the typical age range for the onset of Crohn's disease (CD) is similar to the age at which the number of Peyer's patches is greatest. Peyer's patches are commonly the sites of the initial lesions in CD and the 'anti-pancreatic' antibody associated with CD has been shown to have as its epitope the glycoprotein 2 that is the receptor for type-1 bacterial fimbrial protein (fimH) on M cells. There are many reasons to believe that the mucosal barrier is critically important in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These include (i) associations between both CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) with genes that are relevant to the mucosal barrier; (ii) increased intestinal permeability in unaffected relatives of CD patients; (iii) increased immune reactivity against bacterial antigens, and (iv) animal models in which altered mucosal barrier, e.g. denudation of the mucus layer associated with oral dextran sulphate in rodents, induces colitis. Whilst some IBD patients may have genetic factors leading to weakening of the mucosal barrier, it is likely that environmental factors may be even more important. Some may be subtle and indirect, e.g. the effects of stress on the mucosa barrier, whilst others may be more obvious, e.g. the effect of pathogen-related gastroenteritis, known often to act as trigger for IBD relapse. We have also been very interested in the potentially harmful effects of ingested detergents - either by contamination of cutlery by inadequate rinsing or via ingestion of processed foods containing permitted emulsifiers. In vitro and ex vivo studies show that even very small trace amounts of these surfactants can greatly increase bacterial translocation. Implications for therapy are not yet so obvious. We advise our IBD patients to avoid processed foods containing emulsifiers and to rinse their dishes well - whilst accepting that there is no direct evidence yet to support this. Therapies that aim to enhance the mucosal barrier have yet to come to market, but trials of enteric-delivered phosphatidylcholine in UC are promising. The faecal concentration of mucus-degrading bacterial enzymes (particularly proteases, sulphatases and sialidases) correlates with disease activity in UC, and these represent good targets for therapy.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), including Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, have long been associated with a genetic basis, and more recently host immune responses to microbial and environmental agents. Dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis allows one to study the pathogenesis of IBD associated environmental triggers such as stress and diet, the effects of potential therapies, and the mechanisms underlying intestinal inflammation and mucosal injury. In this paper, we investigated the effects of dietary n-3 and n-6 fatty acids on the colonic mucosal inflammatory response to DNBS-induced colitis in rats. All rats were fed identical diets with the exception of different types of fatty acids [safflower oil (SO), canola oil (CO), or fish oil (FO)] for three weeks prior to exposure to intrarectal DNBS. Control rats given intrarectal ethanol continued gaining weight over the 5 day study, whereas, DNBS-treated rats fed lipid diets all lost weight with FO and CO fed rats demonstrating significant weight loss by 48 hr and rats fed SO by 72 hr. Weight gain resumed after 72 hr post DNBS, and by 5 days post DNBS, the FO group had a higher body weight than SO or CO groups. Colonic sections collected 5 days post DNBS-treatment showed focal ulceration, crypt destruction, goblet cell depletion, and mucosal infiltration of both acute and chronic inflammatory cells that differed in severity among diet groups. The SO fed group showed the most severe damage followed by the CO, and FO fed groups that showed the mildest degree of tissue injury. Similarly, colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, a marker of neutrophil activity was significantly higher in SO followed by CO fed rats, with FO fed rats having significantly lower MPO activity. These results demonstrate the use of DNBS-induced colitis, as outlined in this protocol, to determine the impact of diet in the pathogenesis of IBD.},

Although the physiopathological mechanisms of the disease are not yet well defined, the unregulated immune response is associated with high production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These elements are associated with complex systems known as antioxidant defenses, whose function is ROS regulation, thereby preventing the harmful effects of these elements. However, the presence of an imbalance between ROS production and ROS elimination by antioxidants has been widely described and leads to oxidative stress. In this article, we describe the most significant findings on oxidative stress in the intestinal mucosa and peripheral blood.},

   abstract = {The physiology and pathology of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are closely related. This similarity between the two organs may underlie why dysfunction in one organ may induce illness in the other. For example, smoking is a major risk factor for COPD and IBD and increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease. Probiotics have been defined as "live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefits on the host." In model systems probiotics regulate innate and inflammatory immune responses. Commonly used probiotics include lactic acid bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Saccharomyces, and these are often used as dietary supplements to provide a health benefit in gastrointestinal diseases including infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer. In this respect, probiotics probably act as immunomodulatory agents and activators of host defence pathways which suggest that they could influence disease severity and incidence at sites distal to the gut. There is increasing evidence that orally delivered probiotics are able to regulate immune responses in the respiratory system. This review provides an overview of the possible role of probiotics and their mechanisms of action in the prevention and treatment of respiratory diseases.},

In mild to moderate ulcerative colitis probiotics can be used effectively in induction and maintaining remission, and prevention of pouchitis. As the other side of the shield, there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of probiotics in daily clinical practice in Crohn's disease. The aim of the present review is to provide help for clinicians about the probiotic use in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The comparison of literature data is limited by the large number of probiotic strains, various combined preparations, and different doses applied in the clinical studies. Small number of comparable protocols and lack of standardization encumber the analysis of study results.},

   abstract = {Paratuberculosis is an infectious, chronic, and incurable disease that affects ruminants, caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. This bacterium is shed primarily through feces of infected cows but can be also excreted in colostrum and milk and might survive pasteurization. Since an association of genomic sequences of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in patients with Crohn's disease has been described; it is of interest to rapidly detect M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in milk for human consumption. IS900 insertion is used as a target for PCR amplification to identify the presence of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in biological samples. Two target sequences were selected: IS1 (155 bp) and IS2 (94 bp). These fragments have a 100% identity among all M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis strains sequenced. M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was specifically concentrated from milk samples by immunomagnetic separation prior to performing PCR. The amplicons were characterized using DNA methylase Genotyping, i.e., the amplicons were methylated with 6-methyl-adenine and digested with restriction enzymes to confirm their identity. The methylated amplicons from 100 CFU of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis can be visualized in a Western blot format using an anti-6-methyl-adenine monoclonal antibody. The use of DNA methyltransferase genotyping coupled to a scintillation proximity assay allows for the detection of up to 10 CFU of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis per ml of milk. This test is rapid and sensitive and allows for automation and thus multiple samples can be tested at the same time.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a debilitating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can involve the entire digestive tract. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) encoding a missense variant in the autophagy gene ATG16L1 (rs2241880, Thr300Ala) is strongly associated with the incidence of Crohn's disease. Numerous studies have demonstrated the effect of ATG16L1 deletion or deficiency; however, the molecular consequences of the Thr300Ala (T300A) variant remains unknown. Here we show that amino acids 296-299 constitute a caspase cleavage motif in ATG16L1 and that the T300A variant (T316A in mice) significantly increases ATG16L1 sensitization to caspase-3-mediated processing. We observed that death-receptor activation or starvation-induced metabolic stress in human and murine macrophages increased degradation of the T300A or T316A variants of ATG16L1, respectively, resulting in diminished autophagy. Knock-in mice harbouring the T316A variant showed defective clearance of the ileal pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica and an elevated inflammatory cytokine response. In turn, deletion of the caspase-3-encoding gene, Casp3, or elimination of the caspase cleavage site by site-directed mutagenesis rescued starvation-induced autophagy and pathogen clearance, respectively. These findings demonstrate that caspase 3 activation in the presence of a common risk allele leads to accelerated degradation of ATG16L1, placing cellular stress, apoptotic stimuli and impaired autophagy in a unified pathway that predisposes to Crohn's disease.},

Trace elements are important parts of antioxidant protecting system, especially the selenium (Se), which, in the form of glutathione peroxidase contributes to the immunity of the gut (GALT). Due to the absorptional disorders and consequent malnutrition observed in the course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) an important role is associated with nutritional therapy, including energy-, protein- and trace element-support. Human studies show, that IBD is mostly accompanied by lower serum Se concentrations, reduced antoxidant and increased proinflammatory activity. Adequate Se-replacement may reduce the severity of organ failure and infections, but not mortality. However, it is encouraging that in animal studies obvious preventive effect of Se has been found on IBD and chronic inflammation induced colon cancer .},

   abstract = {Decreased consumption of dietary fibers, such as cellulose, has been proposed to promote the emergence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]) where intestinal microbes are recognized to play an etiologic role. However, it is not known if transient fiber consumption during critical developmental periods may prevent consecutive intestinal inflammation. The incidence of IBD peaks in young adulthood indicating that pediatric environmental exposures may be important in the etiology of this disease group. We studied the effects of transient dietary cellulose supplementation on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis susceptibility during the pediatric period in mice. Cellulose supplementation stimulated substantial shifts in the colonic mucosal microbiome. Several bacterial taxa decreased in relative abundance (e.g., Coriobacteriaceae [p = 0.001]), and other taxa increased in abundance (e.g., Peptostreptococcaceae [p = 0.008] and Clostridiaceae [p = 0.048]). Some of these shifts persisted for 10 days following the cessation of cellulose supplementation. The changes in the gut microbiome were associated with transient trophic and anticolitic effects 10 days following the cessation of a cellulose-enriched diet, but these changes diminished by 40 days following reversal to a low cellulose diet. These findings emphasize the transient protective effect of dietary cellulose in the mammalian large bowel and highlight the potential role of dietary fibers in amelioration of intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {At weaning, the intestinal mucosa surface glycans change from predominantly sialylated to fucosylated. Intestinal adaptation from milk to solid food is regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The contribution by glucocorticoid, an intrinsic factor, and colonization by microbiota, an extrinsic factor, was measured as the induction of alpha1,2/3-fucosyltransferase and sucrase-isomaltase (SI) activity and gene expression in conventionally raised, germ-free, and bacteria-depleted mice. In conventionally raised mice, cortisone acetate (CA) precociously accelerated SI gene expression up to 3 weeks and fut2 to 4 weeks of age. In germ-free mice, CA treatment induces only SI expression but not fucosyltransferase. In post-weaning bacteria-deficient (germ-free and bacteria-depleted) mice, fut2 expression remains at low suckling levels. In microbiota deficient mice, intestinal fut2 (but not fut1, fut4 or fut7) was induced only by adult microbiota, but not immature microbiota or CA. Fut2 induction could also be restored by colonization by Bacteroides fragilis, but not by a B. fragilis mutant unable to utilize fucose. Restoration of fut2 expression (by either microbiota or B. fragilis) in bacteria-depleted mice is necessary for recovery from dextran sulfate sodium-induced mucosal injury. Thus, glucocorticoids and microbes regulate distinct aspects of gut ontogeny: CA precociously accelerates SI expression and, only in colonized mice, fut2 early expression. The adult microbiota is required for the fut2 induction responsible for the highly fucosylated adult gut phenotype and is necessary for recovery from intestinal injury. Fut2-dependent recovery from inflammation may explain the high incidence of inflammatory disease (Crohn's and necrotizing enterocolitis) in populations with mutant FUT2 polymorphic alleles.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition that plagues millions all over the world. This debilitating bowel disease can start in early childhood and continue into late adulthood. Signs and symptoms are usually many and multiple tests are often required for the diagnosis and confirmation of this disease. However, little is still understood about the cause(s) of CD. As a result, several theories have been proposed over the years. One theory in particular is that Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is intimately linked to the etiology of CD. This fastidious bacterium also known to cause Johne's disease in cattle has infected the intestines of animals for years. It is believed that due to the thick, waxy cell wall of MAP it is able to survive the process of pasteurization as well as chemical processes seen in irrigation purification systems. Subsequently meat, dairy products and water serve as key vehicles in the transmission of MAP infection to humans (from farm to fork) who have a genetic predisposition, thus leading to the development of CD. The challenges faced in culturing this bacterium from CD are many. Examples include its extreme slow growth, lack of cell wall, low abundance, and its mycobactin dependency. In this review article, data from 60 studies showing the detection and isolation of MAP by PCR and culture techniques have been reviewed. Although this review may not be 100% comprehensive of all studies, clearly the majority of the studies overwhelmingly and definitively support the role of MAP in at least 30%-50% of CD patients. It is very possible that lack of detection of MAP from some CD patients may be due to the absence of MAP role in these patients. The latter statement is conditional on utilization of methodology appropriate for detection of human MAP strains. Ultimately, stratification of CD and inflammatory bowel disease patients for the presence or absence of MAP is necessary for appropriate and effective treatment which may lead to a cure.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is one of the therapeutic strategies used to induce remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Although its use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines and consensus documents, the frequency of this practice in Spain is unknown. METHODS: A 70-item questionnaire ( PRESENT: PREScription of Enteral Nutrition in pediaTric Crohn's disease in Spain) was drafted and distributed through the SEGHNP (Spanish Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) e-mail list. RESULTS: We received information from 51 Pediatric Gastroenterology Units. Of the 287 patients newly diagnosed with CD in 2011-2012 at these centres (139 in 2011, 148 in 2012), 182 (63%) received EEN (58% in 2011 and 68% in 2012). 26% of the patients who received EEN in the period studied (64/246) did so during relapses. All the physicians (100%) who responded to the questionnaire believe that EEN is effective in inducing clinical remission in mild to moderate CD. However, 24.5% of respondents never use EEN during relapses. The enteral formulas used most often used were polymeric formulas specific for CD (70.6%) and the preferred administration route was oral, with 60.8% using flavouring and 9.3% allowing a variable percentage of calories in the form of other foods. 65% use 5-ASA together with EEN, 69% use antibiotics and 95% immunomodulators (thiopurines). The duration of EEN tends to be 8 weeks (47.1%), and transition to regular diet was achieved sequentially over a variable period of time. Regarding barriers and limiting factors for the use of EEN, those most frequently reported include lack of acceptance by the patient and/or family (71%), lack of time and/or ancillary staff (69%) and difficulty in convincing the patient and/or family of the suitability of treatment (43%). CONCLUSIONS: EEN use rates are similar to those of other European questionnaires. Tools that facilitate acceptance by the patient and family are needed. Increasing the time dedicated to this therapeutic modality is likewise important. Given the disparity of criteria for indicating treatment with EEN, it would be useful to have widely accepted clinical practice guidelines or protocols that facilitate the decision to use it.},

Certolizumab pegol (Cp) is one of the anti-TNF-alpha agents introduced for the management of CD and rheumatoid arthritis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the efficacy of Cp in inducing clinical response and remission in CD and the associated adverse events. The effect of Cp in terms of CD patients' C-reactive protein (CRP) level was also studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Literature was searched for studies investigated the efficacy of Cp on inducing clinical response and maintaining remission in the patients with CD between 1966 and July 2012. RESULTS: Among 165 potentially relevant studies, six with a total of 1695 patients met the inclusion criteria and were meta-analyzed. In comparison to control groups, patients who received Cp had a relative risk (RR) of 1.38 with absolute risk reduction (ARR) = 0.12; 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.21), number needed for treatment (NNT) = 9; P < 0.0001 ) for clinical response and RR of 1.54 (ARR = 0.09; 95% CI = -0.0198 to 0.2), (NNT = 12; P < 0.0001) for maintenance of clinical remission and non-significant RR of 1.24 (P = 0.052) for induction of clinical remission. Baseline CRP did not significantly alter the magnitude or response. Adverse events were not significantly different among patients receiving Cp comparing to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Cp is effective for inducing clinical response and maintenance of clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe CD with similar side-effect profile as the control arms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of complementary alternative medicine (CAM) is potentially prevalent among paediatric patients with chronic diseases but with variable rates among different age groups, diseases and countries. There are no recent reports on CAM use among paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in Europe. We hypothesized that CAM use associates with a more severe disease in paediatric IBD and JIA. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire study among adolescent outpatients with IBD and JIA addressing the frequency and type of CAM use during the past year. The patients were recruited at the Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, Finland. RESULTS: Of the 147 respondents, 97 had IBD (Crohn's disease: n = 46; median age 15.5, disease duration 3.4 years) and 50 had JIA (median age 13.8, disease duration 6.9 years). During the past 12 months, 48% regularly used CAM while 81% reported occasional CAM use. Compared to patients with JIA, the use of CAM in IBD patients tended to be more frequent. The most commonly used CAM included probiotics, multivitamins, and mineral and trace element supplements. Self-imposed dietary restrictions were common, involving 27.6% of the non-CAM users but 64.8% of all CAM users. Disease activity was associated with CAM use in JIA but not in IBD. CONCLUSIONS: CAM use is frequent among adolescents with IBD and JIA and associates with self-imposed dietary restrictions. Reassuringly, adherence to disease modifying drugs is good in young CAM users. In JIA, patients with active disease used more frequently CAM than patients with inactive disease. As CAM use is frequent, physicians should familiarise themselves with the basic concepts of CAM. The potential pharmacological interaction or the toxicity of certain CAM products warrants awareness and hence physicians should actively ask their patients about CAM use.},

   abstract = {IBD is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gut that demands long-lasting treatment targeting both flare-up periods and maintenance of remission. Oral systemic steroids have been used to induce remission in patients with active IBD for over 50 years due to their potent anti-inflammatory effects. The efficacy of systemic steroids in this setting has been largely demonstrated. However, the wide range of adverse events associated with these drugs has prompted the development of equally effective but less toxic steroid compounds. Currently, topically acting oral steroids are an important therapeutic option for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and microscopic colitis, being oral budesonide and oral beclomethasone established elements of the IBD armamentarium. At present, oral budesonide is the first-line therapy to induce remission in microscopic colitis and mild to moderate ileocaecal CD patients and oral beclomethasone is effective treating mild to moderate UC patients with left-sided or extensive disease. This review aims at evaluating the current role of these compounds in IBD clinical practice.},

   abstract = {The knowledge about correlation patterns between the fecal microbiota and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)-comprising the two subforms Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)-for newly diagnosed untreated children is limited. To address this knowledge gap, a selection of faecal specimens (CD, n = 27 and UC, n = 16) and non-IBD controls (n = 30) children (age < 18 years) was analysed utilising bacterial small subunit (SSU) rRNA. We found, surprising age dependence for the fecal microbiota correlating to IBD. The most pronounced patterns were that E. coli was positively (R (2) = 0.16, P = 0.05) and Bacteroidetes, negatively (R (2) = 0.15, P = 0.05) correlated to age for CD patients. For UC, we found an apparent opposite age-related disease correlation for both Bacteroides and Escherichia. In addition, there was an overrepresentation of Haemophilus for the UC children. From our, results we propose a model where the aetiology of IBD is related to an on-going immunological development in children requiring different age-dependent bacterial stimuli. The impact of our findings could be a better age stratification for understanding and treating IBD in children.},

   abstract = {Although epidemiological findings support a role for vitamin K status in the improvement of bone indices in adult patients with Crohn's disease (CD), this needs to be confirmed in double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCT) with phylloquinone (vitamin K1). By conducting two RCT, the present study aimed to first establish whether supplementation with 1000 mug of phylloquinone daily near-maximally suppresses the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin in serum (%ucOC; marker of vitamin K status) in adult patients with CD currently in remission as it does in healthy adults and second determine the effect of supplementation with phylloquinone at this dose for 12 months on the indices of bone turnover and bone mass. The initial dose-ranging RCT was conducted in adult patients with CD (n 10 per group) using 0 (placebo), 1000 or 2000 mug of phylloquinone daily for 2 weeks. In the main RCT, the effect of placebo v. 1000 mug vitamin K/d (both co-administered with Ca (500 mg/d) and vitamin D3 (10 mug/d)) for 12 months (n 43 per group) on the biochemical indices of bone turnover (determined by enzyme immunoassay) and bone mass (determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were investigated. At baseline, the mean %ucOC was 47 %, and this was suppressed upon supplementation with 1000 mug of phylloquinone daily ( - 81 %; P< 0.01) and not suppressed further by 2000 mug of phylloquinone daily. Compared with the placebo, supplementation with 1000 mug of phylloquinone daily for 12 months had no significant effect (P>0.1) on bone turnover markers or on the bone mass of the lumbar spine or femur, but modestly increased (P< 0.05) the bone mass of the total radius. Despite near maximal suppression of serum %ucOC, supplementation with 1000 mug of phylloquinone daily (with Ca and vitamin D3) had no effect on the indices of bone health in adult CD patients with likely vitamin K insufficiency.},

Milk can be contaminated via direct excretion of MAP in milk or indirectly via fecal contamination of the milk. This study aimed at estimating the level of MAP in farm bulk tank milk and simulating the effect of direct and indirect contamination with MAP. The effect of discarding milk from test-positive cows at different prevalences was assessed. The concentration of MAP in milk was estimated using a simulation model, while taking direct and indirect contamination with MAP into account. Direct MAP contamination of milk was related to infection stages, while indirect contamination was associated with within-herd prevalence and distribution of cows in different stages of infection. Discarding of milk based on diagnostic test results was included as a control option. Median MAP load in farm bulk tank milk at within-herd infection prevalences from 7.5% to 60% were estimated to be 0.54-7.53 CFU/mL milk. Maximum concentration at the prevalence of 60% could be 1186 CFU/mL caused by shedding of high amounts of MAP in feces. At the prevalence of 15%, discarding milk from test positive cows would result in discarding 11% of milk and reduce the MAP level by 80%. Due to poor sensitivity of the diagnostic test, removing test-positive cows would not further reduce the already low concentration of MAP and it would not guarantee the milk as MAP-free. The model was relatively simple yet capable of capturing true infection status and associated contributions from milk and feces. Further knowledge on distribution of fecal excretion from infected cows is required because very few "super-shedders" might play a major role.},

   abstract = {Intestinal microbiota may influence human physiology and disease risk due to the role it plays in mediating appropriate immune responses to harmful and innocuous antigens. Colonisation of the intestine in early life seems particularly important as it is the main environmental stimulus for immune system maturation. This is a dynamic process, which depends on both environmental and genetic factors. The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease, involves genetic polymorphisms (e.g. CARD15/nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain 2) related to an excessive inflammatory response to commensal microbiota and to its unbalanced composition. Atopic diseases have also been linked to imbalances in microbiota and to related genetic factors (e.g. TLR4 and CD14 genes), although these associations are still controversial. Research into the relationship between the genetic risk of developing celiac disease (human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2/DQ8) and the early colonisation process in infants at family risk of the disease has also reported that the HLA-DQ genotype could influence staphylococcal colonisation. Future observational studies considering both host genetics and microbiota could be critical in defining the complex host-microbe interactions and the respective role each plays in inflammatory disorders.},

   abstract = {It has been presumed that aberrant immune response to intestinal microorganisms in genetically predisposed individuals may play a major role in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel disease, and there is a good deal of evidence supporting this hypothesis. Commensal enteric bacteria probably play a central role in pathogenesis, providing continuous antigenic stimulation that causes chronic intestinal injury. A strong biologic rationale supports the use of probiotics and prebiotics for inflammatory bowel disease therapy. Many probiotic strains exhibit anti-inflammatory properties through their effects on different immune cells, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion depression, and the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines. There is very strong evidence supporting the use of multispecies probiotic VSL#3 for the prevention or recurrence of postoperative pouchitis in patients. For treatment of active ulcerative colitis, as well as for maintenance therapy, the clinical evidence of efficacy is strongest for VSL#3 and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. Moreover, some prebiotics, such as germinated barley foodstuff, Psyllium or oligofructose-enriched inulin, might provide some benefit in patients with active ulcerative colitis or ulcerative colitis in remission. The results of clinical trials in the treatment of active Crohn's disease or the maintenance of its remission with probiotics and prebiotics are disappointing and do not support their use in this disease. The only exception is weak evidence of advantageous use of Saccharomyces boulardii concomitantly with medical therapy in maintenance treatment.},

   abstract = {There is increasing scientific interest in the field of vitamin D research, moving the focus beyond bone health to other disease processes. Low circulating vitamin D levels have been reported as a risk factor for several pathophysiologically divergent diseases, including cancers, diabetes, CVD, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But, therein, remains the challenge: can any single nutrient contribute to multiple complex disease mechanisms and, ultimately, have therapeutic potential? The aim of this review is to critically evaluate several strands of scientific evidence surrounding vitamin D and inflammation, primarily focusing on IBD. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased incidence of IBD and rheumatoid arthritis in countries of more northern latitudes, mirroring sunlight patterns. A considerable body of evidence supports the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, at least in animal models of IBD. Although it is accepted that suboptimal vitamin D status is common in IBD, some studies suggest that this associates with more severe disease. With regard to treatment, the data are only beginning to emerge from randomised controlled trials to suggest that people with IBD may remain in remission longer when treated with oral vitamin D. In conclusion, several strands of evidence suggest that vitamin D may modify the immune response in IBD. There is a continued need for large well-designed clinical trials and mechanistic studies to determine if, and how, this emerging promise translates into tangible clinical benefits for people with chronic debilitating diseases such as IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia seems to be a common phenomenon in both patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Many factors including deficiencies of cobalamin, folate and pyridoxine, smoking habits, alcohol and coffee intake, some medications and age may predispose subjects to hyperhomocysteinemia. The study aimed to evaluate homocysteine levels in an inflammatory bowel disease cohort as dependent of life style and disease activity. METHODS: 85 consecutive patients with inflammatory bowel disease (38 with Crohn's disease and 47 with ulcerative colitis) and 65 control subjects were included in the prospective study. The following parameters were analyzed: disease activity, duration of the disease, location of pathological changes, presence of complications, current medications, past surgical procedures, smoking history, concomitant diseases, biochemical parameters and plasma homocysteine levels. RESULTS: Mild hyperhomocysteinemia was found in 16 patients with Crohn's disease (42%), 19 patients with ulcerative colitis (40%) and 19 patients in the control group (29%) (p = 0.59). There was not any significant correlation between homocysteine level and disease activity. Only folic acid supplementation and gender affected homocysteine level. Folic acid intake led to reduction of homocysteine levels in all groups of patients (11.8 micromol/l vs. 8.33 miccromol/l, p = 0.0065 in Crohn's disease patients and 10.94 micromol/l vs. 7.78 micromol/l, p = 0.0069 in ulcerative colitis patients). CONCLUSION: Homocysteine level in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is mostly normal or slightly elevated. Disease activity does not have an impact on homocysteine level. Folic acid is the most important factor having an influence on homocysteine level in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

Therefore, the goal of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding bovine Dectin-1 (CLEC7A) and to assess their association with susceptibility to MAP infection in dairy cattle. Blood and milk samples, collected from commercial dairy operations, were tested for MAP infection using blood and milk ELISAs and a resource population consisting of 197 infected and 242 healthy cattle was constructed. Pooled DNA was used for sequencing and eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. Identified SNPs were genotyped on the resource population using the iPLEX MassARRAY system and statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression fitting the additive and dominance effects of each SNP in the model. Out of a total of eight identified SNPs, five were successfully genotyped, and three out of these five SNPs were found to be in complete linkage. Statistical analysis revealed a strong association between a non-synonymous SNP c.589A>G (p=0.008), and MAP infection status of the resource population inferred by seropositivity in MAP antibody specific ELISAs. This SNP c.589A>G was located in the geneic region that encodes the carbohydrate recognition domain of bovine Dectin-1. Therefore, further investigation of its functional relevance is warranted.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Vitamin D promotes bone health and regulates the immune system, both important actions for pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The supplementation dose that would maintain optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25OHD >/= 32 ng/mL) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to compare two supplementation regimens' efficacy and safety in maintaining optimal 25OHD in children with IBD. DESIGN: This was a randomized, not blinded, controlled trial. SETTING: The trial was conducted in the Boston Children's Hospital Clinical and Translational Study Unit. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-three patients, aged 8-18 years with IBD and baseline 25OHD greater than 20 ng/mL were enrolled; 48 completed the study, and one withdrew for adverse events. INTERVENTION: Arm A received 400 IU of oral vitamin D2 daily (n = 32). Arm B received 1000 IU daily in the summer/fall and 2000 IU in the winter/spring (n = 31). MAIN OUTCOME: The main outcome was the probability of maintaining 25OHD of 32 ng/mL or greater in all trimonthly visits for 12 months. RESULTS: Three participants in arm A (9.4%) and three in arm B (9.7%) achieved the primary outcome (P = .97). The incidence of adverse events, all minor, did not differ. More participants in arm A developed C-reactive protein level of 1 mg/dL or greater (31% vs 10%, P = .04) and IL-6 greater than 3 pg/mL (54% vs 27%, P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral vitamin D2 doses up to 2000 IU were inadequate to maintain optimal 25OHD but were well tolerated. The finding of lower incidence of elevated inflammatory markers and cytokines among participants receiving higher vitamin D2 doses merits further study.},

AIM: To compare the efficacy of the three anti-TNFs for CD in clinical practice. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients initiated on anti-TNF between 2004 and 2008. Disease activity, quality of life, and remission rates were compared between groups over 1 year. RESULTS: Sixty patients with CD were initiated on anti-TNF from 2004 to 2008: 31 on infliximab (IFX) and 29 on adalimumab (ADA) or certolizumab pegol (CTZ). More patients in the ADA/CTZ scores group had prior exposure to anti-TNF (76 versus 10%, p < 0.01). Mean Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) scores in the IFX group were lower than in the ADA/CTZ group at 12 months (2.72 +/- 3.34 versus 5.63 +/- 5.33, p = 0.03). At 12 months, more IFX patients were in remission compared with those on ADA/CTZ (88 versus 53%, p </= 0.01). Mean short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) scores were not different between the IFX and ADA/CTZ groups at 12 months. Stratified analyses and logistic regression based on prior anti-TNF use did not show differences in remission rates at any time point post-baseline between groups. CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for prior anti-TNF there was no difference in remission rates between the IFX and ADA/CTZ groups at any time point post-baseline. This suggests that differences between groups were accounted for by a higher rate of prior anti-TNF in the ADA/CTZ group. Our results should be reviewed with caution given the small sample size.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. The probiotic bacterium Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) has been used to maintain and induce clinical remission in UC. Our aim was to test the effect of Ciprofloxacin and/or orally administered EcN as add-on to conventional therapies in patients with active UC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our single center double-blinded randomized placebo controlled study included patients with a Colitis Activity Index (CAI) score of at least 6. Patients were randomized to Ciprofloxacin or placebo for 1week followed by EcN or placebo for 7weeks. All 4 treatments were given as add-on treatments. RESULTS: One hundred subjects with active UC were recruited. In the per-protocol analysis we, surprisingly, found that in the group receiving placebo/EcN fewer patients, 54%, reached remission compared to the group receiving placebo/placebo, 89%, p<0.05. Among patients treated with Cipro/placebo and Cipro/EcN, 78% and 66% reached remission, respectively. Furthermore, the group receiving placebo/EcN had the largest number of withdrawals, 11 of 25 (44%), compared to 15 of 75 (20%) in any of the other groups, p<0.05. Indication of lack of mucosal healing was found in the group treated with placebo/Nissle, since only 4 (29%) of the 14 patients, who completed the study, reported no blood in stools at week 12 (p<0.02), compared to 63%, 67% and 65% in groups treated with Cipro/Nissle, Cipro/placebo and placebo/placebo, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there is no benefit in the use of E. coli Nissle as an add-on treatment to conventional therapies for active ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, treatment with E. coli Nissle without a previous antibiotic cure resulted in fewer patients reaching clinical remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional implications of IBD.},

The aims of this study were to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory capacity of F. prausnitzii by comparing it with Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum) in both cellular and animal experiments. METHODS: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis rat models were treated with F. prausnitzii, B. longum, F. prausnitzii supernatant or F. prausnitzii medium, respectively. Interleukin (IL)-10, TGF-beta1 and IL-12p70 in human PBMCs culture supernatant and rat blood serum were detected. The frequency of CD25(+)Foxp3(+)Treg in human PBMCs, rat PBMCs and rat splenocytes were investigated. Besides, the T-bet, GATA-3, ROR-gammat and Foxp3 mRNA in human PBMCs, histopathologic characteristics of the intestinal mucosal and weight loss in the rat models were examined. RESULTS: F. prausnitzii, B. longum and F. prausnitzii supernatant clearly facilitated the induction of IL-10 and TGF-beta1, while induced relatively mild production of IL-12p70 in both cellular and animal models. The F. prausnitzii, B. longum and supernatant differed in their capacity to induce T-bet, GATA-3 and ROR-gammat mRNA expression in human PBMCs (both bacterial strains inhibited the expression of ROR-gammat while supernatant inhibited the T-bet and GATA-3). However, all of them induced the Foxp3 and Treg production and ameliorated the TNBS-induced colitis. In addition, F. prausnitzii supernatant exhibited the supreme anti-inflammatory capacity. CONCLUSIONS: F. prausnitzii and its unidentified metabolites in the supernatant are promising candidates in treating IBD, and further research remains necessary to elucidate the safety, efficacy, optimum and mechanism of this bacterium in the clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Vitamin D deficiency is common among patients with Crohn's disease. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the best measure of an individual's vitamin D status and current cut-off ranges for sufficiency are debatable. Several factors contribute to vitamin D deficiency in Crohn's disease. These include inadequate exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake, impaired conversion of vitamin D to its active metabolite, increased catabolism, increased excretion and genetic variants in vitamin D hydroxylation and transport. The effects of low 25(OH)D on outcomes other than bone health are understudied in Crohn's disease. The aim of the present review is to discuss the potential roles of vitamin D and the possible levels required to achieve them. Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D may have roles in innate and adaptive immunity, in the immune-pathogenesis of Crohn's disease, prevention of Crohn's disease-related hospitalisations and surgery, in reducing disease severity and in colon cancer prevention. The present literature appears to suggest that 25(OH)D concentrations of >/=75 nmol/l may be required for non-skeletal effects; however, further research on optimal levels is required.},

   abstract = {The essential micronutrient zinc has long been known to be a functional component of diverse structural proteins and enzymes. More recently, important roles for free or loosely bound intracellular zinc as a signaling factor have been reported. Insufficient zinc intake was shown to exacerbate symptoms in mouse models of inflammation such as experimental colitis, while zinc supplementation was found to improve intestinal barrier function. Herein, we provide evidence that intracellular zinc is essential for maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity when cells are exposed to the inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)alpha. Using the human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cell line as an in vitro model, we demonstrate that depletion of intracellular zinc affects TNFalpha-triggered signaling by shifting intestinal cell fate from survival to death. The mechanism underlying this effect was investigated. We show that TNFalpha promotes a zinc-dependent survival pathway that includes modulation of gene expression of transcription factors and signaling proteins. We have identified multiple regulatory steps regulated by zinc availability which include the induction of cellular Inhibitor of APoptosis (cIAP2) mRNA, possibly through activation of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-kappaB), as both nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and up-regulation of cIAP2 mRNA were impaired following zinc depletion. Moreover, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein level was profoundly reduced by zinc depletion. Our results provide a possible molecular explanation for the clinical observation that zinc supplements ameliorate Crohn's disease symptoms and decrease intestinal permeability in experimental colitis.},

   abstract = {One of the most significant challenges of cell biology is to understand how each type of cell copes with its specific workload without suffering damage. Among the most intriguing questions concerns intestinal epithelial cells in mammals; these cells act as a barrier between the internally protected region and the external environment that is exposed constantly to food and microbes. A major process involved in the processing of microbes is autophagy. In the intestine, through multiple, complex signaling pathways, autophagy including macroautophagy and xenophagy is pivotal in mounting appropriate intestinal immune responses and anti-microbial protection. Dysfunctional autophagy mechanism leads to chronic intestinal inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Studies involving a number of in vitro and in vivo mouse models in addition to human clinical studies have revealed a detailed role for autophagy in the generation of chronic intestinal inflammation. A number of genome-wide association studies identified roles for numerous autophagy genes in IBD, especially in Crohn's disease. In this review, we will explore in detail the latest research linking autophagy to intestinal homeostasis and how alterations in autophagy pathways lead to intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {Both ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic and potentially disabling interrelated conditions, which have been included under the group of spondyloarthropathies. The results of a large number of studies support the idea that an enteropathic pathogen, Klebsiella pneumoniae, is the most likely triggering factor involved in the initiation and development of these diseases. Increased starch consumptions by genetically susceptible individuals such as those possessing HLA-B27 allelotypes could trigger the disease in both AS and CD by enhancing the growth and perpetuation of the Klebsiella microbes in the bowel. Exposure to increased levels of these microbes will lead to the production of elevated levels of anti-Klebsiella antibodies as well as autoantibodies against cross-reactive self-antigens with resultant pathological lesions in the bowel and joints. Hence, a decrease of starch-containing products in the daily dietary intake could have a beneficial therapeutic effect on the disease especially when used in conjunction with the currently available medical therapies in the treatment of patients with AS and CD.},

The availability of rapid methods for assessing the viability of MAP cells in food, in particular milk, could be of great use for risk management in food safety. MAP viability is generally assessed using culture techniques that require prolonged incubation periods for the growth of MAP. To differentiate between viable and nonviable MAP cells in milk samples, this study explores the combination of two already described techniques: peptide magnetic bead separation followed by Propidium Monoazide qPCR. Using an Ordinal Multinomial Logistic Regression model to analyze the results obtained after spiking milk samples with mixtures containing different percentages of viable/dead cells, we were able to assess the probability of the viability status of MAP found in milk. This model was applied to contaminated pasteurized milk to ascertain the efficacy of heat treatment in MAP killing. The method reported herein can potentially be used for direct detection of MAP viability in milk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease (CD) and the epidemiological associations between diet and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) implicate diet in IBD causation. There is little evidence, however, to support specific dietary changes and patients often receive contradictory advice. AIM: To review the literature on the impacts of diet on IBD causation and activity to produce guidance based on 'best available evidence'. METHOD: Review of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases from 1975 to 2012 using MeSH headings 'crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'enteral' 'diet' 'nutrition' 'fatty acid' and 'food additives'. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with a formula-defined feed is effective treatment for CD, but approximately 50% of patients relapse within 6 months of return to normal diet. There is no direct evidence of benefit from any other specific dietary modification in CD, but indirect evidence supports recommendation of a low intake of animal fat, insoluble fibre and processed fatty foods containing emulsifiers. Foods tolerated in sustained remission may not be tolerated following relapse. Some evidence supports vitamin D supplementation. In ulcerative colitis (UC), evidence is weaker, but high intakes of meat and margarine correlate with increased UC incidence and high meat intake also correlates with increased likelihood of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence from interventional studies to support specific dietary recommendations. Nevertheless, people with IBD deserve advice based on 'best available evidence' rather than no advice at all, although dietary intake should not be inappropriately restrictive. Further interventional studies of dietary manipulation are urgently required.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) incidence has increased over the past fifty years but the explanation is unclear. CD can be brought into remission by liquid enteral feeding, but the mechanism for this response is unknown. We suggest that consumption of emulsifiers in processed foods may promote CD by increasing bacterial translocation. This is supported by evidence that (i) geographical variation in CD correlates with emulsifier consumption as does the increasing incidence of CD in Japan; (ii) although CD incidence also correlates with fat consumption, the response to enteral feeding is not affected by the fat content of the feed and (iii) very small concentrations of the emulsifier polysorbate 80 enhance bacterial translocation across intestinal epithelia. Undigested emulsifiers may increase bacterial translocation, particularly in the small intestine where the mucus layer is discontinuous. The hypothesis should be testable by trials of enteral feeding with/without emulsifiers.},

   abstract = {In this paper a review of the researches on the role of Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) in gastrointestinal diseases was presented. EcN is a non-pathogenic strain of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which has probiotic properties. In a number of studies conducted among humans and experimental animals the application of EcN in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases was observed. Most studies about EcN has been devoted to this organism efficacy in ulcerative colitis treatment. Comparable results were obtained, by citied authors, in the treatment (sustaining remission) of EcN and mesalazine in ulcerative colitis. Moreover, this probiotic therapy, compared to placebo, contributes to obtaining a faster remission and improvement of intestinal histopathology. The use of EcN in Crohn's disease has not been the subject of as many studies as in the case of ulcerative colitis. Assessing the importance of EcN in treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders, authors of the studies observed, that in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, who receiving this probiotic there was a pain, nausea and bloating reduction. In studies conducted among children a positive impact of EcN in prevention and treatment of diarrhea was demonstrated. Similar results were obtained in studies conducted in experimental animals. Based on the presented review it can be concluded that the strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is useful in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, especially in treatment of ulcerative colitis. This probiotic may constitute a part of treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. The effectiveness of this strain in treatment of Crohn's disease is not clearly established and further research are require.},

   abstract = {Metabolic traits are molecular phenotypes that can drive clinical phenotypes and may predict disease progression. Here, we report results from a metabolome- and genome-wide association study on (1)H-NMR urine metabolic profiles. The study was conducted within an untargeted approach, employing a novel method for compound identification. From our discovery cohort of 835 Caucasian individuals who participated in the CoLaus study, we identified 139 suggestively significant (P<5x10(-8)) and independent associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and metabolome features. Fifty-six of these associations replicated in the TasteSensomics cohort, comprising 601 individuals from Sao Paulo of vastly diverse ethnic background. They correspond to eleven gene-metabolite associations, six of which had been previously identified in the urine metabolome and three in the serum metabolome. Our key novel findings are the associations of two SNPs with NMR spectral signatures pointing to fucose (rs492602, P = 6.9x10(-44)) and lysine (rs8101881, P = 1.2x10(-33)), respectively. Fine-mapping of the first locus pinpointed the FUT2 gene, which encodes a fucosyltransferase enzyme and has previously been associated with Crohn's disease. This implicates fucose as a potential prognostic disease marker, for which there is already published evidence from a mouse model. The second SNP lies within the SLC7A9 gene, rare mutations of which have been linked to severe kidney damage. The replication of previous associations and our new discoveries demonstrate the potential of untargeted metabolomics GWAS to robustly identify molecular disease markers.},

   abstract = {The intestinal mucosa possesses a complex epithelial barrier and a well-organized local immune system, which both efficiently protect this internal-external surface against potential microbial aggressions while guaranteeing tolerance towards harmless bacteria or antigens (oral tolerance). There is good experimental evidence that the intestinal microbiota is a main driver for the development of the mucosal immune system. Any perturbations/changes of this interaction with the intestinal microbiota or the microbial colonization process may cause health problems with short- and eventually long-term consequences, such as suspected for allergic or dysimmune disorders. Dendritic cells (DC) play a key role in the initiation of immune responses. Immune responses elicited by intestinal DC differ markedly from those initiated by spleen-derived DC: while intestinal DC induce anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic responses to harmless antigens such as derived from the resident microflora or harmless food allergens, systemic immune activation yields in a strong inflammatory TH1/TH17 reaction to the same antigens. The recent discovery how DC functions are regulated and imprinted by the microenvironment (DC conditioning) will be discussed in this review. High concentrations of retinoic acid or vitamin D metabolites, thymic stromal lymphopoietin and/or transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) activate signaling programs in DC that yield in priming of regulatory and anti-inflammatory T cell responses. TGF-beta is one of the key factors implicated in intestinal immune regulation; it is produced by a large variety of cells in the intestinal mucosa, including intestinal epithelial cells, lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages/DC. An important anti-inflammatory effect of TGF-beta on the immune system is the promotion and generation of FOXP3-positive regulatory T cells in the intestinal compartment. There are first and encouraging data from the treatment of Crohn's disease, an inflammatory GI condition, that targeted enteral therapy with optimized concentrations of immunoregulatory peptides, such as TGF-beta, might of interest for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disorders (IBD) are characterized by chronic and recurrent inflammatory reactions of the intestinal mucosa resulting in progressing ulcerating lesions. Research over the past decade clearly identified in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) a marked dysregulation of the intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis) as one trigger factor in these inflammatory processes, particularly in patients with a high genetic risk. When treating patients with CD, most drugs aim to control the inflammatory process (either by inhibiting inflammatory pathways or by reducing the activity of immune cells). Given the importance of the disturbed interaction between the microbiota and the host immune system, there might be a different therapeutic approach in targeting directly the intestinal microflora. There are good data to believe that the use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is one such option. Historically, enteral nutrition (EN) was used as supplemental nutritional therapy in CD patients with planned resection surgery. This treatment option showed unexpected and very powerful anti-inflammatory effects, and it was rapidly introduced as induction therapy for active CD. Several clinical trials and case series confirmed the efficacy of EN to induce remission in approximately 80% of patients equaling the potential of steroids. It is well established that EN has this strong anti-inflammatory potential only when given on an exclusive basis, without any additional food. This raises major compliance issues, probably one of the reasons why it is less used in adult patients. A recent study demonstrated that EEN has a specific effect on the intestinal microbiota, which is markedly different from steroid-induced remission, while all patients obtained complete clinical remission. These observations give a first basis for the understanding of the impact of EEN on dysbiosis in patients with CD.},

Antibodies to cell wall mannan of this yeast (ASCA) have been traditionally used in the study of Crohn's disease (CD). We applied ASCA in relation to obesity. This study aims (i) to determine the concentration of ASCA (immunoglobulin A [IgA] and immunoglobulin G [IgG]) in obese compared with normal weight individuals and (ii) to determine if there is a correlation between ASCA concentrations, obesity indices and C-reactive protein. Forty obese individuals (body mass index [BMI] > 35 kg m(-2) ) and 18 healthy (BMI < 25 kg m(-2) ) volunteers participated in this case-control study. Binding activity of serum IgA and IgG to the cell wall mannan of S. cerevisiae was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. More than one-third of the obese individual (35%) showed elevated titres of ASCA compared with the control group (5%). This antibody was positively associated with weight (P = 0.01), BMI (P = 0.02) and waist circumference (P = 0.02), but not with C-reactive protein. It seems that ASCA are not only specific for CD but are also associated with obesity. S. cerevisiae or a related antigen may play a role in the matrix of this complex condition.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are intestinal disorders that comprise the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These disorders have a significant effect on the quality of life of affected patients and the increasing number of IBD cases worldwide is a growing concern. Because of the overall burden of IBD and its multifactorial etiology, efforts have been made to improve the medical management of these inflammatory conditions. The classical therapeutic strategies aim to control the exacerbated host immune response with aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biological agents. Although successful in the treatment of several CD or UC conditions, these drugs have limited effectiveness, and variable responses may culminate in unpredictable outcomes. The ideal therapy should reduce inflammation without inducing immunosuppression, and remains a challenge to health care personnel. Recently, a number of additional approaches to IBD therapy, such as new target molecules for biological agents and cellular therapy, have shown promising results. A deeper understanding of IBD pathogenesis and the availability of novel therapies are needed to improve therapeutic success. This review describes the overall key features of therapies currently employed in clinical practice as well as novel and future alternative IBD treatment methods.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are derived from traditional fermented foods, from beneficial commensals or from the environment. They act through diverse mechanisms affecting the composition or function of the commensal microbiota and by altering host epithelial and immunological responses. Certain probiotic interventions have shown promise in selected clinical conditions where aberrant microbiota have been reported, such as atopic dermatitis, necrotising enterocolitis, pouchitis and possibly irritable bowel syndrome. However, no studies have been conducted that can causally link clinical improvements to probiotic-induced microbiota changes. Whether a disease-prone microbiota pattern can be remodelled to a more robust, resilient and disease-free state by probiotic administration remains a key unanswered question. Progress in this area will be facilitated by: optimising strain, dose and product formulations, including protective commensal species; matching these formulations with selectively responsive subpopulations; and identifying ways to manipulate diet to modify bacterial profiles and metabolism.},

   abstract = {Abundant clinical and experimental evidence supports a role for resident microbiota in Crohn's disease and pouchitis, and probably in ulcerative colitis (UC). These disorders occur in areas of highest bacterial concentrations. Pouchitis and Crohn's colitis respond to antibiotics, while pouchitis and UC can be treated with probiotics. Serologic markers recognizing intestinal bacteria and yeast are present in the majority of Crohn's disease patients and may predict disease aggressiveness. Abnormal profiles of fecal and mucosally associated enteric bacteria (dysbiosis) occur in Crohn's disease, UC, pouchitis and experimental enterocolitis, with a proliferation of aggressive species that promote experimental colitis and a corresponding decrease in protective bacterial subsets. Many of these protective bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids, including butyrate, that promote epithelial barrier function, inhibit effector immune responses and induce regulatory T cell subsets. Furthermore, certain Clostridia species stimulate regulatory T cells that can inhibit intestinal inflammation. Animal models of chronic, immune-mediated enterocolitis convincingly demonstrate that enteric resident bacteria stimulate effector immune cells in susceptible hosts and that a subset of enteric bacteria has particularly aggressive activities, with host and bacterial specificity. Recent studies suggest parallel and perhaps complementary roles for enteric viruses, which have only very recently been identified.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract, whose major forms are represented by Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Their etiology is still unclear, although several factors have been identified as major determinants for induction or relapses. Among these, the role of the "forgotten organ", gut microbiota, has become more appreciated in recent years. The delicate symbiotic relationship between the gut microbiota and the host appears to be lost in IBD. In this perspective, several studies have been conducted to assess the role of prebiotics and probiotics in gut microbiota modulation. This is a minireview aimed to address in an easy format (simple questions-simple answers) some common issues about the theme. An update on the role of selected constituents of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD is presented together with the analysis of the efficacy of gut microbiota modulation by prebiotics and probiotics administration in the management of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To identify demographic and clinical characteristics associated with cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) in patients with Crohn's disease, and to assess strength of evidence for a causal relationship between medications and HSTCL in Crohn's disease. METHODS: We identified cases of HSTCL in Crohn's disease in studies included in a comparative effectiveness review of Crohn's disease medications, through a separate search of PubMed and Embase for published case reports, and from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS). We used three causality assessment tools to evaluate the relationship between medication exposure and HSTCL. RESULTS: We found 37 unique cases of HSTCL in patients with Crohn's disease. Six cases were unique to the published literature and nine were unique to AERS. Cases were typically young (<40 years of age) and male (86%). The most commonly reported medications were anti-metabolites (97%) and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFa) medications (76%). Dose and duration of therapy were not consistently reported. Use of aminosalicylates and corticosteroids were rarely reported, despite the high prevalence of these medications in routine treatment. Using the causality assessment tools, it could only be determined that anti-metabolite and anti-TNFa therapies were possible causes of HSTCL in Crohn's disease based on the data contained in the case reports. CONCLUSION: Systematic reviews that incorporate case reports of rare lethal events should search both published literature and AERS, but consideration should be given to the limitations of case reports. In this study, establishing a causative effect other than 'possible' between anti-metabolite or anti-TNFa therapies and HSTCL was not feasible because case reports lacked data required by the causality assessments, and because of the limited applicability of causality assessment tools for rare irreversible events. We recommend minimum reporting requirements for case reports to improve causality assessment and routine reporting of rare life-threatening events, including their absence, in clinical trials to help clinicians determine whether rare adverse events are causally related to a medication.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: SLC22A23 is an orphan gene in the SLC22 family of organic membrane transporters, and its single-nucleotide polymorphism rs17309827-T was recently nominally associated with intestinal inflammation in a genome-wide association study. Other polymorphisms in the SLC22A23 gene have been associated with diseases with an inflammatory component, and polymorphisms in related genes in the SLC22 family have been repeatedly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). OBJECTIVE: In a candidate-gene study using a well-phenotyped, highly monitored, Manitoban white cohort, we investigated whether variations in SLC22A23 were associated with intestinal inflammation. DESIGN: Selected genetic variations were genotyped by using fluorescent-based assays or a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 160 individuals with Crohn disease, 149 individuals with ulcerative colitis, and 142 healthy control subjects to determine genetic associations. RESULTS: Homozygocity for single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs4959235-TT and rs950318-GG was associated with IBD, whereby 6% of patients (18 of 311 cases) carried these genotypes, but they were not seen in healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Associations reported in this article add to the emerging evidence that SLC22A23 variants could modify IBD risk. However, the biology of the gene and impact of variations on the gene's functions need to be tested to validate a causative role.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether probiotics are beneficial at all stages of treatment in inflammatory bowel disease or superior to placebo remains controversial. METHODS: Two reviewers independently selected randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with controls in inflammatory bowel disease and extracted data related to remission/response rates, relapse rates, and adverse events. Subanalyses were also performed. RESULTS: Twenty-three randomized controlled trials with a total of 1763 participants met the inclusion criteria. From the meta-analysis, probiotics significantly increase the remission rates in patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) (P = 0.01, risk ratio [RR] = 1.51). The remission rates were significantly higher in patients with active UC treated with probiotics than placebo (P < 0.0001, RR = 1.80). Unfortunately, subgroup analysis found that only VSL#3 significantly increased the remission rates compared with controls in patients with active UC (P = 0.004, RR = 1.74). Interestingly, VSL#3 (P < 0.00001, RR = 0.18) also significantly reduced the clinical relapse rates for maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis. No significantly different adverse events were detected between probiotics and controls in the treatment of UC (P = 0.94, RR = 0.99) or CD (P = 0.33, RR = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of probiotics results in additional benefit in inducing remission of patients with UC. VSL#3 are beneficial for maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis. And, probiotics can provide the similar effect as 5-aminosalicylic acid on maintaining remission of UC, although no additional adverse events presented.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition is effective for inducing remission in active pediatric Crohn's disease. Partial enteral nutrition (PEN) with free diet is ineffective for inducing remission, suggesting that the mechanism depends on exclusion of free diet. We developed an alternative diet based on PEN with exclusion of dietary components hypothesized to affect the microbiome or intestinal permeability. METHODS: Children and young adults with active disease defined as a pediatric Crohn's disease activity index >7.5 or Harvey-Bradshaw index >/=4 received a 6-week structured Crohn's disease exclusion diet that allowed access to specific foods and restricted exposure to all other foods, and up to 50% of dietary calories from a polymeric formula. Remission, C-reactive protien, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were reevaluated at 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was remission at 6 weeks defined as Harvey-Bradshaw index </=3 for all patients and pediatric Crohn's disease activity index <7.5 in children. RESULTS: We treated 47 patients (mean age, 16.1 +/- 5.6 yr; 34 children). Response and remission were obtained in 37 (78.7%) and 33 (70.2%) patients, respectively. Mean pediatric Crohn's disease activity index decreased from 27.7 +/- 9.4 to 5.4 +/- 8 (P < 0.001), Harvey-Bradshaw index from 6.4 +/- 2.7 to 1.8 +/- 2.9 (P < 0.001). Remission was obtained in 70% of children and 69% of adults. Normalization of previously elevated CRP occurred in 21 of 30 (70%) patients in remission. Seven patients used the diet without PEN; 6 of 7 obtained remission. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary therapy involving PEN with an exclusion diet seems to lead to high remission rates in early mild-to-moderate luminal Crohn's disease in children and young adults.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are both typified by an altered intestinal microbiota, and gene associations imply various defects in the mucosal barrier and in the innate immune response to bacteria. This review aims to assess how alterations in diet or use of modified bacteria could have therapeutic effects in CD or UC. METHODS: A MEDLINE search using the terms 'prebiotic', 'genetically modified bacteria', 'mucosal barrier in association with ulcerative colitis', 'Crohn's disease' or 'microbiota'. RESULTS: A large body of data from in vitro and animal studies shows promise for therapeutic approaches that target the microbiota. Approaches include dietary supplementation with fermentable fibres (prebiotics) and soluble fibres that block bacterial-epithelial adherence (contrabiotics), enhancement of the mucosal barrier with phosphatidylcholine, and use of genetically modified bacteria that express IL-10 or protease inhibitors. Vitamin D supplementation also shows promise, acting via enhancement of innate immunity. Clinical trials have shown benefit with enterically delivered phosphatidylcholine supplementation in UC and near-significant benefit with vitamin D supplementation in CD. CONCLUSION: Strategies that target the microbiota or the host defence against it appear to be good prospects for therapy and deserve greater investment.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of two distinct clinical forms, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), with unknown aetiology, which nevertheless are considered to share almost identical pathophysiological backgrounds. Up to date, a full coherent mechanistic explanation for IBD is still lacking, but people start to realize that the pathogenesis of IBD involves four fundamental components: the environment, gut microbiota, the immune system and the genome. As a consequence, IBD development might be due to an altered immune response and a disrupted mechanism of host tolerance to the non-pathogenic resident microbiota, leading to an elevated inflammatory response. Considering the available data arising from the scientific literature, here reviewed, in CD, a benefit of probiotics remains unproven; in UC, a benefit of probiotics remains unproven, even if E. coli Nissle 1917 seems promising in maintaining remission and it could be considered an alternative in patients intolerant or resistant to 5-ASA preparations; in pouchitis, small controlled trials suggest a benefit from VSL no. 3 in the primary and secondary prevention of pouchitis; in IBD-associated conditions, a benefit of probiotics remains unproven. However, well-designed randomized control clinical trials are necessary to understand the undoubted role of these agents in the management of gut physiology in health and disease.},

   abstract = {Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS; recurrent aphthous ulcers; canker sores) belongs to the group of chronic, inflammatory, ulcerative diseases of the oral mucosa. Up to now, the etiopathogenesis of this condition remains unclear; it is, however, considered to be multifactorial. The results of currently performed studies indicate that genetically mediated disturbances of the innate and acquired immunity play an important role in the disease development. Factors that modify the immunologic response in RAS include: food allergies, vitamin and microelement deficiencies, hormonal and gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., celiac disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), some viral and bacterial infections, mechanical injuries and stress. In this paper, we presented the main etiopathogenetic factors of RAS with a special emphasis on the mechanisms of the immune response modification. Moreover, we discussed the crucial clinical symptoms and types of RAS together with epidemiologic data based on the current medical literature reports and our own observations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental enteropathy (EE) is subclinical, diffuse villous atrophy characterized by T cell infiltration of the small intestinal mucosa associated with nutrient malabsorption and stunting. EE is assessed by the lactulose:mannitol (L:M) test, whereby nonmetabolized sugars are ingested and quantified in the urine. Multiple micronutrient (MN) deficiency morphologically mimics EE, and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce mucosal inflammation in Crohn disease. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that supplementary MNs, with or without fish oil (FO), would improve L:M in rural Malawian children aged 1-3 y compared with a control (C) group receiving a placebo. METHODS: The MNs and FO provided the Recommended Dietary Intake for 26 vitamins, minerals, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. This was a 3-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with the primary outcomes being the change in L:M (DeltaL:M) after 12 and 24 wk of supplementation. Comparisons were made for DeltaL:M after 12 and 24 wk within each group by using a Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test, because the data are not normally distributed. RESULTS: A total of 230 children had specimens adequate for analysis; all had an abnormal baseline L:M, defined as >0.10. After 12 wk, children who received MNs + FO had a DeltaL:M [mean (95% CI)] of -0.10 (-0.04, -0.15; P = 0.001), and children receiving only MNs had DeltaL:M of -0.12 (-0.03, -0.21; P = 0.002). After 24 wk, children who received MNs + FO had a DeltaL:M of -0.09 (-0.03, -0.15; P = 0.001); children receiving only MNs had a DeltaL:M of -0.11 (-0.02, -0.20; P = 0.001), and the C group had DeltaL:M of -0.07 (0.02, -0.16); P = 0.002). Linear growth was similar in all groups, approximately 4.3 cm over 24 wk. CONCLUSION: Although the effect was modest, these data suggest MNs can transiently ameliorate EE in rural African children. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01593033.},

   abstract = {This review examines the use of digestive endoscopy to visualize intestinal helminths. The infections caused by these parasites are responsible for high levels of morbidity and mortality. These helminths can be visualized using gastroduodenal endoscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and colonoscopy. Endoscopic examination of the small bowel is limited by its considerable length and its distance from the mouth and anus. Since capsule endoscopy (CE) was first reported in 2000, it has been established as a noninvasive modality for the investigation of the gastrointestinal tract. CE is used as a first-line tool for imaging various small-bowel diseases, mainly obscure gastrointestinal bleeding and Crohn's disease. Since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved CE in 2001, the indications for its use have expanded widely. For example, CE can be used to visualize the in vivo kinetics of intestinal helminths. If the current trends in technological development continue, CE will become more widely used to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of helminth infections in the near future.},

   abstract = {The involvement of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD is supported by many findings and is thus now commonly acknowledged. The imbalance in the composition of the microbiota (dysbiosis) observed in IBD patients is one of the strongest arguments and provides the rationale for a therapeutic manipulation of the gut microbiota. The tools available to achieve this goal include fecal microbiota transplantation, but antibiotics and probiotics have been the most used one until now. Although antibiotics have shown some efficacy in inducing remission in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), as well as preventing postoperative relapse in CD, they are not currently recommended for the treatment of IBD except for septic complications, notably because of long-term tolerance and ecological issues. Some probiotics have been shown to be as good as 5-aminosalicylic acid to maintain remission in mild-to-moderate UC, but have been disappointing until now in CD in all tested indications. In pouchitis, antibiotics and probiotics have shown efficacy for inducing and maintaining remission, respectively. Targeting the gut microbiota in IBD is an attractive strategy. Current efforts to better understand the host-microbiota interactions in physiological as well as disease settings might lead to the development of rational-based treatments.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 38 (28 Male; 10 Female) hospitalized patients with moderate or severe IBD (13 with Crohn's disease (CD); 25 with Ulcerative colitis (UC)) were included. At stage 1, the disease severity, clinical symptoms and, signs, food consumption and nutritional status by using subjective global assessment (SGA) were recorded. At stage 2, the patients were blindly randomized into a Study Group and Controls. In the Study Group, a standard enteral product was added into the regulated hospital diets, but for the Controls, deficits were regulated by only hospital diets for 3 weeks. the independent variables were the group, the disease and its activity, age, Body body mass index (BMI), weight loss history, the hospitalization period; the dependent variables were SGA, bowel movements, change in nutritional status, disease severity, clinical findings, and also consumption of macronutrients. RESULTS: Prevalance of malnutrition (SGA-B or SGA-C) for all the patients was 92.1% at the beginning and 71.1% at the end of study. Improvements in disease activity score for the patients with UC were statistically significant in both the Study Group and the Controls (p=0.006 for the Study Group and p=0.001 for the Controls, respectively). Macronutrients, total and water soluble fiber consumption levels improved, with statistically significant differences for all the groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is a major problem in patients with IBD. Not only the regulation of hospital food, but also enteral nutritional support, improved their levels of malnutrition, as well as their energy, macronutrients, and fiber consumption, and SGA is an easy method for nutritional monitoring.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease with increasing incidence in children. Current medications have potentially serious side effects, hence increasing interest in alternative therapies. We previously developed an herbal formula, FAHF-2, based on a classical traditional Chinese herbal formula Wu Mei Wan that has long been used in China to treat colitis. We investigated FAHF-2's potential anti-inflammatory effects. METHODS: FAHF-2 efficacy was tested in vivo in the CD45RbRAG1 transfer colitis model. Weight loss, colonic histology, and cytokine production from mesenteric lymph nodes were assessed. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and colonic biopsies were obtained from children newly diagnosed with CD and controls and cultured with or without FAHF-2. Cytokine levels were measured by multiplex immunoassay. The effect of FAHF-2 on TNF-alpha-producing cells was determined by flow cytometry. NF-kappaB signaling was investigated in human lamina propria mononuclear cells upon FAHF-2 treatment by In-Cell Western. RESULTS: FAHF-2-treated mice had decreased weight loss, improved histology, and reduced TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-6, and IFN-gamma production. In vitro treated PBMCs produced less TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-12. FAHF-2 reduced the TNF-alpha-producing monocytes and T cells. Inflamed CD biopsies produced less TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-6, and IL-1beta. These effects are because of decreased NF-kappaB activation. CONCLUSIONS: FAHF-2 inhibited both adaptive and innate immune proinflammatory cytokine responses in PBMCs and inflamed CD mucosa due in part to blockage of NF-kappaB activation. FAHF-2 was effective in halting progression of colitis in a murine model. This study shows that FAHF-2 has potential as a novel treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {Loss-of-function variants within the gene locus encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) are associated with increased risk for Crohn's disease (CD). A disturbed regulation of T helper (Th) cell responses causing loss of tolerance against self- or commensal-derived antigens and an altered intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in CD pathogenesis. Loss of PTPN2 in the T-cell compartment causes enhanced induction of Th1 and Th17 cells, but impaired induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several mouse colitis models, namely acute and chronic dextran sodium sulfate colitis, and T-cell transfer colitis models. This results in increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis which is comparable with that observed in CD patients. We detected inflammatory infiltrates in liver, kidney, and skin and elevated autoantibody levels indicating systemic loss of tolerance in PTPN2-deficient animals. CD patients featuring a loss-of-function PTPN2 variant exhibit enhanced Th1 and Th17 cell, but reduced Treg markers when compared with PTPN2 wild-type patients in serum and intestinal tissue samples. Our data demonstrate that dysfunction of PTPN2 results in aberrant T-cell differentiation and intestinal dysbiosis similar to those observed in human CD. Our findings indicate a novel and crucial role for PTPN2 in chronic intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {Inadequate dietary intake of the essential trace element selenium (Se) is thought to be a risk factor for several chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. Biological actions of Se occur through low-molecular weight metabolites and through selenoproteins. Several key selenoproteins including glutathione peroxidases; selenoproteins M, P, and S; and selenium-binding protein 1 have been detected in the intestine. Interestingly, Se and antioxidant selenoproteins are known to modulate differentiation and function of immune cells and contribute to avoid excessive immune responses. This review discusses the role of Se and intestinal selenoproteins in inflammatory bowel diseases, based on data from human, animal, and in vitro studies. In humans, Se deficiency is commonly observed in patients with Crohn's disease. In animal models of experimental colitis, the Se status was negatively correlated with the severity of the disease. While the cause-effect relationship of these observations remains to be clarified, the beneficial outcome of dietary Se supplementation and an optimization of selenoprotein biosynthesis in murine inflammatory bowel disease models have led to investigations of targets and actions of Se in the gastrointestinal tract. The Se status affects gene expression, signaling pathways, and cellular functions in the small and large intestine as well as the gut microbiome composition. This data, particularly from animal experiments, hold promise that adequate dietary Se supply may counteract chronic intestinal inflammation in humans.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is supported by migration studies and increasing incidences in line with Westernisation. AIM: To give a complete overview of studies associating habitual diet with the onset or relapses in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: A structured search in Pubmed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE was performed using defined key words, including only full text papers in English language. RESULTS: Forty-one studies were identified, investigating onset (n = 35), relapses (n = 5) or both (n = 1). Several studies reported high intake of sugar or sugar-containing foods (n = 7 UC, n = 12 CD), and low intake of fruits and/or vegetables (n = 5 UC, n = 10 CD) to be associated with an increased onset risk. However, these findings could not be confirmed by similar or higher numbers of other studies. A possible protective role was found for grain-derived products in CD onset, but results were inconsistent for dietary fibre in UC and CD and grain-derived products in UC. No definite conclusions could be drawn for unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), protein and energy intake due to limited and/or inconsistent results. Six studies reported on diet and relapse risk, of which only two (n = 1 UC, n = 1 CD) had a prospective follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence is not sufficient to draw firm conclusions on the role of specific food components or nutrients in the aetiology of IBD. Furthermore, large prospective studies into the role of habitual diet as a trigger of relapses are needed, to identify new therapeutic or preventive targets.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is one of the most common diseases worldwide, resulting from a combination of environmental (gluten) and genetic (human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genes) factors. Depending on the geographical location, the prevalence of CD has been estimated to approximate 0.5-1%. The only treatment currently available for CD is a gluten-free diet (GFD) excluding gluten-containing cereals such as wheat, rye, and barley, and other foodstuffs with natural or added gluten. However, adherence rates and patient acceptance are often poor. Moreover, even in fully adherent patients, the diet may fail to induce clinical or histological improvement. Hence, it is unsurprising that studies show CD patients to be highly interested in non-dietary alternatives. The following review focuses on current pathophysiological concepts of CD, spotlighting those pathways which may serve as new possible, non-dietary therapeutic targets in the treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease, a chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, presents in two variations, Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Given that treatment of CD differs from UC, a single test that provided strong diagnostic ability would offer great clinical value. Two previous studies have indicated that CD can be distinguished from UC, and that both can be distinguished from non-IBD-type gastrointestinal disease, based on urinary and faecal metabolite profiling. METHODS: Analysis of healthy as well as CD and UC patients attending an IBD clinic was performed. IBD patients were classified into two groups (CD or UC) based on chart review of clinical, endoscopic, and histological assessment. Urine samples were obtained and analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with targeted profiling techniques, followed by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. RESULTS: Based on urinary metabolomics, individuals with IBD could be differentiated from healthy. Major differences between IBD and healthy included TCA cycle intermediates, amino acids, and gut microflora metabolites. Comparison of CD and UC patients revealed discrimination, but removal of patients with the surgical intervention confounder revealed that CD could not be discriminated from UC. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential for metabolomics to distinguish IBD from the healthy state but shows that careful consideration must be given to establishing disease-representative cohorts that are free of confounding factors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The single-nucleotide polymorphism T300A of ATG16L1, a Crohn's disease (CD)-associated gene, is responsible for decreased autophagy. This study aimed to investigate the effects of this single-nucleotide polymorphism on the uptake and processing of antigens by dendritic cells (DCs) and the interaction between DC and intestinal epithelium in pediatric patients with CD. METHODS: Pediatric patients who homozygously carry either the protective (wild type, n = 7) or risk allele (risk, n = 13) of ATG16L1, as well as heterozygous patients (het, n = 13) were enrolled. The monocyte-derived DC were analyzed for phenotype, antigen sampling, and processing by flow cytometry, whereas the capability of DC to form transepithelial protrusions was determined by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: DC generated from wild type patients showed higher bacteria sampling and antigen processing compared with risk patients. Additionally, after exposure to either bacteria particles or the antigen DQ-ovalbumin, wild type DC showed a significant increase in the expression of the HLA-DR and CD86 when compared with risk DC. Interestingly, also het patients showed an impairment in bacteria uptake and expression of activation marker when compared with the wild type. In the Caco2/DC coculture, the formation of transepithelial protrusions were less numerous in risk DC compared with wild type and the antigen uptake decreased. CONCLUSIONS: DC of pediatric patients with CD carrying the T300A allele showed a marked impairment of antigen uptake and processing and defective interactions between DC and intestinal epithelium. Collectively, our results suggest that an autophagy defect is associated with an impairment of intestinal innate immunity in pediatric CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation in the absence of a recognized etiology. The primary therapies are medications that possess anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects. Given the high use of complementary alternative medicines in pediatric IBD, a prospective tolerability study of curcumin, an herbal therapy with known anti-inflammatory effects, was conducted to assess possible dosage in children with IBD. METHODS: Prospectively, patients with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis in remission or with mild disease (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] <30 or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [PUCAI] score <34) were enrolled in a tolerability study. All patients received curcumin in addition to their standard therapy. Patients initially received 500 mg twice per day for 3 weeks. Using the forced-dose titration design, doses were increased up to 1 g twice per day at week 3 for a total of 3 weeks and then titrated again to 2 g twice per day at week 6 for 3 weeks. Validated measures of disease activity, using the PUCAI and PCDAI, and the Monitoring of Side Effect System score were obtained at weeks 3, 6, and 9. RESULTS: All patients tolerated curcumin well, with the only symptom that was consistently reported during all 3 visits being an increase in gassiness, which occurred in only 2 patients. Three patients saw improvement in PUCAI/PCDAI score. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that curcumin may be used as an adjunctive therapy for individuals seeking a combination of conventional medicine and alternative medicine.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Crohn disease is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation in the absence of a recognized etiology. Nutritional therapy in the form of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has an established role within pediatric Crohn disease. Following exclusive enteral nutrition's success, many dietary therapies focusing on the elimination of specific complex carbohydrates have been anecdotally reported to be successful. METHODS: Many of these therapies have not been evaluated scientifically; therefore, we reviewed the medical records of our patients with Crohn disease on the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD). RESULTS: Seven children with Crohn disease receiving the SCD and no immunosuppressive medications were retrospectively evaluated. Duration of the dietary therapy ranged from 5 to 30 months, with an average of 14.6+/-10.8 months. Although the exact time of symptom resolution could not be determined through chart review, all symptoms were notably resolved at a routine clinic visit 3 months after initiating the diet. Each patient's laboratory indices, including serum albumin, C-reactive protein, hematocrit, and stool calprotectin, either normalized or significantly, improved during follow-up clinic visits. CONCLUSIONS: This chart review suggests that the SCD and other low complex carbohydrate diets may be possible therapeutic options for pediatric Crohn disease. Further prospective studies are required to fully assess the safety and efficacy of the SCD, or any other low complex SCDs in pediatric patients with Crohn disease.},

Experiments were limited to double-blind placebo controlled trials. Five studies observing CD relapse rates and three studies examining biochemical changes were evaluated. The studies reviewed show contradicting information regarding the efficacy of omega-3 for CD. While some studies have shown supplementation with omega-3 results in sustained remission from disease, other studies concluded no correlation between omega-3 supplementation and improved remission rates. Studies investigating biochemical variables suggest favorable changes in immunological milieu, including modifications of lipid profiles and cytokine production. The studies reviewed are adversely limited by low number of participants, short duration of study and other significant deficits. Limited data remain available and current literature indicated mixed conclusions regarding the efficacy of omega-3 for treatment of CD. Further large-scale studies of longer duration are necessary.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in parallel genomic processing and computational mapping have been applied to the native human microbial environment to provide a new understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease. In particular, studies of the distal gut microbiome have proposed that changes in gut microbiota are related to obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and Western diet. We examined the changes in the distal gut microbiome composition as it relates to the lean and obese phenotypes, particularly after surgical weight loss. A PubMed search of publications from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2012, used the search terms weight, obesity, microbiome, and bariatric surgery. We included studies that provided information on subjects' weight and/or body mass index and a formal assessment of the microbiome. Certain bacteria, specifically the archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii, have enhanced ability to metabolize dietary substrate, thereby increasing host energy intake and weight gain. With weight loss, there is a decrease in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla. One major finding from microbial sequencing analyses after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the comparative overabundance of Proteobacteria in the distal gut microbiome, which is distinct from the changes seen in weight loss without Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This review provides the practicing surgeon with (1) an update on the state of a rapidly innovating branch of clinical bioinformatics, specifically, the microbiome; (2) a new understanding of the microbiome changes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and weight loss; and (3) a basis for understanding further clinical applications of studies of the distal gut microbiome, such as in Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, and infectious colitis.},

The detection of the cattle infection based on investigations of milk samples and evaluation of the capacity of the methods used to detect the disease was the objective of the present study. Following methods were applied for milk samples testing: detection of MAP in bacterial culture, detection of the specific IS-900 fragment of MAP in the genetic material isolated directly and detection of MAP antibodies. The results obtained were compared with the "golden standard" results, i.e. the isolation of MAP from the faeces. PQStat-the program for diagnostic reliability estimation, was used for evaluation of the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value. The method based on detection of the specific IS-900 fragment of MAP in the genetic material isolated directly from milk samples was found to possess the highest sensitivity. Detection of anti-MAP antibodies on the other hand showed the lowest sensitivity. The method of detecting anti-MAP antibodies in milk was the most specific while detection of the IS-900 fragment in the genetic material was the least specific method. These results obtained may serve as a guide to choose the most appropriate method for diagnosis of MAP infections by milk sample testing.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease, is a subject of increasing interest. Loss-of-function mutations in nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) are strong genetic factors linked to Crohn's disease, which eventually leads to an excessive mucosal inflammatory response directed against components of normal gut microbiota. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in inflammation processes, as well as in transduction of signals from receptors for several cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). ROS activate nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via IkappaB kinase (IKK) through the PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway. Therefore, this pathway is recognized to play a key role in Crohn's disease. Loss of function has been demonstrated to occur as an early event in a wide variety of diseases. Given this prevalent involvement in a number of diseases, the molecular development that modulates this pathway has been the subject of several studies. In addition, it has been the focus of extensive research and drug discovery activities. A better understanding of the molecular assemblies may reveal novel targets for the therapeutic development against Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Allergic colitis shows overlap with classic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Clinically, allergic colitis is associated with dysmotility and abdominal pain, and mucosal eosinophilia is characteristic. We thus aimed to characterise mucosal changes in children with allergic colitis compared with normal tissue and classic IBD, focusing on potential interaction between eosinophils and mast cells with enteric neurones. METHODS: A total of 15 children with allergic colitis, 10 with Crohn disease (CD), 10 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 10 histologically normal controls were studied. Mucosal biopsies were stained for CD3 T cells, Ki-67, eotaxin-1, and eotaxin-2. Eotaxin-2, IgE, and tryptase were localised compared with mucosal nerves, using neuronal markers neurofilament protein, neuron-specific enolase, and nerve growth factor receptor. RESULTS: Overall inflammation was greater in patients with CD and UC than in patients with allergic colitis. CD3 T-cell density was increased in patients with allergic colitis, similar to that in patients with CD but lower than in patients with UC, whereas eosinophil density was higher than in all other groups. Eotaxin-1 and -2 were localised to basolateral crypt epithelium in all specimens, with eotaxin-1+ lamina propria cells found in all of the colitis groups. Eotaxin-2+ intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) density was significantly higher in allergic colitis specimens than in all other groups. Mast cell degranulation was strikingly increased in patients with allergic colitis (12/15) compared with that in patients with UC (1/10) and CD (0/1). Tryptase and IgE colocalised on enteric neurons in patients with allergic colitis but rarely in patients with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Eotaxin-2+ IELs may contribute to the periepithelial eosinophil accumulation characteristic of allergic colitis. The colocalisation of IgE and tryptase with mucosal enteric nerves is likely to promote the dysmotility and visceral hyperalgesia classically seen in allergic gastrointestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {The etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases which include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease has not yet been clarified. Several hypotheses suggest a change in composition of gut microflora along with an impaired mucosal barrier that lead to excessive mucosal immunologic responses. Increased production of nitric oxide (NO) contributes greatly to the tissue injury caused by chronic inflammation. Evidence indicates that the mucus layer covering the epithelium is altered during UC and experimental colitis. Our aim in this study was to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of probiotic during DSS-induced colitis by modulating the immune system and colonic mucus production. For that purpose, the probiotic formulation Ultrabiotique((R)) (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifidobacterium breve) was administered daily for 7 d to mice with colitis. Probiotic supplementation improved clinical symptoms and histological alterations observed during DSS induced colitis. Ultrabiotique((R)) treatment down regulated the NO production by peritoneal macrophages of DSS-treated mice and enhanced mucus production in both DSS-treated and healthy mice. In conclusion, the modification of microflora by the Ultrabiotique((R)) played a beneficial role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier and promoted tissue repair.},

   abstract = {Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) represents a therapeutic modality that could save the life of a patient with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) facing severe nutritional problems, by restoring the patient's impaired nutritional status. TPN does not compete with enteral nutrition (EN), the latter being the first choice for all patients having anatomically intact and functionally normal digestive tract. TPN allows bowel rest while supplying adequate calorific intake and essential nutrients, and removes antigenic mucosal stimuli. The value of TPN in malnourished patients with intestinal failure due to CD is beyond doubt. However, it is difficult to suggest TPN as a sole treatment for active CD. An increased rate of remission could not be expected by applying TPN. The utility of TPN is restricted to certain cases involving efforts to close enterocutaneous or other complicated fistulas in patients with fistulizing CD, the treatment of short bowel syndrome following extensive resections for CD, or when EN is impractical for other reasons. There are no advantages of TPN therapy over EN therapy regarding fistula healing. TPN has no influence on the surgical intervention rate and little benefit by bypassing the intestinal passage could be expected. Also TPN shows no advantage if the disease is chronically active. However, an optimal supply of nutrients improves bowel motility, intestinal permeability and nutritional status, and reduces inflammatory reactions. TPN might be associated with an increased risk of adverse events, although TPN undertaken by experienced teams does not cause more complications than does EN.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In the era of modern multidisciplinary clinical management, very little is known about the prevalence and presentation of malnutrition in children with gastrointestinal disorders (GastroD) particularly employing composite, global measures of nutritional status. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Anthropometry, body composition, dietary intake, eating habits and grip strength were assessed with bedside methods in 168 patients from outpatient gastroenterology clinics (n, median (IQR) years; Crohn's disease (CD): n=53, 14.2 (11.6:15.4); ulcerative colitis (UC): n=27, 12.2 (10.7:14.2); coeliac disease: n=31, 9.3 (7.5:13.6); other GastroD: n=57, 9.8 (7.2:13.8)) and compared with 62 contemporary healthy controls (n, median (IQR): 9.8 (6.9:13.8)) and the results of the recent UK, National Diet and Nutritional Survey (NDNS). RESULTS: Children with CD had lower BMI z-scores than controls (median (IQR): -0.3 (-0.9:0.4) vs 0.3 (-0.6:1.4); P=0.02) but only 2% were classified as thin (BMI z-score <-2 s.d.). The prevalence of obesity in children with UC was 19%, 6% in CD, 11% in children with other GastroD and 15% in controls. No difference was found in grip strength measurement between groups. Except for CD children, the proportion of patients with suboptimal micronutrient intake was similar to that of controls and the cohort of children from the latest NDNS. A higher proportion of children with CD had suboptimal intake for riboflavin, vitamin B6 and calcium and consumed significantly more meat products, juices (including carbonated drinks), spreads/jams and crisps and savoury snacks and significantly fewer portions of dairy, fish, fruits and vegetables compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: GastroD affect children's body composition, growth, strength, dietary intake and eating habits, particularly CD, but to a lesser extent than expected.},

   abstract = {AIM: The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and evolution of anaemia in prospectively followed children and adolescents diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: The BELCRO registry (inclusion May 2008-April 2010), describing current clinical treatment practice of children diagnosed with CD, provided data on age, height, body mass index (BMI), paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI), therapy and haemoglobin (Hb) at diagnosis 12 and 24 months follow-up. Anaemia was defined as Hb < -2 sd, while severe anaemia was defined as Hb < -4 sd. Patients were classified as child </=13 and adolescent >13 years of age. RESULT: Ninety-six were included, 13 dropped out due to insufficient Hb data (37 females/46 males; median age 13.3 years, range 2.2-17.8 years). At diagnosis, the median Hb sd was -2.66 (-8.4; 1.07) and was correlated with the PCDAI (p = 0.013). At diagnosis, 51/83 (61%) were anaemic and all had active disease. Hb z-score significantly improved (p < 0.0001) but 26/68 (38%) remained anaemic at 12 months and 29/76 (38%) at 24 months of follow-up. The correlation to the PCDAI disappeared. At 24 months, children were more likely to be anaemic. There was no difference in iron dose nor duration of iron supplements between children and adolescents. Iron treatment was more readily given to patients presenting with anaemia. Hb did not differ between patients with (n = 28) or without iron supplements. Half of the patients with persisting anaemia were given iron supplements, of which, only three were given intravenously. CONCLUSION: Anaemia remains an important extra-intestinal manifestation of CD in children. Physicians, lacking optimal treatment strategies, undertreat their patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Osteoporosis and fractures are frequently encountered in patients with Crohn's disease. In order to prevent fractures, treatment with bone protecting drugs appears warranted early in the course of bone disease when bone loss is not yet prominent. We therefore aimed to demonstrate a beneficial effect on bone density of the bisphosphonate risedronate in osteopenic Crohn's disease patients. METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial of risedronate with calcium and vitamin D supplementation was performed in osteopenic Crohn's disease patients. Patients were treated for 2 years with follow-up after 3 and after every 6 months. Disease characteristics and activity and bone turnover markers were assessed at all visits; dual x-ray absorptiometry was performed at baseline, 12 and 24 months; radiographs of the spine at baseline and 24 months. RESULTS: Of 132 consenting patients, 131 were randomised (67 placebo and 64 risedronate). Patient characteristics were similar in both groups, although the risedronate group was slightly heavier (body mass index 24.3 vs 23.0 kg/m(2)). Bone mineral density at lumbar spine increased 0.04 g/cm(2) on average in the risedronate group versus 0.01 g/cm(2) in the placebo group (p=0.007). The mean increase in total hip bone mineral density was 0.03 versus 0.01 g/cm(2), respectively (p=0.071). Fracture prevalence and incidence were similar. Change of T-scores and concentrations of bone turnover markers were consistent with a beneficial effect of risedronate when compared with placebo. The effect of risedronate was primarily demonstrated in the first 12 months of treatment. No serious unexpected suspected adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A 24-month treatment course with risedronate 35 mg once weekly, concomitant with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, in osteopenic Crohn's disease patients improved bone density at lumbar spine.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to report on the measurement properties of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module for patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (FGIDs) and organic GI diseases, hereafter referred to as "GI disorders," for patient self-report ages between 5 and 18 and parent proxy-report for ages between 2 and 18 years. METHODS: The 74-item PedsQL GI Module and 23-item PedsQL Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 584 patients and 682 parents. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (such as chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease). RESULTS: Fourteen unidimensional scales were derived measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood, diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. The PedsQL GI Module Scales evidenced excellent feasibility, excellent reliability for the Total Scale Scores (patient self-report alpha = 0.97, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.97), and good-to-excellent reliability for the 14 individual scales (patient self-report alpha = 0.67-0.94, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.77-0.95). Intercorrelations with the Generic Core Scales supported construct validity. Individual Symptoms Scales known-groups validity across 7 GI disorders was generally supported. Factor analysis supported the unidimensionality of the individual scales. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL GI Module Scales demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent measurement properties and may be used as common metrics to compare GI-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice both within and across patient groups for FGIDs and organic GI diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to compare the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and worry of pediatric patients with functional GI disorders (FGIDs) and organic GI diseases to healthy controls utilizing the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales for patient self-reports ages 5-18 years and parent proxy-reports for ages 2-18 years. The secondary objective was to compare FGIDs and organic GI diseases to each other. METHODS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 587 pediatric patients with GI disorders and 685 parents of patients. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease). Ten Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring Stomach Pain, Stomach Discomfort When Eating, Food and Drink Limits, Trouble Swallowing, Heartburn and Reflux, Nausea and Vomiting, Gas and Bloating, Constipation, Blood, and Diarrhea were administered along with two Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. Five hundred and thirteen healthy children and 337 parents of healthy children completed the PedsQL Gastrointestinal Scales in an Internet panel survey. RESULTS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales distinguished between pediatric patients with FGIDs and organic GI diseases in comparison with healthy controls, supporting known-groups validity. Patients with FGIDs reported more GI symptoms and worry than patients with organic GI diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales may be utilized as common metrics across pediatric patient groups with FGIDs and organic GI diseases and healthy samples to measure GI-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice.},

   abstract = {Vitamins are micronutrient chemical compounds that cannot be synthesized by an organism but are essential for human metabolism and life. They act as required intermediaries, cofactors or coenzymes in many of the reactions of normal metabolism. In addition, anti-inflammatory effects have been reported for specific vitamins. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), vitamin deficiency is often due to malnutrition (due to a decreased food intake) or malabsorption (due to inflamed, malfunctioning mucosa and diarrhea) which results in anemia. Vitamin B(12) and folic acid supplementation may be necessary in IBD patients, especially those with Crohn's disease (CD) with either inflammation of the terminal ileum or after resection of the terminal ileum. It is also recommended during therapy with sulfasalazine as this compound inhibits the absorption of vitamin B(12). Patients with high or continuous inflammatory CD activity and frequent therapy with steroids have an increased risk of low bone mineral density and vitamin D deficiency. These should be monitored regularly and vitamin D should be supplemented. In a recent trial, a trend towards a reduced risk of relapses in CD patients treated with vitamin D was reported. Only limited studies and case reports exist on other vitamin deficiencies, e.g. vitamins A, B(1), B(2), niacin, B(6), C, E and K, found in IBD patients. These are summarized in this review. Regular nutritional monitoring in IBD patients is warranted and requires the special attention of treating physicians and dieticians.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2007, leading international experts in the field of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) recommended intravenous (IV) iron supplements over oral (PO) ones because of superior effectiveness and better tolerance. We aimed to determine the percentage of patients with IBD undergoing iron therapy and to assess the dynamics of iron prescription habits (IV versus PO). METHODS: We analyzed anonymized data on patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis extracted from the Helsana database. Helsana is a Swiss health insurance company providing coverage for 18% of the Swiss population (1.2 million individuals). RESULTS: In total, 629 patients with Crohn's disease (61% female) and 398 patients with ulcerative colitis (57% female) were identified; mean observation time was 31.8 months for Crohn's disease and 31.0 months for ulcerative colitis patients. Of all patients with IBD, 27.1% were prescribed iron (21.1% in males; 31.1% in females). Patients treated with steroids, immunomodulators, and/or anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs were more frequently treated with iron supplements when compared with those not treated with any medications (35.0% versus 20.9%, odds ratio, 1.94; P < 0.001). The frequency of IV iron prescriptions increased significantly from 2006 to 2009 for both genders (males: from 2.6% to 10.1%, odds ratio = 3.84, P < 0.001; females: from 5.3% to 12.1%, odds ratio = 2.26, P = 0.002), whereas the percentage of PO iron prescriptions did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-seven percent of patients with IBD were treated with iron supplements. Iron supplements administered IV were prescribed more frequently over time. These prescription habits are consistent with the implementation of guidelines on the management of iron deficiency in IBD.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major phenotypes of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) which constitute a spectrum of chronic, debilitating diseases characterised by a relapsing inflammation of the intestinal mucosal lining. Evidence from a variety of disciplines implicates the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of idiopathic IBD and their complications, including pouchitis. Many studies have reported a dysbiosis in IBD, characterised by a decrease in diversity, a decreased abundance of some dominant commensal members (such as Clostridium IV and XIVa) and an increase in detrimental bacteria (such as sulphate reducing bacteria and Escherichia coli). Therapies such as prebiotics and probiotics aim to selectively manipulate the intestinal microbiota and have been evaluated as an attractive therapeutic option with few side effects. The multispecies product VSL#3 was found effective in preventing and maintaining remission in pouchitis, whereas both VSL#3 and E. coli Nissle were effective in maintaining remission in UC. A more drastic approach to restore the composition of the microbiota and correct the underlying imbalance is a faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT has been successfully applied to treat patients with even recalcitrant Clostridium difficile infection. Particularly in UC, the majority of studies suggest that FMT may be an effective treatment option although the evidence is still limited. It is anticipated that our increasing knowledge on the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota components will allow in the future for a better selection of highly performing bacteria with specific functions required for specific benefits.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Osteopenia and increased risk for fractures in IBD result from several factors. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the dietary intake of calcium in IBD patients. METHODS: A 22-item quantitative validated frequency food questionnaire was used for quantifying dietary calcium in relation to gender and age, in 187 IBD patients, 420 normal- and 276 diseased controls. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Mann-Whitney, chi-square- and T-tests. RESULTS: The mean calcium intake was 991.0 +/- 536.0 (105.8% Recommended Daily Allowances) and 867.6 +/- 562.7 SD mg/day (93.8% RDA) in healthy and diseased controls, and 837.8 +/- 482.0 SD mg/day (92.7% RDA) in IBD, P<0.001. Calcium intake was high in celiac disease (1165.7 +/- 798.8 SD mg/day, 120% RDA), and non-significantly lower in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease (798.7 +/- 544.1 SD mg/day vs 881.9 +/- 433.0). CD and UC females, but not males, had a mean calcium intake well under RDA. In all study groups the intake was lower in patients believing that consumption of lactose-containing food induced symptoms, versus those who did not (105.8% vs 114.3% RDA in normal controls; 100.4% vs 87.6% RDA in IBD). CONCLUSIONS: Diet in IBD patients contained significantly less calcium than in healthy controls. Gender and age, more than diagnosis, are central in determining inadequate calcium intake, more so in IBD. Self-reported lactose intolerance, leading to dietary restrictions, is the single major determinant of low calcium intake. Inadequate calcium intake is present in one third of IBD patients and represents a reversible risk factor for osteoporosis, suggesting the need for tailored nutritional advice in IBD.},

There have been major initiatives in developed countries for the control of this incurable malady of animals and human beings alike (inflammatory bowel disease or Crohn's disease). Disease has not received similar attention due to inherent complexities of disease, diagnosis and control, in resource poor counties around the world. However, the rich genetic diverstiy of the otherwise low productive animal population offers opportunity for the control of Johne's disease and improve per animal productivity. Present review aims to gather and compile information available on genetics or resistance to Johne's disease and its future exploitation by resource poor countries rich in animal diversity. This review will also help to create awareness and share knowledge and experience on prevalence and opportunities for control of Johne's disease in the livestock population to boost per animal productivity among developing and poor countries of the world. Breeding of animals for disease resistance provides good, safe, effective and cheaper way of controlling Johne's disease in animals, with especial reference to domestic livestock of developing and poor countries. Study will help to establish better understanding of the correlation between host cell factors and resistance to MAP infection which may have ultimately help in the control of Johne's disease in future.},

However, primary and secondary failure are relatively frequent with all anti-TNF agents, which are available only as parenteral agents. Tofacitinib is an oral janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that inhibits JAK family kinase members, in particular JAK1 and JAK3, achieving a broad limitation of inflammation by interfering with several cytokine receptors. It first proved its efficacy as an immunosuppressive regimen after renal transplantation, and was recently approved by the FDA for rheumatoid arthritis. First data in IBD are promising, especially in ulcerative colitis. Ongoing clinical trials in both UC and Crohn's disease (CD) are needed to further explore its efficacy in CD and to better assess its safety profile.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enteral nutrition is used to treat a subset of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. Because dietary factors may contribute to an aggressive immune response toward the intestinal microbiota in the disease susceptible host, we used TNFDeltaARE/WT mice to study the therapeutic effect of a semisynthetic experimental diet in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD)-like inflammation in the ileum. METHODS: TNFDeltaARE/WT mice were fed chow and experimental diets partially fortified with gluten in a dose and time-dependent manner. Histopathology, markers of inflammation, intraepithelial lymphocytes phenotypes, and antigen-specific reactivation of CD4(+) T cells were determined. RESULTS: TNFDeltaARE/WT mice being transferred to an experimental diet with 7 but not with 10 or 14 weeks of age were protected from development of Crohn's disease-like ileitis. Although disease-related CD8alphabeta(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes were increased irrespective of dietary intervention, the protective effect of experimental diet was associated with decreased expression of inflammation markers in ileal tissues. In addition, CD4(+) T-cell reactivation in bacterial antigen-primed dendritic cell cocultures was not altered between semisynthetic and chow diet-fed TNFDeltaARE/WT mice, suggesting bacteria-independent mechanisms. Most importantly, gluten-fortified experimental diet induced chronic ileitis in TNFDeltaARE/WT mice, despite the fact that gluten-derived peptides failed to induce CD4(+) T-cell activation. Reduced occludin expression levels suggest a negative role of gluten-fortified experimental diet on intestinal barrier integrity. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease-like ileitis can be prevented at early stages of disease development using a semisynthetic experimental diet. Gluten was identified as antigen-independent dietary factor relevant for the induction of chronic inflammation in the small intestine of TNFDeltaARE/WT mice.},

   abstract = {The food dye FD&C Blue No. 1 (Brilliant Blue FCF [BB FCF]) is structurally similar to the purinergic receptor antagonist Brilliant Blue G (BBG), which is a well-known inhibitor of the ionotropic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R). The P2X7R functionally interacts with the membrane channel protein pannexin 1 (Panx1) in inflammasome signaling. Intriguingly, ligands to the P2X7R, regardless of whether they are acting as agonists or antagonists at the receptor, inhibit Panx1 channels. Thus, because both P2X7R and Panx1 are inhibited by BBG, the diagnostic value of the drug is limited. Here, we show that the food dye BB FCF is a selective inhibitor of Panx1 channels, with an IC50 of 0.27 microM. No significant effect was observed with concentrations as high as 100 microM of BB FCF on P2X7R. Differing by just one hydroxyl group from BB FCF, the food dye FD&C Green No. 3 exhibited similar selective inhibition of Panx1 channels. A reverse selectivity was observed for the P2X7R antagonist, oxidized ATP, which in contrast to other P2X7R antagonists had no significant inhibitory effect on Panx1 channels. Based on its selective action, BB FCF can be added to the repertoire of drugs to study the physiology of Panx1 channels. Furthermore, because Panx1 channels appear to be involved directly or indirectly through P2X7Rs in several disorders, BB FCF and derivatives of this "safe" food dye should be given serious consideration for pharmacological intervention of conditions such as acute Crohn's disease, stroke, and injuries to the central nervous system.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary fiber may favorably influence fermentation, gastrointestinal inflammation, and disease progression in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and pouchitis and offer an attractive therapeutic addition to pharmacological treatment. This systematic review appraised data from randomized controlled trials of fiber in the management of inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The review followed Cochrane and PRISMA recommendations. Seven electronic databases were searched along with hand searching and contacting experts. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of the effects of fiber on clinical endpoints (primarily disease activity for treatment or maintenance) or physiological outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: In total, 23 randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria (UC, 10; Crohn's disease, 12; and pouchitis, 1) recruiting 1296 patients. In UC, 3/10 studies reported fiber supplementation to benefit disease outcomes. In Crohn's disease, 0/12 studies and in pouchitis 1/1 study reported a benefit on disease activity. Despite this, a number of studies reported favorable intragroup effects on physiological outcomes including fecal butyrate, fecal calprotectin, inflammatory cytokines, microbiota, and gastrointestinal symptom indices. Meta-analysis was not possible. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited weak evidence for the efficacy of fiber in improving disease outcomes in UC and pouchitis. The potential antiinflammatory role of fiber is intriguing and merits further investigation in adequately powered clinical trials. Excluding overt gastrointestinal obstruction, there was no evidence that fiber intake should be restricted in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem with each human individual hosting at least 160 different bacterial strains. Our understanding of its role is rapidly expanding as a result of the molecular microbiological techniques that can accurately characterise its composition and 'omics' technologies that measure its metabolic activity. Since 1995, extensive research has investigated the prebiotic concept, which describes how supplementation of some non-digestible oligosaccharides can stimulate the growth and/or activity of specific genera including bifidobacteria. However, the vast majority of studies are in healthy human subjects, with few undertaken in patients with disorders relevant to clinical nutrition. Marked alterations of the luminal microbiota have been demonstrated in patients with digestive disorders, highlighting mechanisms through which they might be involved in their pathogenesis, including higher clostridia in patients who develop diarrhoea during enteral nutrition and the influence of bifidobacteria on intestinal dendritic cell phenotype in Crohn's disease. The impact of prebiotics on the intestinal microbiota of healthy people has not been consistently replicated in patients with digestive disorders. For example, a number of studies show that inulin/oligofructose do not increase bifidobacteria in enteral nutrition and Crohn's disease. Indeed, in Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome there is evidence that some prebiotics in high doses worsen functional symptoms. Unlike healthy human subjects, patients experience a number of issues that may alter their gastrointestinal microbiota (disease, antibiotics and inflammation) and the use of microbiota modifying therapies, such as prebiotics, do not always elicit the same effects in patients as they do in healthy people.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is direct evidence that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves the gastrointestinal microbiota and some evidence that the microbiota might also play a similar role in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of this article is to review the emerging evidence for the mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is strongly influenced by factors including age, diet and disease. Probiotics may be effective through their impact on the host gastrointestinal microbiota and promotion of mucosal immunoregulation. Probiotics are considered to be well tolerated, although the quality of studies and health claims has been variable. There are many short-term studies demonstrating the effectiveness of probiotics in IBS, although recommendations should be made for specific strains and for specific symptoms. Within IBD, a number of trials have shown the benefits of a range of probiotics in pouchitis and in ulcerative colitis, although current evidence in Crohn's disease is less promising. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics have considerable potential in the management of IBS and IBD; however, the benefits are strain specific. High-quality trials of probiotics in gastrointestinal disorders as well as laboratory investigations of their mechanism of action are required in order to understand who responds and why.},

   abstract = {The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is moving from the Crohn's Disease Activity Index to patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and objective measures of disease, such as findings from endoscopy. PROs will become an important aspect of assessing activity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and for labeling specific drugs for this disease. PROs always have been considered in the management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis, and have included measurements of quality of life, disability, or fatigue. Several disease-specific scales have been developed to assess these PROs and commonly are used in clinical trials. Outcomes reported by patients in clinical trials of IBD initially focused on quality of life, measured by the Short-Form 36 questionnaire or disease-specific scales such as the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire or its shorter version. Recently considered factors include fatigue, depression and anxiety, and work productivity, as measured by the Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, the Hospital Anxiety Depression, and the Work Productivity Activity Impairment Questionnaire, respectively. However, few data are available on how treatment affects these factors in patients with IBD. Although disability generally is recognized in patients with IBD, it is not measured. The international IBD disability index currently is being validated. None of the PROs currently used in IBD were developed according to FDA guidance for PRO development. PROs will be a major primary end point of future trials. FDA guidance is needed to develop additional PROs for IBD that can be incorporated into trials, to better compare patients' experience with different therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is administered subcutaneously to Crohn's Disease (CD) patients. There are very few studies evaluating the use of oral (PO) MTX in CD. A drug and its pharmaceutical alternative are equivalent (bioequivalence) when the bioavailability of the alternative falls within 80-125% of the bioavailability of the standard (US Food and Drug Administration - FDA). AIM: To compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of PO and subcutaneous (SC) MTX in CD patients to determine the bioequivalence of these two routes. METHODS: Eleven patients received a PO and an SC MTX dose (25 mg) separated by one week over a two-week interval. Blood samples were collected at specified times over a 24-h period for each patient on two separate days. MTX plasma levels were obtained using sensitive mass spectrometry. Areas under the curve (AUC) were compared between the two routes. RESULTS: The mean AUC values were 3375 ng/mL x h (PO MTX) and 3985 ng/mL x h (SC MTX). The mean AUC ratio (PO/SC) was 0.86 (0.62-1.08). This correlates with a relative PO bioavailability of 86% in comparison to SC. The 90% confidence interval for the mean AUC (PO/SC) ratio is (0.785, 0.929). There were no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The mean MTX AUC (PO/SC) in these patients falls outside the 90% confidence interval for the bioequivalence limit. SC MTX is more bioavailable than PO MTX; however, the mean relative MTX bioavailability (PO/SC) nearly met the FDA bioequivalence standard and PO MTX could be proposed in responders who would prefer this route.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess vitamin D status of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and to compare their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (s-25OHD) with established cutoffs and assess whether 6 months of supplementation with 2000 IU/d, vs 400 IU/d, would reduce the group prevalence of vitamin D below these cutoffs. STUDY DESIGN: Subjects 8-18 years (n = 83) with quiescent CD were randomized to either 400 or 2000 IU vitamin D3/d for 6 months. RESULTS: Baseline mean +/- SD s-25OHD was 24 +/- 8 ng/mL; 13 subjects (16%) had an s-25OHD <16 ng/mL, 27 (33%) < 20 ng/mL, and 65 (79%) < 30 ng/mL. There was no significant difference between groups in achieving the cutoffs of 16 ng/mL or 20 ng/mL at 6 months; however, only 35% of the 400 IU group achieved the greater cutoff of 30 ng/mL compared with 74% in the 2000 IU group (P < .001). Baseline adjusted mean s-25OHD concentrations at 6 months were 9.6 ng/mL (95% CI 6.0-13.2, P < .001) greater in the 2000 IU than the 400 IU group. Disease activity was not affected by supplement dose. Few subjects exceeded safety marker cutoffs, and this did not differ by dose. CONCLUSIONS: At baseline, a high proportion of patients had a mean s-25OHD >20 ng/mL. 2000 IU vitamin D3/d is more effective in raising s-25OHD concentrations to > 30 ng/mL in children with CD than 400 IU/d, but both treatments were equally effective at achieving 16 or 20 ng/mL.},

   abstract = {It is widely established that a high-protein fishmeal supplemented starter diet and Eimeria infection can predispose birds to the development of clinical necrotic enteritis symptoms following Clostridium perfringens infection. However, it has not been clearly established what changes these treatments cause to predispose birds to succumb to necrotic enteritis. We analysed caecal microbiota of 4 groups of broilers (n=12) using deep pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons: (1) control chicks fed a control diet, (2) Eimeria infected chicks fed control diet, (3) chicks fed fishmeal supplemented diet and lastly (4) both fishmeal fed and Eimeria infected chicks. We found that the high-protein fishmeal diet had a strong effect on the intestinal microbiota similar to the previously reported effect of C. perfringens infection. We noted major changes in the prevalence of various lactobacilli while the total culturable Lactobacillus counts remained stable. The Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, unknown Clostridiales and Lactobacillaceae families were most affected by fishmeal with increases in a number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that had previously been linked to Crohn's disease and reductions in OTUs known to be butyrate producers. Eimeria induced very different changes in microbiota; Ruminococcaceae groups were reduced in number and three unknown Clostridium species were increased in abundance. Additionally, Eimeria did not significantly influence changes in pH, formic, propionic or isobutyric acid while fishmeal induced dramatic changes in all these measures. Both fishmeal feeding and Eimeria infection induced significant changes in the gut microbiota; these changes may play an important role in predisposing birds to necrotic enteritis.},

   abstract = {The peptide transporter PEPT1, expressed in the brush border membrane of enterocytes, mediates the uptake of di- and tripeptides from luminal protein digestion in the small intestine. PEPT1 was proposed not to be expressed in normal colonic mucosa but may become detectable in inflammatory states such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. We reassessed colonic expression of PEPT1 by performing a systematic analysis of PEPT1 mRNA and protein levels in healthy colonic tissues in mice, rats, and humans. Immunofluorescence analysis of different mouse strains (C57BL/6N, 129/Sv, BALB/c) demonstrated the presence of PEPT1 in the distal part of the colon but not in proximal colon. Rat and human intestines display a similar distribution of PEPT1 as found in mice. However, localization in human sigmoid colon revealed immunoreactivity present at low levels in apical membranes but substantial staining in distinct intracellular compartments. Functional activity of PEPT1 in colonic tissues from mice was assessed in everted sac preparations using [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar and found to be 5.7-fold higher in distal compared with proximal colon. In intestinal tissues from Pept1-/- mice, no [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar transport was detectable but feces samples revealed significantly higher water content than in wild-type mice, suggesting that PEPT1 contributes to colonic water absorption. In conclusion, our studies unequivocally demonstrate the presence of PEPT1 protein in healthy distal colonic epithelium in mice, rats, and humans and proved that the protein is functional and contributes to electrolyte and water handling in mice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: PEPT1 was proposed to be expressed only in inflamed colonic tissues in which it could contribute to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development by transporting bacterial peptides, such as muramyl dipeptide (MDP), that activate intracellular pattern recognition receptors, such as the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain 2. To better define the pathological relevance of this transporter, we analyzed PEPT1 expression during intestinal inflammation and studied the susceptibility of Pept1-deficient (Pept1) mice to experimental colitis. METHODS: Wild-type and Pept1 mice were treated with dextran sulfate sodium and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid to induce colitis, and MDP-induced cytokine expression was studied in colonic tissue cultures. PEPT1 expression was characterized in mouse models of Crohn's disease-like ileitis (Tnf) or colitis (Il-10, Il-10XTlr2) and endoscopic tissue samples from descending colon of patients with IBD (n = 11) and controls (n = 17). Moreover, the prevalence of the PEPT1 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2297322 was tested in German patients with IBD (n = 458) and controls (n = 452). RESULTS: PEPT1 expression was consistently reduced under condition of acute or chronic experimental inflammation. Wild-type and Pept1 mice revealed comparable susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium-induced and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis, and MDP-induced cytokine expression was PEPT1-independent. PEPT1 expression levels were also decreased in descending colon of patients with IBD during acute inflammation, but the rs2297322 single-nucleotide polymorphism was not associated with IBD susceptibility in the German cohort. CONCLUSIONS: PEPT1 expression is reduced during intestinal inflammation and PEPT1 is neither required for MDP-induced immune response nor is the PEPT1 rs2297322 single-nucleotide polymorphism associated with IBD susceptibility in our German cohort. These data strongly argue against a primary role of PEPT1 in the initiation or progression of IBD.},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the aetiological agent of Johne's disease (JD), a chronic granulomatous enteritis that affects ruminants worldwide. While the ability of MAP to cause disease in animals is clear, the role of this bacterium in human inflammatory bowel diseases remains unresolved. Previous whole genome sequencing of MAP isolates derived from human and three animal hosts showed that human isolates were genetically similar and showed a close phylogenetic relationship to one bovine isolate. In contrast, other animal derived isolates were more genetically diverse. The present study aimed to investigate the frequency of this human strain across 52 wild-type MAP isolates, collected predominantly from Australia. A Luminex based SNP genotyping approach was utilised to genotype SNPs that had previously been shown to be specific to the human, bovine or ovine isolate types. Fourteen SNPs were initially evaluated across a reference panel of isolates with known genotypes. A subset of seven SNPs was chosen for analysis within the wild-type collection. Of the seven SNPs, three were found to be unique to paediatric human isolates. No wild-type isolates contain these SNP alleles. Interestingly, and in contrast to the paediatric isolates, three additional adult human isolates (derived from adult Crohn's disease patients) also did not contain these SNP alleles. Furthermore we identified two SNPs, which demonstrate extensive polymorphism within the animal-derived MAP isolates. One of which appears unique to ovine and a single camel isolate. From this study we suggest the existence of genetic heterogeneity between human derived MAP isolates, some of which are highly similar to those derived from bovine hosts, but others of which are more divergent.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effect of enteral nutrition (EN) as a maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) patients following surgery. METHODS: This study was an extension of our previous study to prolong the duration of intervention and follow-up from 1 to 5 years. Forty consecutive patients who underwent resection for ileal or ileocolic CD were included. Following surgery, 20 patients received continuous elemental diet infusion during the nighttime plus a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group). Another 20 patients received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (control group). All patients were followed for 5 years after operation. No patient received corticosteroid, immunosuppressants, or infliximab except patients who developed recurrence. The end point of this study was recurrence requiring biologic therapy or reoperation. Recurrence rates were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: In the EN group, four patients could not continue tube intubation for elemental diet intake. Two patients (10 %) in the EN group and nine patients (45 %) in the control group developed recurrence requiring infliximab therapy (P = 0.03). The cumulative recurrence incidence rate requiring infliximab was significantly lower in the EN group vs the control group (P = 0.02). One patient (5 %) in the EN group and five patients (25 %) in the control group required reoperation for recurrence (P = 0.18). The cumulative incidence of reoperation was lower in the EN group vs the control group, the difference not being significant (P = 0.08). CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this study suggest that EN therapy reduces the incidence of postoperative CD recurrence.},

Here we discuss the effects of n-3 PUFAs on various inflammatory pathways and how this leads to alterations in the function of inflammatory cells, most importantly endothelial cells and leukocytes. Strong evidence indicates n-3 PUFAs are beneficial as a dietary supplement in certain diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis; however for other conditions such as asthma, the data are less robust. A clearer understanding of the pharmacology of n-3 PUFAs will help to establish targets to modulate chronic inflammatory diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Fatigue, weakness and musculoskeletal manifestations are associated with IBD. An impaired nutritional status and a reduced physical activity can contribute to these clinical outcomes, impacting quality of life and increasing disability. This study aims to assess muscle strength and lower limb physical performance in female UC patients, taking into consideration disease activity, body composition and habitual physical activity. METHODS: A case-control study was performed including 23 UC female outpatients and 23 age- and BMI-matched healthy women as controls. Quadriceps strength (QS), handgrip strength (HGS), physical performance based measures (five repetitions sit-up test and 4meter gait speed test), body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis, anthropometry), and habitual physical activity (HPA) levels were assessed. RESULTS: UC group had decreased QS (-6%; P=0.012), slower sit-up test (-32%; P=0.000), slower gait speed (-17% P=0.002) and decreased HPA level (-30%, P=0.001) compared with controls. No difference in HGS was observed between groups. Logistic regression showed that UC was an independent factor for decreased QS and slower sit-up test, while HPA was a protective factor for impaired gait speed. Multivariate linear regression showed that BMI was independently associated with an improved QS and slower sit-up test in the UC group. CONCLUSION: Women with UC had decreased lower limb strength and mobility limitations, which were associated with BMI and the level of physical activity. Early evaluation of nutritional status and performance of the lower limbs could identify UC patients with pre-clinical disability who may benefit from earlier health lifestyle modifications.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence supports an immunologic role for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here we examined if pretreatment vitamin D status influences durability of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: All IBD patients who had plasma 25(OH)D level checked <3 months prior to initiating anti-TNF-alpha therapy were included in this retrospective single-center cohort study. Our main predictor variable was insufficient plasma 25(OH)D (<30 ng/mL). Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for potential confounders was used to identify the independent effect of pretreatment vitamin D on biologic treatment cessation. RESULTS: Our study included 101 IBD patients (74 CD; median disease duration 9 years). The median index 25(OH)D level was 27 ng/mL (interquartile range, 20-33 ng/mL). One-third of the patients had prior exposure to anti-TNF-alpha therapy. On multivariate analysis, patients with insufficient vitamin D demonstrated earlier cessation of anti-TNF-alpha therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-4.39; P = .04). This effect was significant in patients who stopped treatment for loss of response (HR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.34-9.09) and stronger for CD (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 0.95-5.99) than UC (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that vitamin D levels may influence durability of anti-TNF-alpha induction and maintenance therapy. Larger cohort studies and clinical trials of supplemental vitamin D use with disease activity as an end point may be warranted.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most commonly ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Patients affected with IBD experience symptoms including abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and weight loss. There is no cure for IBD; thus treatments typically focus on preventing complications, inducing and maintaining remission, and improving quality of life. During IBD, dysregulation of the intestinal immune system leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, and recruitment of activated immune cells to the intestine, causing tissue damage and perpetuating the inflammatory response. Recent biological therapies targeting specific inflammatory cytokines or pathways, in particular TNF-alpha, have shown promise, but not all patients respond to treatment, and some individuals become intolerant to treatment over time. Dietary peptides and amino acids (AAs) have been shown to modulate intestinal immune functions and influence inflammatory responses, and may be useful as alternative or ancillary treatments in IBD. This review focuses on dietary interventions for IBD treatment, in particular the role of dietary peptides and AAs in reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the gut, as well as recent advances in the cellular mechanisms responsible for their anti-inflammatory activity.},
