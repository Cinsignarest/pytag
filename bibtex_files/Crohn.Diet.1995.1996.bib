   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at risk for osteopenia. To study the metabolic bone status of these patients, a cross-sectional study was conducted. METHODS: Eighty-four patients (49 women, 35 men) with inflammatory bowel disease, 34 of whom had Crohn's disease and 50 ulcerative colitis (including 18 with prior coloproctectomy and ileoanal anastomosis), underwent clinical, dietary, and spine radiological assessments. Bone metabolism was assessed by measuring serum levels of calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (1-84), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and osteocalcin. Lumbar and femoral neck bone mineral densities were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Serum osteocalcin level was decreased in 29 patients (34%), 12 of whom had never undergone steroid therapy. The other biochemical markers of bone metabolism were in the normal range. Thirty-six patients (43%) had osteopenia, and 6 patients (7%) had vertebral crush fractures. Osteopenia was observed in 27 patients (52%) and 9 patients (28%) with and without corticosteroid therapy, respectively. No patient had clinical or biological signs of osteomalacia. Analysis of bone density (lumbar Z score) by a multiple regression analysis showed a statistically significant correlation with age, cumulative corticosteroid doses, sedimentation rate, and osteocalcin level (R2 = 0.76; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that bone turnover in inflammatory bowel disease is characterized by low bone formation in the presence of normal levels of calcium-regulating hormones.},

Over the months of the acute phase of the illness, a valuable insight was gained to the challenges of a physical disability and the difficulties of immobility, and the loss of independence. Also, the experience of being a patient rather than a nursing practitioner, gave first hand experience of the different situations patients meet on a daily basis throughout the health care services, both traditional and complementary, from a patient's perspective rather than from a nursing point of view. The following paper will hopefully help others to consider a fresh individual situations, reflect on the collaboration of traditional and complementary treatments, and treatment of underlying cause as well as symptoms.},

Host defense mechanisms that mediate enteric colonization include gastric acidity and intestinal motility. The small bowell overgrowth syndrome is a condition characterized by large numbers of bacteria, often anaerobes, in the upper intestine. Steatorrea, carbohydrate malabsorption and abdominal pain are frequently present. Predisposing conditions are localized anatomic disorders (surgical blind loops, small bowel strictures caused by surgery or Crohn's disease, short-gut syndrome without ileocaecal valve), motility derangements or reduction of gastric acidity. Diagnosis of the overgrowth syndrome is often difficult and quantitative cultures of jejunal-aspirated fluid is the best diagnostic test. Antimicrobial therapy directed against anaerobes is often successful, but the best therapeutic approach is the correction of predisposing conditions, if present.},

   abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: Fish oil, rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, can alter leukotriene production and hence neutrophil function, factors which may be important in the inflammation of Crohn's disease (CD). Therefore we studied the effect of dietary PUFA on neutrophil mediated ileal inflammation and neutrophil function in the rat. METHODS: Animals were ad libitum-fed pellet diets containing 9.5% fish oil (menhaden oil, rich in n-3 PUFA) with 0.5% safflower oil, 10% safflower oil (rich in n-6 PUFA) or standard chow (6% fat) for 50 days prior to the study. Weight and circulating leukocyte and total neutrophil counts were identical in all three groups. Neutrophil mediated ileal inflammation induced by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) perfusion was evaluated by measuring macromolecular uptake of radiolabelled dextran (MW 70,000) and changes in mucosal neutrophil infiltration. RESULTS: The fish oil diet group showed no difference in fMLP-induced permeability changes relative to the Chow Control group. However, the Safflower Oil supplemented diet group had a reduced permeability response (p < 0.01). Mirroring the permeability changes, there was diminished mucosal neutrophil infiltration in the Safflower Oil group following ileal perfusion with fMLP (< .005). Chemotaxis and chemiluminescence, two important neutrophil functions, were also significantly suppressed in the Safflower Oil animals (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The failure of a n-3 PUFA enriched diet to diminish the ileal inflammatory response to a bacterial peptide and suppress neutrophil function in the rat suggests such therapy would not be expected to be highly successful in CD. However, it requires confirmation in man, especially under the more complicated inflammatory conditions found in CD. On the other hand, the decreased neutrophil mediated responses with a high linoleic acid (n-6 PUFA) diet warrant further investigation.},

Incidence rates vary in different geographic areas, ranging from 2 to 4 new cases/100,000 inhabitants/year. Prevalence data range from 1.2 to 200,000/100,000. Ethnic differences are beginning to disappear, underlining the role of environmental factors in the genesis of the disease. At the moment the most reliable hypothesis is that CD has a multifactorial pathogenesis: antigenic and environmental factors acting in genetically predisposed patients. According to this hypothesis, first degree relatives of CD patients have a relative risk of disease ranging from 2 to 4. Many infective agents have been associated with its onset and relapse; the most reliable observations are those related to the measles virus. There is an activation of the immunosystem which is shown by abnormal T-cell activation, by the increase of some cytokines and by the expression of adhesion molecules. The role of oral contraceptives and diet as risk factors is controversial. Smoking is the only risk factor positively associated with the onset of CD and its clinical course; this association is specific and dose-related.},

Biochemical studies have revealed that Klebsiella bacteria, not only possess 2 molecules carrying sequences resembling HLA-B27 but increased quantities of such microbes are found in fecal samples obtained from AS patients and such patients have Crohn's like lesions in the ileo-caecal regions of the gut. Furthermore AS patients from 10 different countries have been found to have elevated levels of specific antibodies against Klebsiella bacteria. It has been suggested that these Klebsiella microbes, found in the bowel flora, might be the trigger factors in this disease and therefore reduction in the size of the bowel flora could be of benefit in the treatment of AS patients. Microbes from the bowel flora depend on dietary starch for their growth and therefore a reduction in starch intake might be beneficial in AS patients. A "low starch diet" involving a reduced intake of "bread, potatoes, cakes and pasta" has been devised and tested in healthy control subjects and AS patients. The "low starch diet" leads to a reduction of total serum IgA in both healthy controls as well as patients, and furthermore to a decrease in inflammation and symptoms in the AS patients. The role of a "low starch diet" in the management of AS requires further evaluation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to evaluate, using meta-analysis techniques, whether enteral nutrition is effective in inducing clinical remission in active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Randomized trials either comparing enteral nutrition with steroids or comparing elemental (amino acid-based) with nonelemental diets were selected using MEDLINE (1984 to 1994), reference lists from published articles, reviews, and abstracts from major gastrointestinal meetings. Sixteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria (four published as abstracts). Crude rates for induction of remission were collected on an intention-to-treat basis by three independent observers. Each study was given a quality score, based on predetermined criteria. RESULTS: The pooled odds ratio (OR) for all type of enteral diets compared with steroid therapy was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.53). This result was similar for the best studies (by quality score) combined, for trials using tube feeding combined, and when noncompliant patients were withdrawn. Further subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of the type of diet administered. Peptide-based diets were significantly inferior to steroids (pooled OR, 0.32; CI, 0.20 to 0.52). There was a trend to lower remission rate after elemental diets than after steroids (pooled OR, 0.44; CI 0.17 to 1.12). On the other hand, pooled OR for whole protein-based diets compared with elemental diets was 1.28 (CI, 0.40 to 4.02). CONCLUSIONS: Data available to date show that steroids are better than enteral nutrition to induce remission in active Crohn's disease. These results are more evident when peptide-based diets are administered, but they are not conclusive when either elemental or whole protein-based diets are used.},

The Dead Sea region of Israel is the lowest point on earth (402 m below sea level), and therefore the oxygen pressure is increased. We hypothesized that this elevation in oxygen pressure over an extended time might be as effective as shorter periods of high-pressure oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber. So we investigated whether the Dead Sea environment might affect the activity and perianal complications of Crohn's disease. Six patients with Crohn's disease unresponsive to medical treatment spent periods of 1-3 weeks at the Dead Sea. Four patients had discharging perianal fistulas. All were given advice concerning diet, physical activity, and immersion in the Dead Sea. The Clamp-Softley modification of the Harvey-Bradshaw Crohn's disease activity index was used to assess disease activity initially and at weekly intervals during treatment. Drug therapy was tailored to patient symptoms. Mean disease activity index before treatment was 9.0 +/- 1.4 (mean +/- SEM) and after a week at the Dead Sea 3.5 +/- 1.4 (p = 0.006). After 2 weeks the index decreased to 2.0 +/- 0.4 (p = 0.037) in four patients. In one patient, complete healing of perianal fistulae occurred after 2 weeks, and in two others there was striking improvement. Two patients with active Crohn's disease and on high-dose corticosteroids were able to stop all medication during their stay. Decrease in activity index occurred rapidly, whereas the improvement in perianal disease was more gradual. The Dead Sea environment was highly effective in managing patients with severe Crohn's disease, including perianal complications in this small, uncontrolled series.},

One hundred and thirty-nine patients with Crohn's disease were enrolled in this study. Remission was judged to be present when the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease score was < or = 1 and the CRP and ESR values were within the respective normal ranges. An amount of 30kcal per 1kg of ideal body weight (IBW) per day was administered enterally, and the effect on the induction of remission in relation to various patient background factors, such as disease type, history of bowel resection, and the presence/absence of complications, was determined. An excellent remission rate was achieved in those patients to whom an adequate amount of ED could be administered. Remission rates were lower in the patient groups with any of the following complications: stenotic bowel lesions, abdominal masses, fistulas, and anal lesions. Even in those groups in which stenotic lesions or abdominal masses were present, when adequate amounts of ED could be administered, the remission rate did not differ from that in the groups without these complications. The remission rates in the groups with and without fistulas at any site, including fistulas in the anal region, were 40.0% and 82.5%, respectively, with remission being considerably easier to achieve in the patients without fistulas. Similarly, remission was difficult to achieve when anal lesions were present. These results suggest that, for active Crohn's disease, nutritional therapy with ED ( > or = 35kcal/kg IBW) should be enthusiastically administered, and in patients in whom the presence of complications necessitates therapy for 3 months or more, this point be considered to indicate a possible surgical approach.},

   abstract = {The main aims of therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease) in children and adolescents are (1) the induction and maintenance of remission, (2) the correction of nutrient deficits and (3) the restoration of growth and maturation. These goals are reached with the use of a combination of therapeutic methods, including pharmacologic agents, nutritional and psychological support, and surgical intervention. The commonly used drugs sulfasalazine, corticosteroids and metronidazole have all been shown to be safe and efficacious when given to children. Newer steroid preparations that are rapidly degraded either in the target tissue or elsewhere are being studied. Of these, budesonide currently shows promise as an efficacious drug with few side effects, but its use in children needs further study. Newer 5-amino-salicylate preparations such as Asacol have been shown to be effective in children, but the number of patients studied is small. Immunomodulatory drugs such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine appear to be safe and efficacious for children; cyclosporine has been used infrequently to treat refractory Crohn disease in children. The use of other agents such as methotrexate, tacrolimus, monoclonal antibodies to cytokines, antibiotics and specific dietary products such as fish oils have not been intensively studied in children with Crohn disease. Nutritional therapy remains a mainstay of treatment because it corrects nutritional deficits, replaces losses and stimulates growth.},

The aim of the study was to compare by meta-analysis the likelihood of clinical response to liquid diet therapy vs. corticosteroids and to assess the importance of formula composition to efficacy. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials comparing exclusive enteral nutrition with corticosteroids and elemental with nonelemental formulas were identified through a combination of computerized and hand-searching techniques. Rates of clinical remission of active Crohn's disease, based on the intention-to-treat principle, were extracted from the studies by two independent reviewers. Odds ratios for likelihood of clinical response were calculated. RESULTS: In eight trials comprising 413 patients, enteral nutrition was inferior to corticosteroids (pooled odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.53). In five trials comprising 134 patients, there was no difference in the efficacy of elemental versus nonelemental formulas (pooled odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-1.83). CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids are more effective than enteral nutrition in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. Limited sample size precludes definitive conclusions about the importance of formula composition in the efficacy of enteral nutrition; however, data analyzed in this study do not support an advantage to elemental feedings compared with a polymeric formulation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To access concordance between radiological severity of aphthae and the more advanced features of Crohn's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 75 patients with an established diagnosis of Crohn's disease, we evaluated the radiological severity of colonic aphthae by meticulous double-contrast radiography. The degree of aphthae was defined as follows: AE0 = no lesions; AE1 = small nodules without barium flecks (lymphoid hyperplasia); AE2 = minute barium flecks < or = 1 mm in size with a translucent halo (umbilical or eroded lymphoid hyperplasia); AE3 = barium flecks varying from 2 mm to 5 mm in size (typical aphthoid ulcerations). We compared the degree of the lesions to the disease activity, and reviewed these sequential changes during a mean interval of 10 months. RESULTS: AE3 lesions were more prevalent than AE1 or AE2 lesions in patients with active colitis. AE1 or AE2 lesions were found regardless of the involved bowel sites or the disease activity. Of 44 patients receiving a nutritional diet, 26 patients showed regression of the lesions although most of the patients still exhibited AE1 or AE2 lesions. In two of eight patients without the treatment, the lesions progressed. CONCLUSION: In Crohn's disease, development of aphthoid ulcers is associated with disease activity; lymphoid hyperplasia may exist independently of disease activity.},

Malnutrition is a common occurrence in IBD, and this must be considered in the treatment of these diseases. Nutritional support in IBD has limited use as primary therapy (Table 2). Even though parenteral and enteral nutrition have been associated with remission, relapse frequently occurs when normal food intake is resumed. Likewise, fistulae may resolve with aggressive, nutritional therapy, but they frequently recur with reinstitution of food. In short bowel syndrome caused by extensive intestinal resection performed in CD, parenteral nutrition provides an important mode of therapy. In addition, perioperative use of nutritional support may decrease the incidence of postoperative complications in patients who are malnourished. Nutritional support in pediatric patients with CD who have growth failure has been effective in stimulating growth.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effect of nasogastric feeding with high- and low-fat, peptide-based diets on body composition and disease activity was studied in adolescents with active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Fourteen patients with active Crohn's disease (12 to 17 years) were fed exclusively through nasogastric feedings with two isocaloric, isonitrogenous, peptide-based diets, either with low- or high-fat content, for 3 weeks each in a randomized manner then were "crossed over" to the other diet for another 3 weeks of feeding. At the end of each 3-week period, urine and stools were collected for 72 hours for measuring energy absorption and nitrogen utilization (n = 6). Weight, height, triceps skin folds, fat free body mass, and disease activity were also monitored (n = 14). RESULTS: There was no difference in any parameter of energy absorption or nitrogen utilization between the two formulas irrespective of the order in which they were administered. The changes in nutritional parameters were also comparable with both formulas. There was a significant increase in weight, fat free body mass and triceps skinfold thickness during both the 3-week periods of feeding (p < .05). This was accompanied by a significant reduction in the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Peptide-based diets may be useful in restoring the fat free body mass and improving the disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease. A high fat (high medium-chain triglycerides) diet did not offer any nutritional advantage over a similar but low-fat diet. The improvement in disease activity during feeding with a low-fat diet was comparable to that with a high-fat diet. The improvement in disease activity seems to be associated with improvement in lean body mass irrespective of the type of diet used to achieve it.},

Although pharmacologic approaches to maintaining Crohn's disease in remission have significantly improved, most of the currently available modalities are associated with significant morbidity. Recently, an enteric-coated preparation of fish oil has been shown to be effective in reducing the rate of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease in remission who are at high risk of relapse. Because of minimal side effects, fish oil appears to be an ideal maintenance agent in Crohn's disease. However, until results from studies that compare the therapeutic effect of fish oil to the currently available maintenance agents are available, fish oil supplementation cannot be recommended as a sole maintenance agent at present. It does, however, seem prudent to promote a diet rich in fish oil in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Short-bowel syndrome is a state of severe malabsorption secondary to extensive bowel resection. The most common reasons for extensive bowel resection are Crohn's disease and mesenteric infarction. The pathophysiological consequences depend on extent and site of resection, integrity and adaptation of the remaining bowel, and secondary effects on other organs. Most extensively bowel resected patients can be adequately nourished by mouth, especially since they develop compensatory hyperphagia. For patients with colon in function a high-carbohydrate low-fat diet is beneficial compared to a diet with a normal fat content, because it results in decreased diarrhoea, decreased faecal mineral losses, and increased energy assimilation. The relative amount of dietary fat does not influence stool mass or energy assimilation in jejunostomy patients. Patients with jejunostomy have a high faecal output of water, sodium, and divalent cations, and they often need permanent parenteral supply of saline as well as calcium and magnesium if their small intestinal remnant is < 200 cm and parenteral nutritional support if they retain < 100 cm small bowel. In contrast, 50 cm of the jejunum often suffices for adequate oral nutrition if most of the colon is preserved. The majority of patients needing long-term intravenous supply are trained to administer parenteral nutrition at home (HPN). Most patients on HPN obtain a good or fair quality of life with hospital readmissions corresponding to an average of 10% of the HPN duration and an overall HPN related mortality of about 4%.},

   abstract = {If one reviews the literature with zeal, it is increasingly apparent that few organs escape recruitment when IBD is chronic or progressive. Insights into mucosal pathophysiology have helped with understanding the more frequent extraintestinal manifestations, but the mechanisms attendant to the development of less common events (e.g. acute pancreatitis, concurrent gluten sensitive enteropathy, or active pulmonary disease) remain either poorly studied or obscure. It is particularly interesting, however, to read reports of abnormal pulmonary function, generally of the obstructive type, correlated to measurements of abnormal intestinal permeability in patients with either active pulmonary sarcoid or pulmonary involvement in Crohn's disease. It has been further speculated that similarities in the mucosal immune system of the lung and intestine are responsible for evidence of bronchial hyperreactivity in patients with active IBD. Finally, it is important to recognize that extensions of the inflammatory process are not restricted to the development of organ-based events but may be responsible for some of the most frequent systemic abnormalities detected in IBD patients. It is now also well confirmed that the cytokine environment in IBD can support activated coagulation and, in some clinical situations, overt vascular thrombosis. The cerebrovascular complications of IBD are well recognized and range from peripheral venous thrombosis to central stroke syndromes and pseudotumor cerebri. Reports of focal white matter lesions in the brains of patients with IBD or an increased incidence of polyneuropathy may be other clinical examples of regional microvascular clotting. Microvascular injury appears to be more ubiquitously present, with reports ranging from a speculated primary causative role (e.g., granulomatous vasculitis in the mesenteric circulation) to the utility of nailbed vasospasm, in Crohn's disease, as a clinical marker for disease activity. It is also reported that IL-6 suppression of erythropoietin production is a major feature of the chronic anemia seen in active IBD. Moreover, the capacity of peripheral monocytes from active IBD patients to secrete TNF and IL-8 is reported predictive for the degree of therapeutic response from recombinant erythropoietin. These collected observations constitute another excellent example of the symmetry between basic science and clinical utility. It is from the context of applied basic science that many future therapies will arise. Empiricism will lose much of its appeal as clinical observations will be increasingly translated into cellular language. Already in animal models, elemental diets diminish IL-6-related acute inflammatory injury, and reductions in dietary lipid alter the antigenicity of bacteria. Provocatively, in humans, unconfirmed reports have even associated diet therapy with the resolution of uveitis and pyoderma gangrenosum. It is likely that efforts will also be made to induce oral tolerance if specific triggering proteins are discovered or to alter bowel flora if such an arcane area of investigation becomes resurgent.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is no established therapy for maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease. Following different suggestions from the literature, two potential interventions for maintaining remission were tested against placebo, using either 5 g/day of a highly concentrated omega-3 fatty acid compound or a carbohydrate-reduced diet (84 g/day). METHODS: A total of 204 patients were recruited after they had had an acute relapse. After remission (CDAI < or = 150) was attained with steroid therapy, patients were randomized to receive either omega-3 fatty acids (n = 70), placebo (n = 65), or diet (n = 69). Low-dose prednisolone was given to all patients for the first 8 weeks of intervention. CDAI and an acute-phase protein (CRP) were used as criteria for a relapse. RESULTS: The proportion of patients without relapse within a year were similar in the placebo and active treatment group (intention-to-treat analysis: placebo, 30%; active treatment, 30%; protocol-adhering patients, 29% versus 28%). Patients did gain benefit (53%; p = 0.023) for as long as they maintained the diet. However, intention-to-treat analysis (diet group, 40%) did not show a noticeable difference when compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Omega-3 fatty acids did not show an effect on extending the remission in Crohn's disease. For the diet patients the question remains whether the noncompliant patients dropped out early because they sensed a relapse approaching or whether their condition deteriorated because they failed to comply with the diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This prospective, open trial of treatment was conducted to determine whether cyclosporine A (CSA) is effective in inducing remission in children with severe, active Crohn's colitis refractory to other medical treatment and if remission may be maintained by 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) after discontinuing CSA. METHODS: Ten children (five males, five females), ages 1.2-16 yr (mean 11), all had failed to respond to 4 wk of treatment with i.v. methylprednisolone and total parenteral nutrition/elemental diet; three were already receiving 6-mercaptopurine. CSA was initially given as a twice daily i.v. dosage and was switched to oral CSA when a clinical response was observed. At the same time, corticosteroids were switched to the oral route and tapered over the next 3 months. Patients were grouped by treatment outcome. "Responders" were those who achieved remission with i.v. CSA therapy, "relapsers" were those who achieved remission with i.v. CSA but relapsed later, and nonresponders had not achieved remission after 4 wk of i.v. CSA. Responders were given 6-MP with intent to discontinue CSA after 6 months and maintain remission by 6-MP and 5-ASA. RESULTS: There were seven responders to CSA. For all patients, the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) (score range 0-100) had a mean value of 55 (range 40-65) just before treatment; PCDAI improved to a mean of 19 (range 5-42.5) after 2 wk of CSA therapy. Four of the seven responders discontinued CSA after 6 months and remain well on 6-MP and 5ASA alone for 22, 13, 8, and 3 months. One patient had massive GI bleeding (from active Crohn's colitis), which stopped within 48 h of CSA treatment. There were three relapsers (at 2-6 months of CSA), and three were nonresponders. Three patients who were already receiving 6-MP before CSA therapy either did not respond to CSA or relapsed while receiving it. The six nonresponders and relapsers required surgical resection. Transient side effects included hypertension responding to nifedipine in one child and hirsutism and tremors in another. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that CSA offers a good remission rate for children with severe Crohn's colitis failing other medical treatment, although relapse was common especially if the child was already on 6-MP. In addition, CSA may offer "temporizing" therapy in severe, active Crohn's colitis; this may allow surgery to be performed electively, with time for psychosocial and nutritional preparation before surgery.},

   abstract = {A clinical syndrome of chronic colitis unique to the sigmoid colon harboring diverticular was recently reported; its histopathological appearance has not been fully elucidated. In this study, the authors analyzed the clinical and pathological features of 23 patients (age range, 38-87 years; median age, 72 years) with diverticular disease-associated chronic colitis. Nineteen presented with hematochezia; four had abdominal pain. Colonoscopic visualization of the mucosa showed patchy or confluent granularity and friability affecting the sigmoid colon encompassing diverticular ostia. Colonic mucosae proximal and distal to the sigmoid were endoscopically normal. Mucosal biopsy specimens showed features of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease that included plasmacellular and eosinophilic expansion of the lamina propria (100%), neutrophilic cryptitis (100%) with crypt abscesses (61%), basal lymphoid aggregates (100%), distorted crypt architecture (87%), basal plasmacytosis (61%), surface epithelial sloughing (61%), focal Paneth cell metaplasia (48%), and granulomatous cryptitis (26%). Concomitant rectal biopsies obtained in five patients demonstrated histologically normal mucosa. Fourteen patients treated with high-fiber diet or antibiotics or both improved clinically, as did nine patients administered sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid. Five patients underwent sigmoid colonic resection, three for stricture with obstruction and two for chronic blood loss anemia. Among a control population of 23 age- and gender-matched patients with diverticular disease without luminal surface mucosal abnormality, none required resection during the same follow-up period. By Fisher's exact test, a statistically significant difference in outcome for patients with and without colitis was detected (p = 0.049). In addition, three patients developed ulcerative proctosigmoiditis 6, 9, and 17 months after the onset of diverticular disease-associted colitis. The data indicate that diverticular disease-associated chronic sigmoid colitis expresses morphological features traditionally reserved for idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease. Its clinical and endoscopic profiles permit distinction from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Patients with chronic colitis in conjunction with diverticula are at increased risk for sigmoid colonic resection. Diverticular disease-associated chronic colitis may also precede the onset of conventional ulcerative proctosigmoiditis in some cases.},

In a previous study a whole protein containing diet proved less effective than one in which food antigens were excluded, suggesting that exclusion of food antigens from the gut was a possible mechanism. This study was designed to test whether an oligopeptide diet of hydrolysed proteins was as effective as an amino acid based diet. These diets were equally antigen free but with different nitrogen sources. Forty four patients with active Crohn's disease were randomised in a controlled trial of amino acid versus oligopeptide diet. The feeds were given by nasogastric tube in equicaloric quantities and were the sole form of nutrition. Treatment was continued for four weeks although failure to improve by day 10 resulted in withdrawal. Quantitative leucocyte scintigraphy was used to investigate the effect of diet treatment on gut inflammation. Clinical and nutritional responses to treatment were also measured. Sixteen patients entered remission (including withdrawal of corticosteroids), six patients could not tolerate the nasogastric tube, and 22 patients failed to respond. The two diets were equally effective. Patients who responded had a rapid drop in clinical index of disease activity and a major reduction in the bowel uptake of leucocytes on scintigraphy. The oligopeptide and amino acid based enteral feeds were equally effective at inducing remission in active Crohn's disease. With both diets clinical improvement was accompanied by a reduction in intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) often flares up and requires frequent hospitalization and/or surgery. Cyclic home elemental enteral alimentation (C-HEEA) was developed to prevent flare-up of CD and to minimize patient hospitalization. However, its therapeutic efficacy has not been studied in a large patient population. Therefore, questionnaires were sent to members of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Research Group of Japan to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of C-HEEA and to define the factors that may affect the efficacy of the treatment. Data for 410 patients (C-HEEA-treated n = 322; drug-treated n = 88) were collected from 29 institutions and analysis showed the following results. The cumulative remission and non-hospitalization rates of the C-HEEA treated group were significantly higher than the rates of the drug-treated group in all patients and in those with ileitis and ileo-colitis (P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.01, respectively), but no significant difference was noted in patients with colitis. Cumulative remission and non-hospitalization rates were also influenced by the daily calorie content of the elemental diet (ED); more than 1200 kcal of the ED per day was found to be more effective than lower amounts to maintain remission and to prevent hospitalization. The therapeutic efficacy of C-HEEA was shown to be superior to that of drug treatment in patients with CD with ileal involvement, and it is suggested that more than 1200kcal per day should be supplied by the ED to enhance its therapeutic efficacy.},

   abstract = {The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown. Several potential mechanisms are discussed. The etiological and therapeutic importance of nutrition is controversial. Though changes in dietary habits and incidence of inflammatory bowel disease during the last century were in parallel, no specific nutritional factor has been isolated. No dietary prophylaxis of inflammatory bowel disease is yet known; all dietary therapies in inflammatory bowel disease aim to improve nutritional support and to diminish inflammation by bowel rest. Children and adolescents gain in weight and height. Total parenteral nutrition will not substantially reduce disease activity and operation rates. Total parenteral nutrition can only be recommended in ulcerative colitis patients with severe disease in the initial phase and in Crohn's patients with severe malnutrition and intestinal complications. Enteral nutrition support is less effective in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. Reported remission rates on enteral nutrition are 25% for ulcerative colitis and up to 80% for Crohn. However, in active Crohn's disease enteral nutrition is less effective than standard therapy with methylprednisolone and sulfasalizine. It is generally believed that nutrition therapy in combination with drugs is the best treatment modality. There is no evidence to support the importance of any combination of the formula diets such as elemental, oligopeptide, or polymeric formulations. Administration of formula diets by nasogastric tubes all show similar remission rates. Whether newer diets supplemented with arginine, glutamine, omega-3-fatty acids or short chain fatty acids increase remission rates is not known. Further studies in this field are warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To compare the effectiveness of defined-formula diets versus steroids for the treatment of active Crohn's disease, we conducted a meta-analysis of the published clinical trials. METHODS: Standard techniques for literature search were used to identify the pertinent trials. All studies included in our meta-analysis (n = 7) were aimed at comparing defined-formula diets versus steroids, using a randomized design. The patient-specific end-point of the meta-analysis was the occurrence of a treatment failure. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis indicated that steroids are more effective than defined-formula diets for inducing remission in active Crohn's disease. In fact, the relative risk of treatment failure (RTF) was significantly lower in the steroid group than in the diet group (risk values for patients given steroids compared with patients given diet: a) method of Mantel-Haenszel: RTF = 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.53; p < 0.001; b) method of Der Simonian & Laird: RTF = 0.43; 95% confidence interval, <0-0.94; p = 0.03). A separate analysis was carried out in which only the subgroup of patients who were not intolerant to diet were evaluated; this analysis also showed a superiority of steroids over diet. CONCLUSIONS: The data examined in this meta-analysis do not support the use of diets as primary treatment for acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease in adults.},

To determine which dietary constituents are of therapeutic importance, the effectiveness of four separate feeds was related to their compositions, and the findings substantiated by meta-analysis of previous dietary studies. 76 patients with active Crohn's disease were recruited. 17 were randomised to an amino acid-based elemental diet (E028), 22 to E028 with added long-chain triglyceride (E028 LCT), 18 to a semi-elemental, peptide based diet (Pepdite 2+) and 19 received E028 with added medium-chain triglyceride (E028 MCT). Disease activity fell in all groups and remission rate was negatively correlated with the amount of energy derived from LCT (r = -0.97, p = 0.016). Inflammatory indices fell in the groups (E028 + E028 MCT) containing least LCT. No other dietary constituents correlated with remission rate. A meta-analysis of published studies confirmed a negative correlation between remission rate and LCT (r = -0.63, p = 0.006) but not other constituents. The association between dietary LCT and remission rate may have pathogenic significance and allow the development of more effective enteral feeds.},

The Crohn's disease activity index was below 120 in all patients studied, who were treated with a low dose of corticosteroids (0.2-0.3 mg/kg body wt of prednisone). The average weight of Crohn's patients was significantly lower than that of controls (55.70 vs 70.50 kg, P < 0.001) due to both lower fat mass (9.97 vs 18.30 kg, P < 0.001) and lower lean body mass (45.72 vs 52.20 kg, P < 0.02). The average REE was significantly higher in the control group (1785.42 +/- 7.503 vs 1559.1 +/- 48.39 kcal/day, P < 0.001). However, these differences disappeared when REE was normalized by lean body mass (LBM) (34.49 +/- 2.56 vs 34.704 +/- 3.75 kcal/kg LBM P = NS). The nonprotein respiratory quotient was significantly lower in the patient group (0.823 +/- 0.031 vs 0.882 +/- 0.012, P < 0.025), indicating an increased lipid oxidation. This increased lipid oxidation might explain the reduced fat stores found in the group of Crohn's patients, suggesting also that a sufficiently lipid-rich diet could be useful in their nutritional management.},

   abstract = {Patients with a short bowel have usually had a bowel resection for Crohn's disease. Two types of short-bowel patient can be distinguished: those with a jejunostomy and those with their jejunum anastomosed to a functioning colon. Both types of patient have problems with macronutrient absorption, although those with a colon experience fewer problems because some energy from unabsorbed carbohydrate is salvaged in the colon. Patients with a jejunostomy have problems with large stomal losses of water, sodium and magnesium, whereas those with a jejuno-colic anastomosis rarely have problems with water and electrolyte absorption. Patients with a jejunostomy 100-200 cm from the duodeno-jejunal flexure ('absorbers') usually absorb more from the diet than they pass through the stoma and therefore require oral electrolyte or nutrient supplements. Those with a residual jejunal length of less than 100 cm usually secrete more from the stoma than they take in orally ('secretors') and therefore require long-term parenteral fluid or nutrient supplements. A high output resulting from a jejunostomy is treated by reducing the oral intake of hypotonic fluid, administering a sipped glucose-saline solution and, often, by giving drugs that reduce intestinal motility (most effective in absorbers) or gastrointestinal secretions (most effective in secretors). Gallstones are common both in short-bowel patients with and in those without a colon (45%), and calcium oxalate renal stones occur in the former (25%). However, it is now possible to provide adequate nutrition and fluid supplements for most patients with a short bowel, and the prospects for the rehabilitation of such patients are good.},

Disordered protein and carbohydrate metabolism have been reported in children with Crohn's disease, but little is known about their fat utilization. To assess fat oxidation, 13C-Hiolein was administered to 11 children with active Crohn's disease (age range, 10.5-16.9 years; mean, 12.6) before and after treatment with steroids. Expired breath samples were collected at hourly intervals for 12 h, and 13CO2 excretion was measured by mass spectrometry. The mean 95% confidence interval (CI) time to peak 13CO2 excretion was 9 h (range, 7.73-9.97) before treatment and 6.95 h (range, 5.75-8.15) after treatment (p < 0.02). Mean 95% CI cumulative 13CO2 excretion up to peak time (7 h) was 47.53% (range, 24-69%) before treatment and 68.7% (range, 35-80.5%) after treatment with steroids (p < 0.02). Our results demonstrated impaired lipid utilization during active disease and improvement following steroid treatment. The oral 13C-Hiolein test is simple and noninvasive, and its results are reproducible. It provides a new method for estimating fat utilization in paediatric patients, along with the possibility of discriminating between patients with and without impaired utilization during the acute phase of the disease.},

   abstract = {Nutrition and intestinal function are intimately interrelated. The chief purpose of the gut is to digest and absorb nutrients in order to maintain life. Consequently, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease commonly results in malnutrition and increased morbidity and mortality. For example, studies have shown that 50-70% of adult patients with Crohn's disease were weight-depleted and 75% of adolescents growth-retarded. On the other hand, chronic malnutrition impairs digestive and absorptive function because food and nutrients are not only the major trophic factors to the gut but also provide the building blocks for digestive enzymes and absorptive cells. For example, recent studies of ours have shown that a weight loss of greater than 30% accompanying a variety of diseases was associated with a reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion of over 80%, villus atrophy and impaired carbohydrate and fat absorption. Finally, specific nutrients can induce disease, for example, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, whilst dietary factors such as fibre, resistant starch, short-chain fatty acids, glutamine and fish-oils may prevent gastrointestinal diseases such as diverticulitis, diversion colitis, ulcerative colitis, colonic adenomatosis and colonic carcinoma. The role of dietary antigens in the aetiology of Crohn's disease is controversial, but controlled studies have suggested that elemental diets may be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing a remission in patients with acute Crohn's disease. In conclusion, nutrition has both a supportive and therapeutic role in the management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. With the development of modern techniques of nutritional support, the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic GI disease can be reduced. On the other hand, dietary manipulation may be used to treat to prevent specific GI disorders such as coeliac disease, functional bowel disease, Crohn's disease and colonic neoplasia. The future development of nutria-pharmaceuticals is particularly attractive in view of their low cost and wide safety margins.},

Changes in linear growth were better after treatment with an elemental diet compared with steroids (p < 0.001). Serum albumin and haematocrit concentrations all improved significantly in the children treated with an elemental diet (p < 0.001) but not in those treated with steroids. Thus an elemental diet was better than prednisolone in proximal disease and confirmed improved growth and nutritional status.},

However, it is not known whether there are corresponding changes in circulating phospholipids--the major source of fatty acids in the plasma. 2. Fasting plasma samples were obtained from 17 control subjects and 13 patients with active Crohn's disease [Simple Index of Crohn's Disease Activity (SICDA) > 6] before, and 2 and 8 weeks after, treatment with either a peptide diet or oral prednisolone. 3. Before treatment, the Crohn's disease patients had mildly active disease (SICDA 9.9 +/- 0.8, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 26.4 +/- 6.5 mm/h, serum C-reactive protein 2.8 +/- 0.4 mg/l). The proportions of the polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine species, 16:0-20:4 (10.0 +/- 0.7%) and 16:0-22:6 (7.1 +/- 0.8%), were both significantly higher than those in healthy controls (7.6 +/- 0.5%, P < 0.01 and 5.3 +/- 0.5%, P < 0.05 respectively). 4. After 2 weeks treatment, the SICDA in the Crohn's disease patients decreased to 3.2 +/- 0.6 (P < 0.0001 compared with the pretreatment value), and there were corresponding falls in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (to 12.6 +/- 2.7 mm/h, P < 0.05) and C-reactive protein concentration (to 1.7 +/- 0.3 mg/l, P < 0.05)--these improvements being maintained at 8 weeks. There was also a fall to normal values in 16:0-20:4 (to 7.7 +/- 0.6%, P < 0.01 compared with the pretreatment value) and in 16:0-22:6 (to 5.7 +/- 0.5%, P not significant), by week 8. 5. The proportions of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine molecular species were increased in the plasma of patients with active Crohn's disease, but fell to normal levels during disease remission. These observations are consistent with the theory that, in active Crohn's disease, the mucosal phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids are increased, contribute to eicosanoid synthesis and 'spill' into the plasma.},

Main target parameters included reduction of quality of life, intensity/frequency of abdominal pain, and grading of success of the most recent operation for Crohn's disease. These targets were correlated in univariate as well as multivariate statistics with 28 different parameters of general medical history, surgical pretreatment, actual somatic and psychosocial findings. Reduction of quality of life correlated with stool frequency, employment status, rectal involvement, hematochezia, liquid stools, extraintestinal manifestations and time since first operation (all with p < 0.05 in multivariate analysis; listed in decreasing levels of significance). Abdominal pain at time of interview was significantly associated with actual intake of corticosteroids, stool frequency, employment status, extraintestinal manifestations, dietary restrictions, and number of previous operations (other than laparotomies). Regarding success of most recent laparotomy important parameters included stool frequency, intake of corticosteroids, number of previous laparotomies, hematochezia, and history of enterostomy. Overall, parameters of disease activity were found to be more important than characteristics of medical history or previous surgery. Despite marked symptoms in many cases 92% of the patients regarded the most recent laparotomy to be fully or partially successful. The results provide direct and indirect evidence that besides momentary disease activity the individual personality profile may be far more important than type and number of previous surgery in coping with this chronic disease.},

   abstract = {Treatment of non-specific bowel inflammation (NBI) particularly of Crohn's disease (MD) and ulcerative colitis is very complicated, especially because of the fact, that in spite of atrial successful findings, the etiology of both main diseases of this group remain unknown. Nevertheless, manifestations, particularly in MC vary, often unexpectedly and surprisingly. Different medical teams elaborate therapeutic schedules, but none of them has been accepted world-wide. As it is still possible to state that NBI is untreatable by drug therapy, even the surgical removal of the affected part of the bowel does not protect against the relapse, it may indicate that no therapeutical approaches are sufficient at present. Using drug therapy, the biochemical chain of numerous inflammatory mediators is being tried to be disrupted. Despite the advances achieved, there are still many difficulties related to drug therapy. It is necessary to take into account the fact that the lack of knowledge in causative therapy and failure, poor response to initial therapy lead to the use of more new drugs. Therefore a careful consideration of every used or recommended drug is necessary. The principle of using Hylacombun (Merckle) in therapy was not applied due to the presumption of influencing the disease fundamentally, but due to an effort to reduce some symptoms of the disease, which deteriorate the life quality of patients. Data given by patients in questionnaires as well as biochemical and haematological parameters were evaluated statistically. Besides the commonly used Student t-test, we used Box and Whisker plots, linear trend analysis and the method of 9 aggregation numbers to follow both dynamics of the disease and drug effect. Laboratory, as well as the questionnaire data were equilibrated and graphically illustrated by the spline method. We found out that Hylacombun was effective in all patients. Subjective improvement was shown after 10 days of therapy, stabile improvement after 2 months. (Tab. 3, Fig. 7, Ref. 9.).},

The questionnaire covered six domains of health-related quality of life, including disease and its treatment, social, emotional, family, education, and future aspects. Crohn's disease affected education, with absenteeism in 12 and distraction during school work in six. Three children had had a home tutor, and five stated their need for one. Engaging in sports was a problem for eight children, mainly because of a lack of energy in five and the presence of a stoma in three children. Three children had missed every PE lesson in 1 year. Five children cited the social problem of being unable to stay over at friends' houses. Bullying concerned parents more than the children. Holiday difficulties included long distance traveling or lack of toilet facilities during school trips. Elemental diet was the preferred treatment, although the majority complained about the taste. Surgery was the most effective method of symptom control, though the resulting stoma was upsetting and restricted sports activities. Children on steroids had more depressive symptoms. Using the Rutter A Questionnaire, five children were designated "neurotic." Parents' views of the severity of symptoms significantly correlated with their children's views regarding rectal bleeding, poor growth, lack of energy, and poor appetite (p < 0.01). The main parental concerns were the side effects of medications and issues concerning their children's future, including schooling, job prospects, and marriage. The parents of 11 children cited problems with children's behaviour. The parents of seven cited disruption of work, and those of six named taking holidays. Crohn's disease in children, in addition to being a symptomatically disabling condition, has a great impact on the health-related quality of life of both sufferers and their parents. The questionnaire was a useful instrument, and with some adjustment it can be used again in large group studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies using indirect calorimetry in Crohn's disease have suggested that with weight loss there is a proportionally greater decrease in body fat along with a spring of lean mass. This study analyzed body composition (compared with that of controls) by direct methods in a group of 30 patients with active Crohn's disease and further evaluated the effects of nutrition support on body composition. METHODS: Total body protein was assessed by neutron activation, fat was assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, water was assessed by bioelectric impedance analysis, and potassium was assessed by gamma-ray technique. These measurements were repeated in patients with Crohn's disease after 3 weeks of enteral nutrition by feeding tube that provided 35 nonprotein kcal/kg of ideal body weight. RESULTS: Compared with age- and sex-matched controls, patients had lost (on average) 11.3 kg (16%) of body weight (p < .0005), including 5.1 kg (30%) of fat (p < .0005), 2.2 kg (19%) of protein (p < .025), 3.7 kg (10%) of water (p = NS), and 24.9 g (21%) of total body potassium (p < .01). After enteral feeding, body weight increased by 1.9 +/- 0.3 kg (p < .0005). Weight gain was accompanied by an increase in body protein (0.3 +/- 0.1 kg), fat (0.3 +/- 0.1 kg), and water (1.1 +/- 0.4 kg) (all p < .025), and by a nonsignificant increase in total body potassium. The weight gain of approximately 2 kg consisted of 65% water, 18% fat, and 18% protein, thus comprising a normal proportion of body composition. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced body weight in patients with Crohn's disease compared with that in controls was due to less fat tissue. With modest nutritional repletion, proportionate gains in all body compartments are possible.},

   abstract = {What have epidemiologic studies on IBD taught so far? Consistent findings are as follows: A high incidence of both CD and UC in industrialized countries and an increase in these areas of the incidence of CD during the years 1960-80 followed by a plateau phase, and a more stable pattern in UC during the same period have been found. A greater number of mild cases have probably been diagnosed recently. This also helps to explain the differences in severity and survival between community and referral centre groups. The male to female ratio is greater than 1 in UC, and this is the opposite in CD. Mortality of IBD has decreased during the past decades. As young people are especially prone to develop IBD, most of those affected will have their disease for many years. In developing IBD, genetic influences are of importance. However, epidemiologic studies strongly point to possible interactions between genetically determined features and environmental or other factors. Of these exogenic factors smoking is the most consistent, being of negative influence in CD and protective in UC. Diet and oral contraceptives may influence disease expression, and perinatal events such as viral infections may alter adult susceptibility. The question remains open whether UC and CD are one diseases entity. Similarities in the epidemiologic features of UC and CD support the idea of IBD being one disease. Other findings suggest dividing UC and CD into further subgroups: in CD it has been suggested that fibrostenotic, penetrating, and inflammatory behaviour should be considered different disease entities; in UC some groups consider ulcerative proctitis a disease entity on its own, separating it from the proximally extending colitis. In therapeutic trials this approach has proved to be of importance, and it is not inconceivable that in subgroups, with regard to aetiopathogenetic mechanisms, different factors have to be looked for.},

Even rectal 5-aminosalicylic acid has been found to be useful in maintaining long-term remissions of distal ulcerative colitis. Particularly noteworthy is the demonstrated efficacy of oral mesalamine in reducing recurrence rates of Crohn's disease following ileocecal resection, if introduced within the first few weeks after surgery. In all cases, the efficacy of the aminosalicylates is dose related, with little benefit demonstrable, at least in Crohn's disease, at oral doses < 2 g/day. In contrast to aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and cyclosporine are better suited to the induction of rapid remissions of acute disease than to the maintenance of long-term remissions. Antimetabolites, especially azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, are highly beneficial and relatively safe for long-term steroid-sparing therapy in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, at least for those patients whose initial remissions have already been induced by these agents.},

In rats with TNBS-induced colitis, feeding with an elemental diet (ED) plus 2% n-3 PUEA-rich perilla oil significantly suppressed plasma leukotriene (LT) B4 and ulcer index compared to that in rats fed with ED plus 2% n-6 PUFA-rich safflower oil (34.2 +/- 12.3 s 63.8 +/- 13.2 pg/ml and 8.8 +/- 12.1 vs 66.4 +/- 33.1, P < 0.01, respectively). Moreover, the plasma LTB4 and the ulcer index were significantly correlated (P < 0.05). Feeding with ED plus 2% alpha-linolenic acid (A-LA)-rich vegetable oil significantly reduced plasma LTB4 and colonic weight compared to that in rats fed with ED plus 2% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/docosahexaenonic acid (DHA)-rich fish oil in this model (61.6 +/- 10.5 vs 85.0 +/- 20.9 pg/ml and 0.83 +/- 0.13 vs 0.96 +/- 0.08g, P < 0.05, respectively). This study suggested that dietary fat manipulation with perilla oil can reduce colonic damage and that this is correlated with the suppression of plasma LTB4. The therapeutic efficacy of A-LA in controlling intestinal inflammation in experimental CD may be superior to that of EPA and DHA.},

The incidence and daily intake of each dietary component were compared annually from 1966 to 1985. The univariate analysis showed that the increased incidence of Crohn disease was strongly (P < 0.001) correlated with increased dietary intake of total fat (r = 0.919). animal fat (r = 0.880), n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (r = 0.883), animal protein (r = 0.908), milk protein (r = 0.924), and the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acid intake (r = 0.792). It was less correlated with intake of total protein (r = 0.482, P < 0.05), was not correlated with intake of fish protein (r = 0.055, P > 0.1), and was inversely correlated with intake of vegetable protein (r = -0.941, P < 0.001). The multivariate analysis showed that increased intake of animal protein was the strongest independent factor with a weaker second factor, an increased ration of n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The present study in association with reported clinical studies suggests that increased dietary intake of animal protein and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids with less n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may contribute to the development of Crohn disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some patients with inflammatory bowel disease have reduced bone mineral density, but the risk factors for osteoporosis in these patients are unclear. METHODS: To evaluate the effect of smoking and other lifestyle factors on bone mineral density in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, we studied 67 patients with ulcerative colitis, 78 with Crohn's disease, 7 with indeterminate colitis, and 73 healthy control subjects. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and the proximal femur was measured, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Measures of smoking and other lifestyle factors were assessed in an interview. RESULTS: The female ex- or current smokers with inflammatory bowel disease (n = 38) had lower age- and sex-adjusted Z-scores of bone mineral density than the female patients who had never smoked (n = 34) (Z-scores in the lumbar spine, -0.277 (1.283) (mean (standard deviation)) and 0.487 (1.056), respectively; p = 0.008; and in the femoral neck, -0.626 (1.055) and -0.013 (1.019); p = 0.015). These differences were not explained by the type or treatment of the disease, the menstrual history, or the use of estrogen preparations. In male patients no differences in bone mineral density were found between ex- or current smokers and non-smokers. Coffee drinking and alcohol consumption were not associated with bone mineral density in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is associated with low bone mineral density in women with inflammatory bowel disease. This association is not related to the body mass index, the medical treatment, or the type of disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Screening for inflammatory small bowel disease has hereto relied on barium examination, usually performed after duodenal intubation. A noninvasive technique for imaging of the small bowel in such patients would be preferable. METHODS: A total of 59 patients were included in the study. A small bowel barium examination (SBE) was performed after duodenal intubation using a barium and air double-contrast technique. Ultrasound (US) of the right lower quadrant was performed with a 3.5- or 5-MHz transducer. The patients fasted overnight. RESULTS: In 37 of 39 patients with a normal SBE, US was also normal. In 20 patients, SBE showed lesions compatible with Crohn disease and in 18 of these the US study showed thickening of the bowel wall. One of these patients later tested positive for Yersinia enterocolitica. There were two false-positive and two false-negative US examinations. For detection of inflammatory disease of the small bowel, US was calculated to have a sensitivity of 0.95, specificity of 0.93, accuracy of 0.93, predictive value of a positive test was 0.90, and a predictive value of a negative test was 0.95. CONCLUSIONS: US, therefore, seems to be a reliable method in the workup of patients suspected of having inflammatory small bowel disease. Thereby, US probably can select patients for SBF.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enteral nutrition regimens achieve remission from active Crohn's disease at rates comparable to steroids and total parenteral nutrition. Despite their increasing use there has to date been no assessment of patient tolerance or practical difficulties involved. METHODS: We investigated 147 treatments with elemental diet in 89 patients and followed this with an anonymous questionnaire. RESULTS: Sip feeding was successfully introduced in 85% with nasogastric feeding being necessary in 22 (15%). Nausea and postural hypotension were common in the first week of treatment but vomiting was only seen in three patients who were sensitive to the formula used. Two patients each had caffeine withdrawal symptoms and hypoglycemia and a further four had food-related night terrors. Our experience suggests that caution is necessary if this treatment is used in elderly subjects. Although the diets are perceived as being unpalatable, only six patients found taste to be a problem after the first week of treatment. The main problem with long-term treatment was the large daily volume requirement, which was overcome by increasing the concentration of the feed. Eighty percent of patients responded to the questionnaire, and 65% stated that they would opt for treatment with elemental diet again in the case of a further relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Elemental diet seems to be an acceptable and well-tolerated form of treatment in Crohn's disease.},

METHODS: We assessed sequential changes in disease activity (clinical and laboratory indices and faecal excretion of indium-111-labelled leucocytes) and nutritional status (anthropometry, body composition variables), hepatic secretory proteins (albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin), and trace elements (iron, magnesium, copper, zinc) during treatment of acute Crohn's disease with an elemental diet. RESULTS: Disease activity indices improved significantly by 2 weeks and were maintained at 4 weeks of treatment. There was a significant increase in pre-albumin at 4 weeks and an increase in serum iron and a decrease in serum copper during the study period. The changes occurring in the measures of nutrition did not correlate significantly with the changes in disease activity. CONCLUSION: The fact that changes in disease activity appear to precede any detectable changes in nutritional state, it suggests that the beneficial action of elemental diet in patients with active Crohn's disease is not due to an improvement in nutritional status.},

   abstract = {We present the operative technique of laparoscopic proctocolectomy along with the clinical course of the first four patients to undergo this procedure. The operation was conducted through five 12-mm ports. In total laparoscopic proctocolectomy, the dissection began with the sigmoid, left colon, and rectum. The gastrocolic ligament was opened at the level of the midtransverse colon and dissected along with the transverse mesocolon toward the splenic flexure. The attachments and vessels of the right side of the gastrocolic ligament and the right colon were taken last. This sequence was followed because gradual mobilization of the colon displaced all structures in the middle of the abdomen and obscured vision. The specimen was extracted through the anus. In laparoscopy-assisted proctocolectomy, it was necessary to incise only the white line of Toldt of the ascending and descending colon, mobilize the hepatic and splenic flexures, and ligate the vessels of the gastrocolic ligament. Then the vessels of the mesentery were ligated near the bowel wall through a 6.5-cm midline subumbilical incision from which the abdominal colon was also extracted. The rectum was then completely dissected and sectioned at 10-15 cm from the anus, everted, and resected at the dentate line. Mean operative time was 7 h, 18 min, and average blood loss was 493 ml. One patient had urinary retention. Return to liquid diet took a mean of 4 days. Average postoperative stay, which depended on full return of bladder function and teaching of stoma care, was 10 days.},

DESIGN: We studied dietary habits immediately prior to the onset of disease in 104 patients enrolled in a prospective, epidemiological study of the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Italy. METHODS: Each patient was interviewed using a recall questionnaire to provide information on the daily intake of nutrients. The differences in diet between patients and healthy subjects matched for age, sex and city of residence were determined. RESULTS: Our data confirm that patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have a high intake of total carbohydrate, starch and refined sugar. This resulted in a significantly higher relative risk (P < 0.001) in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. Total protein intake was significantly higher in ulcerative colitis, but not in Crohn's disease patients, than in controls. Fibre consumption did not differ between patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that carbohydrate consumption is significantly higher in IBD patients than in healthy controls. Ulcerative colitis patients also consumed more total protein than controls. The pathogenetic significance of these findings, however, remains unclear.},

DESIGN: A randomized controlled study. SETTING: The out-patient clinic of a tertiary centre (university hospital). PATIENTS: Seventy-five out-patients (31 men and 44 women, aged 16-77 years) with Crohn's disease. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were randomly assigned to receive either an oral supplement of 1000 IU/day vitamin D for 1 year or no supplement. Bone mineral density, assessed in the distal part of the nondominant forearm using single photon absorptiometry, and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, assessed using a competitive protein binding assay, were measured before and after the period of dietary supplementation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Relative change of bone mineral density. RESULTS: Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased in 57% of patients who received a supplement (compared with 37% of control patients). Bone mineral density decreased significantly in control patients [median -7%, interquartile range -12.6-(+0.4%)] but not in patients who received a supplement [median -0.2%, interquartile range -3.8-(+14%); P < 0.005]. Increases in bone mineral density were especially prevalent among patients who received the supplement and had normal serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (68%), whereas increases occurred in only 18% of patients with low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (P = 0.008). Patients without an intestinal resection and receiving the vitamin D supplement had a marginally greater increase in bone mineral content than patients who had undergone a resection (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Long-term oral vitamin D supplementation seems to be an efficient means of preventing bone loss in patients with Crohn's disease and could be recommended, especially for patients at high risk of osteoporosis.},

The study was undertaken in December. The nutritional status (height-weight index) was similar in both groups. The dietary vitamin D intake was as low in patient with CD (1.0 microgram/d; 0.5-1.3) as in the controls (1.1; 0.4-1.6) whereas the recommended daily intake is 5 micrograms/d. Vitamin D intake correlated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels in patients with low 25-OHD levels (tau = 0.45, p = 0.04). Bone mineral content (BMC)-measured by single photon absorptiometry on the radius- was decreased in 9 patients (31%) with CD. Patients with CD tended to have a lower sun exposure in summer (p = 0.10), which also correlated with BMC (p = 0.03). Hence, a specific diet with a high vitamin D content, or vitamin D supplementation is recommended in patients with CD to overcome the negative effects of low sun exposure on bone mineral density.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liquid diets given enterally combined with "bowel rest' are efficacious in the treatment of active Crohn's disease, but rapid recrudescence of gastrointestinal symptoms after resumption of a normal diet is common. AIMS: This study examined whether continuation of enteral nutrition as a nocturnal supplement to an ad libitum daytime intake of a normal diet increased the length of remission of Crohn's disease in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children and adolescents with active Crohn's disease treated successfully with exclusive enteral nutrition were classified retrospectively according to whether they continued supplementary enteral nutrition or not. Time to relapse and linear growth were compared between the two cohorts. RESULTS: Between January 1986 and December 1992, 65 patients aged 7-17 years (mean (SD) 13.6 (2.1) years) (36 males, 29 females) with Crohn's disease in exacerbation were treated for > or = four weeks by bowel rest and nasogastric tube feeding of an oligopeptide or amino acid based formula. At first follow up visit, remission (fall in Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index, PCDAI to < or = 20) was achieved in 47 of 65 (72%) patients. Subsequently, 20 of these 47 (43%) relapsed by six months and 28 of 47 (60%) by 12 months. Patients who continued nasogastric supplementary feeding (n = 28) after resumption of an otherwise normal diet remained well longer than those who discontinued nocturnal supplements completely (n = 19) (p < 0.02). Furthermore, continued use of nasogastric supplements before completion of puberty was associated with improved linear growth. CONCLUSION: After successful treatment of active Crohn's disease by exclusive enteral nutrition, supplementary enteral nutrition without restriction of normal diet is associated with prolongation of remission and improved linear growth in children and adolescents.},

   abstract = {Undernutrition is considered to have a central role in the pathogenesis of growth retardation in Crohn's disease. This may occur as a consequence of inadequate food intake, increased energy expenditure, or both. Ten growing adolescents with inactive Crohn's disease were assessed with respect to anthropometric parameters and resting energy expenditure, measured by indirect calorimetry during remission, repeated in relapse (N = 5), and compared to that predicted from the Harris-Benedict formula. Mean energy intake was assessed with seven-day diaries in five patients and compared to recommended intake for age, sex, weight, and physical activity. Ten healthy, growing, age- and sex-matched adolescents served as controls. Nine patients with inactive Crohn's disease, who had ceased growing, were matched for disease site and duration and acted as disease controls. Patients and disease controls had lower body mass index (19.2 +/- 0.6; 20.9 +/- 0.7) than healthy controls (23.7 +/- 0.6; P < 0.001). Percent body fat was lower in patients (13.2 +/- 1.9%) compared to healthy controls (20.5 +/- 2.4%; P < 0.05) but not to disease controls (17.0 +/- 2.6%). Patients had higher resting energy expenditure per kilogram of fat-free mass than disease or healthy controls (36.9 +/- 5.1; 32.9 +/- 2.6; 30.9 +/- 2.1 kcal; P < 0.02). Measured resting energy expenditure in patients, but not in disease or healthy controls, was higher than the predicted (measured: predicted 1.15, 1.03, 0.9, respectively; P < 0.03). Energy intake in patients was 97% of recommended intake but the measured ratio of energy intake/resting energy expenditure was lower than the predicted ratio (1.49 vs 1.71; P < 0.05). During subsequent relapse in five patients resting energy expenditure was unchanged. In growing adolescents with inactive Crohn's disease, there is increased energy expenditure that is not accompanied by an increase in energy intake. Relapse of disease does not appear to increase resting energy expenditure further but may "divert" energy from growth to disease activity. This suggests that nutritional therapy should be directed towards increasing caloric intake to maximize growth potential.},
