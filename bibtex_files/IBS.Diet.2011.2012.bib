   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is characterized by chronic abdominal symptoms and irregular bowel movements without any cause than can be revealed by routine diagnostic assessment. In recent years, its pathophysiology has come to be much better understood, and new therapeutic approaches have been developed. These advances were taken into consideration and assessed for their relevance to clinical practice in the framework of a new interdisciplinary S3 guideline. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature retrieved a total 5573 articles, from which 243 were selected on the basis of criteria relating to their form and content, individually assessed, and summarized in evidence tables. The recommendations formulated in this way were discussed in a Delphi procedure and a consensus conference, then accordingly modified and finalized. RESULTS: Variable symptom constellations are caused by disturbances of gastrointestinal regulation at multiple levels. The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome requires both chronic bowel symptoms that interfere with everyday life and the exclusion of relevant differential diagnoses. Its treatment is based on general therapeutic principles, dietary recommendations, psychological components, and symptomatic medication. Bulking agents, laxatives, spasmolytics, loperamide, and probiotic agents are recommended (with variable recommendation strengths), as are--for selected patients--antidepressants, 5-HT4 agonists, 5-HT3 antagonists, and topical antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The first German S3 guideline on irritable bowel syndrome translates up-to-date scientific knowledge as represented in current publications into concrete recommendations for diagnosis and treatment in clinical practice. In the future, it is likely that further causative pathophysiological mechanisms will be discovered; this should lead, in turn, to the development of new, causally directed treatments, which will supplement or replace the traditional, purely symptomatic treatments that are still in use today.},

   abstract = {Immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase is the single most efficient serological test for the diagnosis of celiac disease. It is well known that immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase levels correlate with the degree of intestinal damage, and that values can fluctuate in patients over time. Serological testing can be used to identify symptomatic individuals that need a confirmatory biopsy, to screen at-risk populations or to monitor diet compliance in patients previously diagnosed with celiac disease. Thus, interpretation of serological testing requires consideration of the full clinical scenario. Antigliadin tests are no longer recommended for the diagnosis of classical celiac disease. However, our understanding of the pathogenesis and spectrum of gluten sensitivity has improved, and gluten-sensitive irritable bowel syndrome patients are increasingly being recognized. Studies are needed to determine the clinical utility of antigliadin serology in the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity.},

For psychological treatment options, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, gut-directed hypnotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy, the evidence supporting their use in IBS patients is strong, but the availability limits their use in clinical practice. Dietary interventions are commonly included in the management of IBS patients, but these are primarily based on studies assessing physiological function in relation to dietary components, and to a lesser degree upon research examining the role of dietary components in the therapeutic management of IBS. Several probiotic products improve a range of symptoms in IBS patients. Physical activity is of benefit for health in general and recent data implicates its usefulness also for IBS patients. Acupuncture does not seem to have an effect beyond placebo in IBS. A beneficial effect of some herbal treatments has been reported.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate therapeutic potential of the immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based elimination diet among migraine patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). BACKGROUND: Food elimination has been suggested as an effective and inexpensive therapeutic strategy in patients with migraine and concomitant IBS in the past studies. METHODS: A total of 21 patients (mean [standard deviation] age: 38.0 [11.2] years; 85.7% females) diagnosed with migraine and IBS were included in this double-blind, randomized, controlled, cross-over clinical trial composed of baseline (usual diet), first diet (elimination or provocation diets), and second diet (interchange of elimination or provocations diets) phases and 4 visits. RESULTS: IgG antibody tests against 270 food allergens revealed mean (standard deviation) reaction count to be 23.1 (14.1). Compared with baseline levels, elimination diet per se was associated with significant reductions in attack count (4.8 [2.1] vs 2.7 [2.0]; P < .001), maximum attack duration (2.6 [0.6] vs. 1.4 [1.1] days; P < .001), mean attack duration (1.8 [0.5] vs. 1.1 [0.8] days; P < .01), maximum attack severity (visual analog scale 8.5 [1.4] vs. visual analog scale 6.6 [3.3]; P < .001), and number of attacks with acute medication (4.0 [1.5] vs. 1.9 [1.8]; P < .001). There was a significant reduction in pain-bloating severity (1.8 [1.3] vs. 3.2 [0.8]; P < .05), pain-bloating within the last 10 days (3.2 [2.8] vs. 5.5 [3.1]; P < .05), and improvement obtained in quality of life (3.6 [1.4] vs. 2.9 [1.0]; P < .05) by the elimination diet as compared with provocation diet. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that food elimination based on IgG antibodies in migraine patients who suffer from concomitant IBS may effectively reduce symptoms from both disorders with possible positive impact on the quality of life of the patients as well as potential savings to the health-care system.},

   abstract = {The potential relevance of systemic and gastrointestinal immune activation in the pathophysiology and symptom generation in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is supported by a number of observations. Infectious gastroenteritis is the strongest risk factor for the development of IBS and increased rates of IBS-like symptoms have been detected in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission or in celiac disease patients on a gluten free diet. The number of T cells and mast cells in the small and large intestine of patients with IBS is increased in a large proportion of patients with IBS over healthy controls. Mediators released by immune cells and likely from other non-immune competent cells impact on the function of enteric and sensory afferent nerves as well as on epithelial tight junctions controlling mucosal barrier of recipient animals, isolated human gut tissues or cell culture systems. Antibodies against microbiota antigens (bacterial flagellin), and increased levels of cytokines have been detected systemically in the peripheral blood advocating the existence of abnormal host-microbial interactions and systemic immune responses. Nonetheless, there is wide overlap of data obtained in healthy controls; in addition, the subsets of patients showing immune activation have yet to be clearly identified. Gender, age, geographic differences, genetic predisposition, diet and differences in the intestinal microbiota likely play a role and further research has to be done to clarify their relevance as potential mechanisms in the described immune system dysregulation. Immune activation has stimulated interest for the potential identification of biomarkers useful for clinical and research purposes and the development of novel therapeutic approaches.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the impact of dietary supplementation with a Bifidobacterium breve strain together with linoleic acid & alpha-linolenic acid, for 7 weeks, on colonic sensitivity and fatty acid metabolism in rats. Maternally separated and non-maternally separated Sprague Dawley rats (n = 15) were orally gavaged with either B. breve DPC6330 (10(9) microorganisms/day) alone or in combination with 0.5% (w/w) linoleic acid & 0.5% (w/w) alpha-linolenic acid, daily for 7 weeks and compared with trehalose and bovine serum albumin. Tissue fatty acid composition was assessed by gas-liquid chromatography and visceral hypersensitivity was assessed by colorectal distension. Significant differences in the fatty acid profiles of the non-separated controls and maternally separated controls were observed for alpha-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid in the liver, oleic acid and eicosenoic acid (c11) in adipose tissue, and for palmitoleic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in serum (p<0.05). Administration of B. breve DPC6330 to MS rats significantly increased palmitoleic acid, arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in the liver, eicosenoic acid (c11) in adipose tissue and palmitoleic acid in the prefrontal cortex (p<0.05), whereas feeding B. breve DPC6330 to non separated rats significantly increased eicosapentaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid in serum (p<0.05) compared with the NS un-supplemented controls. Administration of B. breve DPC6330 in combination with linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid to maternally separated rats significantly increased docosapentaenoic acid in the serum (p<0.01) and alpha-linolenic acid in adipose tissue (p<0.001), whereas feeding B. breve DPC6330 with fatty acid supplementation to non-separated rats significantly increased liver and serum docosapentaenoic acid (p<0.05), and alpha-linolenic acid in adipose tissue (p<0.001). B. breve DPC6330 influenced host fatty acid metabolism. Administration of B. breve DPC6330 to maternally separated rats significantly modified the palmitoleic acid, arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid contents in tissues.

Evidence is building to implicate fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) in the onset of abdominal pain, bloating, wind and altered bowel habit through their fermentation and osmotic effects. Hypersensitivity to normal levels of luminal distension is known to occur in patients with IBS, with consideration of food chemical intolerance likely to answer many questions about this physiological process. This paper summarizes the evidence and application of the most common approaches to managing food intolerance in IBS: the low-FODMAP diet, the elimination diet for food chemical sensitivity and others including possible noncoeliac gluten intolerance.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: : The aim of this study was to survey interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) patients with a Web-based questionnaire to determine which consumables (foods, drinks, supplements/spices, and general food categories) truly exacerbate IC/BPS symptoms. METHODS: : The Interstitial Cystitis Association posted a Web link on its Web site offering its members participation in the Web-based questionnaire from April 2009 to February 2010. Members were asked questions on the effect of 344 different foods, drinks, supplements, condiments/spices, and general food categories on urinary frequency, urgency, and/or pelvic pain symptoms. Members were asked to score symptoms related to consumables on a symptom Likert scale of 0 to 5. Questions on ethnicity, education, symptom duration, seasonal allergies, irritable bowel syndrome, and specific diets were included. RESULTS: : There were 598 complete responses to the questionnaire, and 95.8% of the participants answered that certain foods and beverages affected their IC/BPS symptoms. Most items had no effect on symptoms. Items that made symptoms worse were citrus fruits, tomatoes, coffee, tea, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, spicy foods, artificial sweeteners, and vitamin C. Only calcium glycerophosphate (Prelief; AK Pharma, Inc, Pleasantville, NJ) and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) had a trend toward improvement in symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: : Interstitial cystitis diets do not have to be overly restrictive. It is recommended that patients with IC/BPS avoid citrus fruits, tomatoes, coffee, tea, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, spicy foods, artificial sweeteners, and vitamin C. The use of calcium glycerophosphate and/or sodium bicarbonate before consumption of these trigger consumables may also help reduce sensitivity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its complications are thought to be infrequent in India; there are no data from India on the prevalence of and risk factors for GERD. The Indian Society of Gastroenterology formed a task force aiming to study: (a) the frequency and profile of GERD in India, (b) factors including diet associated with GERD. METHODS: In this prospective, multi-center (12 centers) study, data were obtained using a questionnaire from 3224 subjects regarding the frequency, severity and duration of heartburn, regurgitation and other symptoms of GERD. Data were also obtained regarding their dietary habits, addictions, and lifestyle, and whether any of these were related or had been altered because of symptoms. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate methods. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-five (7.6%) of 3224 subjects had heartburn and/or regurgitation at least once a week. On univariate analysis, older age (OR 1.012; 95% CI 1.003-1.021), consumption of non-vegetarian and fried foods, aerated drinks, tea/coffee were associated with GERD. Frequency of smoking was similar among subjects with or without GERD. Body mass index (BMI) was similar in subjects with and without GERD. On multivariate analysis, consumption of non-vegetarian food was independently associated with GERD symptoms. Overlap with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome was not uncommon; 21% reported difficulty in passage of stool and 9% had mucus in stools. About 25% of patients had consulted a doctor previously for their gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSION: 7.6% of Indian subjects have significant GERD symptoms. Consumption of non-vegetarian foods was an independent predictor of GERD. BMI was comparable among subjects with or without GERD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Despite increased prescription of a gluten-free diet for gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals who do not have celiac disease, there is minimal evidence that suggests that gluten is a trigger. The aims of this study were to determine whether gluten ingestion can induce symptoms in non-celiac individuals and to examine the mechanism. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled rechallenge trial was undertaken in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in whom celiac disease was excluded and who were symptomatically controlled on a gluten-free diet. Participants received either gluten or placebo in the form of two bread slices plus one muffin per day with a gluten-free diet for up to 6 weeks. Symptoms were evaluated using a visual analog scale and markers of intestinal inflammation, injury, and immune activation were monitored. RESULTS: A total of 34 patients (aged 29-59 years, 4 men) completed the study as per protocol. Overall, 56% had human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8. Adherence to diet and supplements was very high. Of 19 patients (68%) in the gluten group, 13 reported that symptoms were not adequately controlled compared with 6 of 15 (40%) on placebo (P=0.0001; generalized estimating equation). On a visual analog scale, patients were significantly worse with gluten within 1 week for overall symptoms (P=0.047), pain (P=0.016), bloating (P=0.031), satisfaction with stool consistency (P=0.024), and tiredness (P=0.001). Anti-gliadin antibodies were not induced. There were no significant changes in fecal lactoferrin, levels of celiac antibodies, highly sensitive C-reactive protein, or intestinal permeability. There were no differences in any end point in individuals with or without DQ2/DQ8. CONCLUSIONS: "Non-celiac gluten intolerance" may exist, but no clues to the mechanism were elucidated.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Awareness of the seriousness of irritable bowel disorder (IBS) remains low among clinicians. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of IBS and highlight the major personal, economic, and social burden of the disease, and the importance of adequate treatment of what is still often viewed as a trivial disorder. In fact, IBS is a major reason for referral. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: It is crucial that the varied pathophysiologies of this complex heterogeneous disease are understood in order to be able to treat both the presenting symptoms (pain, bloating, flatulence, abnormal defecation, diarrhea, constipation) and the underlying disorder effectively. Low-grade inflammatory and immune activation has been observed, but the precise triggers and mechanisms, and the relevance to symptom generation, remain to be established. TREATMENT: IBS patients require different treatment strategies according to the pattern, severity, frequency, and symptoms. While initial therapy traditionally targets the most bothersome symptom, long-term therapy aims at maintaining symptom control and preventing recurrence. In addition to dietary/lifestyle interventions and psychosocial strategies, a wide range of pharmacologic therapies are approved for use in IBS depending on the symptoms reported. Musculotropic spasmolytics, which act directly on intestinal smooth muscle contractility, such as otilonium bromide, are effective, particularly in the relief of abdominal pain and bloating, and are well tolerated in IBS. THE OBIS TRIAL: The recent large placebo-controlled Otilonium Bromide in Irritable Bowel Syndrome study demonstrated the superiority of otilonium bromide versus placebo not only in the reduction of pain and bloating, but also in protection from relapse due to the long-lasting effect.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food and diet are central issues that concern patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Few studies have thoroughly analyzed dietary intake in IBS. Our aims were to determine the nutrient intake in IBS patients in comparison to the general population, assess nutritional differences between IBS subgroups based on the predominant bowel habit or symptom severity, as well as to evaluate if their nutrient intake meet nutrition recommendations. METHODS: We included 187 IBS patients (mean 40.2 years; 139 women). They completed a 4-days food registration record, which was compared with an age-, and gender-matched control group (n = 374; 278 women) from a nation-wide dietary survey and with Nordic Nutrient Recommendations. KEY RESULTS: Daily nutrient intake in IBS patients was similar to the general population and met national nutrients recommendations. Irritable bowel syndrome patients had similar energy distribution from macronutrients compared to the control group, but the protein percentage tended to be higher. Irritable bowel syndrome patients also had significantly higher daily intake of vitamin E, folate, iron, vitamin C, and dietary fibers, as well as lower intake of vitamin A, riboflavin, calcium, and potassium. There was no association between nutrient intake and IBS subtypes or symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Although many IBS patients state that they avoid food items, this does not seem to influence their intake of nutrients to any large extent. The observed minor differences in nutrient intake indicate a tendency toward higher intake of fruit and vegetables and a lower intake of meat and dairy products in IBS patients.},

   abstract = {Again, we present a rich issue with great information to address common clinical questions. A common class of drug (proton pump inhibitors) and insufficiently common diet (high fiber content) are related to improved diabetes control. Four good health habits make a huge difference, especially for obese patients. Meaningful use is just not always that meaningful. Computed tomography scans for common chest complaints probably are overused in emergency rooms. Continuous insurance is important to receipt of prevention services, even for those with access to care when they do not have insurance. Practice-based research can be difficult to accomplish, yet can yield some good results--in this case, improved colon cancer screening rates. Consider hyperaldosteronism in patients with resistant hypertension. Reflect on the mistakes other family physicians report; we often learn from others' mistakes. Surgical mesh migration can cause many things, but would you guess it would cause symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome? A nice primer on what is known about chemoprevention of prostate cancer. And, how to influence care outcomes: high-leverage, not just measurable, activities.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will be discussed.},

The Life Sciences Research Organization, Inc. (LSRO) held a workshop, Prebiotics and the Health Benefits of Fiber: Future Research and Goals, in February 2011 to assess the current state of the science and the international regulatory environment for prebiotics, identify research gaps, and create a strategy for future research. A developing body of evidence supports a role for prebiotics in reducing the risk and severity of GI infection and inflammation, including diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, and ulcerative colitis as well as bowel function disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics also increase the bioavailability and uptake of minerals and data suggest that they reduce the risk of obesity by promoting satiety and weight loss. Additional research is needed to define the relationship between the consumption of different prebiotics and improvement of human health. New information derived from the characterization of the composition and function of different prebiotics as well as the interactions among and between gut microbiota and the human host would improve our understanding of the effects of prebiotics on health and disease and could assist in surmounting regulatory issues related to prebiotic use.},

The aim of the study was to establish the frequency and nature of reproductive function violation in patients with CD in the Russian Federation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 132 women (average age 38,5 +/- 1,17 years) with CD observed in CSRIG in the period from 2000 to 2010. Comparison group consisted 105 women (average age 38,7 +/- 1,6 years) with predominantly functional bowel disorders (irritable bowel syndrome, functional constipation, functional bloating, inert colon). Were took into account information regarding obstetric history, physical and laboratory signs of malabsorption syndrome (MS) study of antibodies to alpha-gliadin immunoglobulin (IG) A class (AGA) and tissue transglutaminase (AtTG). RESULTS: The average age of onset of menses was 14,3 +/- 1,4 years, and in the control group - 13,0 +/- 1,3 years (p > 0.05), half of patients with C (43.9%) had menstruation begun at age 15 years and older, while 7.6% of the women--aged 17 and older. In the comparison group menses beginning after 15 years was only at 13.3% of women. In 61.3% of patients with CD was irregular menstrual cycle while in the comparison group such violations were noted in 13.3% (p < 0.001). Prolonged periods of amenorrhea we observed in women with newly diagnosed GC 3 times more likely than the comparison group: 43.9% and 11.4% respectively (p < 0.01). They also had nearly 3 times more likely to occur spontaneous miscarriage: at 46.9% and 14.3% respectively (p < 0.01). The frequency of dead children birth was about the same: 2.3% and 1.9% respectively (p > 0.05). The frequency of reproductive disorders increased with the growth of the severity of MS. In 43% of women after 6-8 months of strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) had disappeared amenorrhea and there were regular menses. Three women of childbearing age, strictly abided the GFD and had a history of repeated spontaneous abortion during the year managed to get pregnant and give birth to healthy full-term baby. CONCLUSIONS: Reproductive disorders in women with celiac disease are significantly more likely than at women with functional bowel disease. One of the reasons of reproductive disorders in patients with CD can be malabsorption of necessary nutrients in the small intestine. The presence of reproductive disorders should be considered as a risk factor for celiac disease, so these women should be screened for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {This article explores possible relationships between migraine, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), celiac disease (CD), and gluten sensitivity. These seemingly distinct medical entities curiously share many common epidemiological, psychosocial, and pathophysiological similarities. Considerable evidence is emerging to support a concept that experiencing significant threatening adverse events creates a state of hypervigilance in the nervous system, which associates with exaggerated response to future threats and episodic attacks of migraine and IBS. While this sensitizing response is generally considered to reside in the central nervous system, it may be possible that the initiation resides in the enteric nervous system as well. What appears to link migraine, IBS, and CD is a disease model of a genetically sensitive nervous system transformed into one that is hypervigilant, and that over time can often develop disabling and pervasive disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to test in a double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled study the effects of a commercially available multi-strain symbiotic mixture on symptoms, colonic transit and quality of life in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients who meet Rome III criteria. BACKGROUND: There is only one other double-blinded RCT on a single-strain symbiotic mixture in IBS. METHODS: This is a double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled study of a symbiotic mixture (Probinul, 5 g bid) over 4 weeks after 2 weeks of run-in. The primary endpoints were global satisfactory relief of abdominal flatulence and bloating. Responders were patients who reported at least 50 % of the weeks of treatment with global satisfactory relief. The secondary endpoints were change in abdominal bloating, flatulence, pain and urgency by a 100-mm visual analog scale, stool frequency and bowel functions on validated adjectival scales (Bristol Scale and sense of incomplete evacuation). Pre- and post-treatment colonic transit time (Metcalf) and quality of life (SF-36) were assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-four IBS patients (symbiotic n = 32, 64 % females, mean age 38.7 +/- 12.6 years) were studied. This symbiotic mixture reduced flatulence over a 4-week period of treatment (repeated-measures analysis of covariance, p < 0.05). Proportions of responders were not significantly different between groups. At the end of the treatment, a longer rectosigmoid transit time and a significant improvement in most SF-36 scores were observed in the symbiotic group. CONCLUSIONS: This symbiotic mixture has shown a beneficial effect in decreasing the severity of flatulence in IBS patients, a lack of adverse events and a good side-effect profile; however, it failed to achieve an improvement in global satisfactory relief of abdominal flatulence and bloating. Further studies are warranted.},

   abstract = {Sulfur is both crucial to life and a potential threat to health. While colonic sulfur metabolism mediated by eukaryotic cells is relatively well studied, much less is known about sulfur metabolism within gastrointestinal microbes. Sulfated compounds in the colon are either of inorganic (e.g., sulfates, sulfites) or organic (e.g., dietary amino acids and host mucins) origin. The most extensively studied of the microbes involved in colonic sulfur metabolism are the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), which are common colonic inhabitants. Many other microbial pathways are likely to shape colonic sulfur metabolism as well as the composition and availability of sulfated compounds, and these interactions need to be examined in more detail. Hydrogen sulfide is the sulfur derivative that has attracted the most attention in the context of colonic health, and the extent to which it is detrimental or beneficial remains in debate. Several lines of evidence point to SRB or exogenous hydrogen sulfide as potential players in the etiology of intestinal disorders, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and colorectal cancer in particular. Generation of hydrogen sulfide via pathways other than dissimilatory sulfate reduction may be as, or more, important than those involving the SRB. We suggest here that a novel axis of research is to assess the effects of hydrogen sulfide in shaping colonic microbiome structure. Clearly, in-depth characterization of the microbial pathways involved in colonic sulfur metabolism is necessary for a better understanding of its contribution to colonic disorders and development of therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms suffer from food hypersensitivity (FH); their symptoms improve when they are placed on elimination diets. No assays identify patients with FH with satisfactory levels of sensitivity. We determined the frequency of FH among patients with symptoms of IBS and the ability of fecal assays for tryptase, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), or calprotectin to diagnose FH. METHODS: The study included 160 patients with IBS, 40 patients with other gastrointestinal diseases, and 50 healthy individuals (controls). At the start of the study, patients completed a symptom severity questionnaire, fecal samples were assayed, and levels of specific immunoglobulin E were measured. Patients were observed for 4 weeks, placed on an elimination diet (without cow's milk and derivatives, wheat, egg, tomato, and chocolate) for 4 weeks, and kept a diet diary. Those who reported improvements after the elimination diet period were then diagnosed with FH, based on the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, oral food challenge (with cow's milk proteins and then with wheat proteins). RESULTS: Forty of the patients with IBS (25%) were found to have FH. Levels of fecal ECP and tryptase were significantly higher among patients with IBS and FH than those without FH. The ECP assay was the most accurate assay for diagnosis of FH, showing 65% sensitivity and 91% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-five percent of patients with IBS have FH. These patients had increased levels of fecal ECP and tryptase, indicating that they might cause inflammation in patients with IBS. Fecal assays for ECP could be used to identify FH in patients with IBS.},

   abstract = {Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) are a group of disorders of the digestive system in which the chronic or recurrent symptoms cannot be explained by the presence of structural or tissue abnormality. This survey used a modified Rome III questionnaire on the health and nutrition status of a general population in Taiwan during 2005-2008. A total of 4,275 responders completed the questionnaire. The sample was evenly distributed for men (n=2,137) and women (n=2,138). The prevalence of FGID was 26.2%. Unspecified functional bowel disorder was the most prevalent (8.9%). The second was functional dyspepsia (5.3%), and the third were irritable bowel syndrome (4.4%) and functional constipation (4.4%). Women had a greater prevalence than males (33.2% compared to 22.4%, p<0.05) with regards to total FGID. Most categories of FGID were significantly prominent in women, except functional diarrhea. The FGID groups took fewer servings of vegetables and fruits than the non-FGID group each day (vegetables 2.51 vs 2.70, p<0.001; fruits 0.82 vs 0.91, p<0.001). Smoking, alcohol consumption, and betel nut chewing had no significant impaction on prevalence of FGID. The mean BSRS (brief-symptom rating scale) for screening depression and suicide ideation was higher in the FGID group (2.86 vs 1.63, p<0.001). In conclusion, FGID diagnosed with Rome III criteria are not uncommon in Taiwan's general population. Subjects who met the Rome III criteria for FGID in Taiwan were younger, had less vegetables and fruits intake, higher BSRS scores and were of greater female predominance.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Most studies on probiotics utilise single strains, sometimes incorporated into yoghurts. There are fewer studies on efficacy of mixtures of probiotic strains. This review examines the evidence that (a) probiotic mixtures are beneficial for a range of health-related outcomes and (b) mixtures are more or less effective than their component strains administered separately. RESULTS: Mixtures of probiotics had beneficial effects on the end points including irritable bowel syndrome and gut function, diarrhoea, atopic disease, immune function and respiratory tract infections, gut microbiota modulation, inflammatory bowel disease and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. However, only 16 studies compared the effect of a mixture with that of its component strains separately, although in 12 cases (75%), the mixture was more effective. CONCLUSION: Probiotic mixtures appear to be effective against a wide range of end points. Based on a limited number of studies, multi-strain probiotics appear to show greater efficacy than single strains, including strains that are components of the mixtures themselves. However, whether this is due to synergistic interactions between strains or a consequence of the higher probiotic dose used in some studies is at present unclear.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent papers highlight the role of the diet in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but very few population-based studies have evaluated this. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of IBS in the general urban population and to evaluate the type of diet associated with IBS symptoms. METHODS: A randomized sample of subjects (n=300) from a general urban population in Romania selected from family doctors' patient lists was invited for interview in the doctor's office. Selected subjects were evaluated for the diagnosis of IBS using Rome III criteria and for their eating habits and diet using a food frequency questionnaire. Socio-demographic factors and general medical history were also included in the interview together with standard weight measurements. Results from logistic regression were presented as odd ratios and 95 % confidence intervals. RESULTS: From the selected sample, 193 subjects (80 males, 113 women, mean age 50.8 +/- 16.2) agreed to participate (rate 64.3%). Prevalence of IBS was 19.1 % (19.4% for females and 18.7 % for males). IBS was associated with older age (1.05, 1.02-1.08, p <0.001) and past history of digestive diseases (5.0, 2.0-12.7, p<0.01). IBS subjects eat significantly more frequently canned food (23.74, 3.17-177.7, p<0.01), processed meat (4.7, 1.6-14.1, p<0.01), pulses (legumes) (4.0, 1.3-16.3, p<0.01), whole cereals (8.7, 2.0-37.8, p<0.01), confectionary (5.7, 1.8-23.2, p<0.01), fruit compotes (canned or not) (7.4, 2.5-23.1, p<0.001) and herb teas (4.0, 1.3-16.3, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study updates prevalence data and reveals a possible association between diet and irritable bowel syndrome.},

Participants in the control group received multistrain probiotic fermented milk with Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis; the participants in the test group received the same probiotic fermented milk mixed with dietary fi ber such as sea tangle extracts, radish extracts and glasswort extracts. The patients were treated for four weeks. RESULTS: Most of the symptoms of IBS, with the exception of fl atulence, stool consistency, and frequency of defecation, signifi cantly improved in both groups. In the analysis of IBS subtypes, especially constipation-predominant IBS, the frequency and duration of defecation and straining at stool were improved more in the test group than in the control group.

A systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science was conducted. Included were full-length, peer-reviewed, English-language articles in which psyllium ingestion was tested for its effect on IBS symptoms. Quality of these articles also was assessed. Twelve met the criteria for complete data abstraction. Seventy-five percent of the studies examined were of weak quality. Study designs and methods were heterogeneous. Patient-perceived global symptoms improved significantly in six of the nine studies measuring a global symptom outcome. In one study, significant improvements occurred in reported abdominal pain; in three, improvement did not occur. Quality of life and flatulence did not improve significantly in any studies in which these outcomes were examined. The results of this systematic review indicate limited and conflicting evidence to support the recommendation of psyllium supplementation for symptomatic IBS treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Manipulation of dietary fibre intake represents a longstanding treatment for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), particularly for those with constipation. Linseeds are often recommended by both clinicians and dietitians as a source of dietary fibre to alleviate symptoms. Recent guidance on the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) advises that linseeds may reduce wind and bloating, although there is limited clinical evidence to support this recommendation. The present pilot study aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of: (i) whole linseeds versus ground linseeds; (ii) whole linseeds versus no linseeds; and (iii) ground linseeds versus no linseeds in the management of IBS symptoms. METHODS: In an open randomised controlled trial, subjects with IBS (n = 40) were allocated to one of three intervention groups: two tablespoons of whole linseeds per day (n = 14), two tablespoons of ground linseeds per day (n = 13) and no linseeds as controls (n = 13). Symptom severity (primary outcome) and bowel habit were assessed before and after a 4-week intervention and statistical differences between the groups were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects completed the present study. Between-group analysis comparing the improvement in symptom severity did not reach statistical significance for whole linseeds (n = 11) versus ground linseeds (n = 11; P = 0.62), whole linseeds versus controls (n = 9; P = 0.12) and ground linseeds versus controls (P = 0.10). There were no significant changes in stool frequency or stool consistency for any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Linseeds may be useful in relief of IBS symptoms. Further research is needed to detect clear differences between the effects of whole and ground linseeds.},

Diagnosis of hypertension needs several measurements and may need 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Glycosylated hemoglobin is a reliable tool to diagnose diabetes mellitus. The ABCD2 score with neurological imaging help the triage of transient ischemic attacks. Pulmonary embolism can be treated as outpatient for low risk patients. Gluten-free diet may be tried in irritable bowel syndrome. Nitrofurantoin is a reasonable alternative for simple urinary tract infection in women, but antibiotics are not needed after drainage of an uncomplicated skin abscess. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is a risk factor of osteoporosis in older men. Sequential use of MMSE and ACE scores is a promising approach to assess medical decision-making capacity.},

   abstract = {Human biology can only be fully assessed by combining an analysis of both the host and its surrounding environment. As a part of the environment, the human gastrointestinal tract hosts more than 100 trillion bacteria making up the gut microbiota. The human host provides a nutrient-rich environment while the microbiota provides indispensable functions that humans cannot exert themselves. Shifts in the bacterial makeup of the human gut microbiota have been associated with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome and obesity. However, since most bacteria inhabiting our gut are not cultivable to date, until recently little was known about their individual functions. Metagenomics, i.e. the analysis of the collective genomes present in a defined ecosystem, gives insight into these specific functions. The first extensive catalogue of the intestinal metagenome outnumbers the size of the human genome by a factor of 150. Recently, 3 distinct 'types' of gut composition within the human population have been highlighted. These so-called 'enterotypes' are characterized by the dominant genera (Bacteroides, Prevotella and Ruminococcus) and their co-occurring phylogenetic groups. In accordance with the previously described impact of nutritional behavior (diet, probiotics and prebiotics) on specific bacterial populations, an association has been observed between long-term dietary habits and enterotypes. This recent discovery, i.e. that belonging to one or the other enterotype might be modulated by the diet opens up new perspectives in the fields of IBD, nutrition and therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of intra- and extra-cranial venous system impairment in the pathogenesis of various vascular, inflammatory and neurodegenerative neurological disorders, as well as in aging, has not been studied in detail. Nor have risk factors been determined for increased susceptibility of venous pathology in the intra-cranial and extra-cranial veins. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between presence of a newly proposed vascular condition called chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) and environmental factors in a large volunteer control group without known central nervous system pathology. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The data were collected in a prospective study from 252 subjects who were screened for medical history as part of the entry criteria and participated in the case-control study of CCSVI prevalence in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and then were analyzed post-hoc. All participants underwent physical and Doppler sonography examinations, and were assessed with a structured environmental questionnaire. Fullfilment of >/= 2 positive venous hemodynamic (VH) criteria on Doppler sonography was considered indicative of CCSVI diagnosis. Risk and protective factors associated with CCSVI were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Seventy (27.8%) subjects presented with CCSVI diagnosis and 153 (60.7%) presented with one or more VH criteria. The presence of heart disease (p = .001), especially heart murmurs (p = .007), a history of infectious mononucleosis (p = .002), and irritable bowel syndrome (p = .005) were associated with more frequent CCSVI diagnosis. Current or previous smoking (p = .029) showed a trend for association with more frequent CCSVI diagnosis, while use of dietary supplements (p = .018) showed a trend for association with less frequent CCSVI diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for CCSVI differ from established risk factors for peripheral venous diseases. Vascular, infectious and inflammatory factors were associated with higher CCSVI frequency.},

   abstract = {Inflammation is a hot topic in medical research, because it plays a key role in inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other forms of arthritis, diabetes, heart diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, allergies, asthma, even cancer and many others. Over the past few decades, it was realized that the process of inflammation is virtually the same in different disorders, and a better understanding of inflammation may lead to better treatments for numerous diseases. Inflammation is the activation of the immune system in response to infection, irritation, or injury, with an influx of white blood cells, redness, heat, swelling, pain, and dysfunction of the organs involved. Although the pathophysiological basis of these conditions is not yet fully understood, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have often been implicated in their pathogenesis. In fact, in inflammatory diseases the antioxidant defense system is compromised, as evidenced by increased markers of oxidative stress, and decreased levels of protective antioxidant enzymes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An enriched diet containing antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-carotene and phenolic substances, has been suggested to improve symptoms by reducing disease-related oxidative stress. In this respect, the marine world represents a largely untapped reserve of bioactive ingredients, and considerable potential exists for exploitation of these bioactives as functional food ingredients. Substances such as n-3 oils, carotenoids, vitamins, minerals and peptides provide a myriad of health benefits, including reduction of cardiovascular diseases, anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. New marine bioactives are recently gaining attention, since they could be helpful in combating chronic inflammatory degenerative conditions. The aim of this review is to examine the published studies concerning the potential pharmacological properties and application of many marine bioactives against inflammatory diseases.},

However, they have not been tested for use in functional gastric disease. We therefore investigated if strains previously shown to protect from response to colorectal distension (CRD) in rats also modulate response to gastric distension (GD). Healthy, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with viable, heat-killed, gamma-irradiated Lactobacillus reuteri or viable Lactobacillus plantarum wild type (WT), L. plantarum Dlt mutant, conditioned medium or medium control (9 d), and subjected to GD under anesthesia using an i.g. Teflon catheter. Effects were measured by heart rate (HR) changes during noxious distension (60 mm Hg) compared to baseline HR values. We also investigated the localization of viable, green fluorescent protein-transfected bacteria in the stomach mucosa. Viable L. reuteri decreased the bradycardia induced by noxious GD compared to placebo controls (P < 0.001). Heat-killed or gamma-irradiated L. reuteri and conditioned medium did not have a protective effect in GD. Viable L. plantarum WT and Dlt mutant, previously shown to be effective antinociceptive agents in CRD, showed no protective effect in GD. All viable bacteria were associated with the pars glandularis of the rat stomach. Thus, we conclude that the antinociceptive mechanisms of action of probiotic bacteria differ between the stomach and the colon. Symptom alleviation cannot be attributed to the localization of the bacteria in the stomach. Information derived from effects of CRD cannot be extrapolated to effects in the stomach, which are likely to be strain and organ specific.},

This cross-sectional study included 146 patients with chronic diarrhea. They were 87 males and 59 females, with age ranging between 2 and 198 months and a mean age of 27.3 +/- 34.5 months. Each patient was subjected to medical history taking including age of onset and duration of diarrhea, consistency of stools, presence of blood and mucus, vomiting with or without hematemesis, fever, allergic manifestations and family history of atopy. Dietetic history included milk feeding during the first 6 months and age of weaning and age of introduction of cow's milk products. Anthropometric measurements included weight and height and weight for height were assessed and z-scores were calculated using software WHO anthro v3.2.2. Laboratory investigations included stool analysis and culture, CBC and all other investigations necessary for diagnosis of the definite cause including RAST for specific IgE against cow's milk proteins, serology for celiac disease (anti-gliadin and anti tTG), Breath hydrogen test, endoscopy (colonoscopy or esophago-gastrodudenoscopy) and histopathologic assessment of endoscopic biopsies. CMA was diagnosed on basis of withdrawal and open re-challenge technique. Causes included chronic infections (40.4%), CMA (34.9%), celiac disease (10.3%), inflammatory bowel disease (6.8%) and lactose intolerance (3.4%). Rare causes were chronic non-specific diarrhea (1.3%), cystic fibrosis (0.7%), post-surgery short bowel syndrome (0.7%), neuroblastoma (0.7%) and IBS (0.7%).78.7% of patients enrolled in the study had a low WFA z-score (< -2), 75% had low length for age z-score (<-2) and 50.7% showed wasting with low weight for height z-scores (< -2). Patients with IBD had the lowest mean value of WFA and HFA z-scores (-4.03 +/- 3.23, -6.31 +/- 3.74 respectively). Infants with CMA had the lowest mean value of WFH z-score (-2.26 +/- 1.78).},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal (GI) disorder that considerably reduces the quality of life. It further represents an economic burden on society due to the high consumption of healthcare resources and the non-productivity of IBS patients. The diagnosis of IBS is based on symptom assessment and the Rome III criteria. A combination of the Rome III criteria, a physical examination, blood tests, gastroscopy and colonoscopy with biopsies is believed to be necessary for diagnosis. Duodenal chromogranin A cell density is a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of IBS. The pathogenesis of IBS seems to be multifactorial, with the following factors playing a central role in the pathogenesis of IBS: heritability and genetics, dietary/intestinal microbiota, low-grade inflammation, and disturbances in the neuroendocrine system (NES) of the gut. One hypothesis proposes that the cause of IBS is an altered NES, which would cause abnormal GI motility, secretions and sensation. All of these abnormalities are characteristic of IBS. Alterations in the NES could be the result of one or more of the following: genetic factors, dietary intake, intestinal flora, or low-grade inflammation. Post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease-associated IBS (IBD-IBS) represent a considerable subset of IBS cases. Patients with PI- and IBD-IBS exhibit low-grade mucosal inflammation, as well as abnormalities in the NES of the gut.},

   abstract = {Most patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) believe that diet plays a significant role in inducing IBS symptoms and desire to know what foods to avoid. It has been found that the intake of calories, carbohydrates, proteins and fat by IBS patients does not differ from that of the background population. IBS patients were found to avoid certain food items that are rich in fermentable oligo-, di- and monosacharides and polyols (FODMAPs), but they did have a high consumption of many other FODMAP-rich food items. The diet of IBS patients was found to consist of a low calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamin B2 and vitamin A content. There is no consistent evidence that IBS patients suffer from food allergy, nor is there documented evidence that food intolerance plays a role in IBS symptoms. Abnormalities in gut hormones have been reported in IBS patients. As gut hormones control and regulate gastrointestinal motility and sensation, this may explain the abnormal gastrointestinal motility and visceral hypersensitivity reported in these patients. Guidance concerning food management which includes individually based restrictions of FODMAP-rich food items and individual evaluation of the effects of protein-, fat- and carbohydrate-rich/poor diets may reduce IBS symptoms.},

Additional conditions and symptoms included Raynaud syndrome, fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome associated constipation (IBS-C), gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), menopausal symptoms, chronic urinary tract and upper respiratory infections, and weight gain. She was taking Arthrotec (a combination of diclofenac and misoprostol - for pain and inflammation), Fosamax Plus D (alendronate with vitamin D3 - recently prescribed because of low bone density), and Catapres (clonidine - for menopausal symptoms). Against the advice of her rheumatologist, she had recently discontinued taking Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine), methotrexate, and prednisone due to significant side effects. Lab tests to identify underlying imbalances and to direct treatment were ordered. Treatment included dietary, nutritional, hormonal, and mind/body support. After one year of therapy, the patient experienced improvement with all of her presenting conditions and symptoms, which enabled her to discontinue several medications. She became versed in identifying and avoiding the environmental triggers of her disease, including foods (dairy, wheat, eggs, and soy), molds, and emotional stress. Antinuclear antibodies were normalized. She experienced a 7.5-percent improvement in left trochanteric bone density - comparable to bisphosphonate therapy. Mild improvements were also noted in the spine and bilateral femoral neck.},

Material and Methods. Nursing home residents above 60 years of age were included. Demographics, diet, physical activity, activity of daily living, nutritional status, use of drugs, and diseases were recorded. Constipation was defined as functional constipation or constipation-predominant IBS according to the Rome III criteria and/or regular use of laxatives. Drugs were classified according to the Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical Classification System (ATC), and anticholinergic effect was noted. Results. In all, 79 men and 188 women with a mean age of 85.4 (SD 7.1) years were included. The prevalence of constipation was 71.5%. Use of drugs in general, including polypharmacy, was not associated with constipation. Reduced activity of daily living (OR = 0.71, 95% CI : 0.60-0.84, P < 0.001), other antidepressants (N06AX) (OR 3.08, 95% CI : 1.09-8.68, P = 0.03), and benzodiazepine derivatives (N05BA) (OR = 2.80, 95% CI : 1.12-7.04, P = 0.03) were significantly associated with constipation; drugs with markedly anticholinergic effect (OR = 3.7, 95% CI : 0.78-17.53, P = 0.10), natural opium alkaloid (N02AA) (OR = 5.01, 95% CI : 0.95-25.94, P = 0.06), and propionic acid derivatives (M01AE) (OR = 7.00, 95% CI : 0.75-65.08, P = 0.09) showed a trend. Conclusion. In elderly with constipation, focus should be on specific groups of drugs and nonpharmacological factors, not on drugs in general.},

   abstract = {What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Nearly 90% of patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) report sensitivities to a wide variety of dietary comestibles. Current questionnaire-based literature suggests that citrus fruits, tomatoes, vitamin C, artificial sweeteners, coffee, tea, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, and spicy foods tend to exacerbate symptoms, while calcium glycerophosphate and sodium bicarbonate tend to improve symptoms. At present we recommend employing a controlled method to determine dietary sensitivities, such as an elimination diet, in order to identify sensitivities while at the same time maintain optimal nutritional intake. We review current literature with regard to diet's effect upon IC/BPS and common comorbidities (irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, neuropathic pain, vulvodynia, and headache) with a focus upon questionnaire-based investigations. We discuss the pathologic mechanisms that may link diet and IC/BPS related-pain, concentrating upon specific comestibles such as acidic foods, foods high in potassium, caffeine, and alcohol. Up to 90% of patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) report sensitivities to a wide variety of comestibles. Pathological mechanisms suggested to be responsible for the relationship between dietary intake and symptom exacerbation include peripheral and/or central neural upregulation, bladder epithelial dysfunction, and organ 'cross-talk', amongst others. Current questionnaire-based data suggests that citrus fruits, tomatoes, vitamin C, artificial sweeteners, coffee, tea, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, and spicy foods tend to exacerbate symptoms, while calcium glycerophosphate and sodium bicarbonate tend to improve symptoms. Specific comestible sensitivities varied between patients and may have been influenced by comorbid conditions. This suggests that a controlled method to determine dietary sensitivities, such as an elimination diet, may play an important role in patient management.},

Pathogenesis of IBD is discussed connecting microbial flora, host immunity, and genetic interactions. The best studied genetic example, NOD2 in Crohn's disease, is highlighted as a model which encompasses these interactions and has been shown to depend on butyrate for normal function. The role of these opposing concepts in management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is contrasted with what is known in IBD. The conclusion reached is that, while both approaches may alleviate symptoms in both IBS and IBD, there is insufficient data yet to determine whether both approaches lead to equivalent bacterial effects in mollifying the immune system. This is particularly relevant in IBD. As such, caution is urged to use long-term carbohydrate withdrawal in IBD in remission to control IBS-like symptoms.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frequent and invalidating functional bowel disorder with entangled mechanisms. Its therapeutic approach is therefore complex. Classical therapies, prescribed alone or in combination in light of the predominant symptom, consist of antispasmodics, fibers, laxatives, antidiarrheals, and psychotropic agents. Other emerging pharmacological therapies, such as prokinetics, prosecretory or serotoninergic agents, bile acid modulators and antibiotics have been recently studied in clinical trials. Dietary measures can include reduction of short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates (FODMAPs) and gluten restriction. Assessment of food allergy can be proposed in a subgroup of IBS patients. Complementary and alternative medicine therapies, that are generally low cost and safe, appear to be appreciated by patients. Probiotics have demonstrated action on the gut microbiote modulation, and may be helpful in a subset of patients. Peppermint oil has an established visceral analgesic effect. Hypnotherapy represents an original, global and effective approach. Finally, education, reassurance and listening to the patient, leading to a solid therapeutic relationship, represents an essential backdrop of remedy or diet effectiveness.},

Most patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia are found to have FD. Patients with FD are usually young and there is no predilection to any gender. Overlap of FD with other functional bowel diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease is common in Asia. Cultural difference in reporting of symptoms of dyspepsia is well-known. Moreover, dietary factors, socio-cultural and psychological issues, gastrointestinal infection including that caused by Helicobacter pylori, frequency of organic diseases such as peptic ulcer and gastric cancer responsible for dyspeptic symptoms in the study population may also influence epidemiology of dyspepsia. There is considerable heterogeneity in the above issues among different Asian countries. More studies on epidemiology of FD are needed in Asia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Food-related symptoms are commonly described by patients with functional bowel disorders, but dietary change as an evidence-based therapy has not been part of routine management strategies. This reviews aims to discuss strategies commonly applied. METHOD: Published literature was reviewed. RESULTS: Traditional approaches involve elimination diets followed by placebo-controlled reintroduction of specific foods, which is tedious at best and not applied in routine practice. Pathogenically-based approaches include determining what food components are inducing food hypersensitivity responses using specific biomarkers, but this is probably applicable to a small proportion of patients only and has met with only limited success. Food bioactive chemicals, such as salicylates, have been targeted, but there is a paucity of quality evidence for or against this approach. In contrast, targeting poorly absorbed dietary components that might induce luminal distension via osmotic effects and rapid fermentation (FODMAPs) has been successful and the efficacy of the dietitian-delivered low FODMAP diet is now supported by high quality evidence. Improvement of all symptoms of FBD in three out of four patients has been achieved. The diet may potentially improve stool frequency in patients with an ileal pouch or a high output ileostomy, or functional symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. FODMAPs in enteral formulas may also be responsible for diarrhoea induced by enteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: Dietary restriction of FODMAPs is an effective therapy in the majority of patients with functional bowel symptoms and, provided dietitians are trained in the technique, should be first line therapy.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are live microbial organisms that are present in foods or dietary supplements and that confer health benefits to the host when ingested in sufficient quantities. Probiotics can be bacterial (e.g. Bifidobacteria spp. and Lactobacillus spp.) or yeasts (e.g. Saccharomyces boulardii). The administration of probiotics is often believed to be by and large beneficial for individuals with inflammatory or infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. These positive effects are generally attributed to the ability of probiotics to regulate intestinal permeability, normalize host intestinal flora, improve gut immune barrier function, and equilibrate the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Of note, however, these claims are not always substantiated by findings from properly conducted clinical trials. Of particular importance, even when results from randomized controlled trials support the beneficial effects of a particular probiotic for a specific indication, the benefits achieved by the probiotic are generally not translatable to other probiotic formulations. This review discusses the gastrointestinal indications for probiotic use and describes the level of evidence that supports the use of specific probiotics for these indications. Several indications are addressed, including enteric infections, gastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori infection, necrotizing enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {There is an undeniable link between gastrointestinal disorders and malnutrition. Chronic diarrhoea is one of the most common gastrointestinal conditions that can impact a patient's nutritional status. The nutritional consequences will depend on the cause of the diarrhoea as well as the location and extent of gastrointestinal involvement. In general, malabsorption plays a central role in the interaction between malnutrition and chronic diarrhoea. Malabsorption can result in both nutritional deficits and diarrhoea. With severe malnutrition, chronic diarrhoea can persist due to impaired immune function and poor mucosal recovery. Food intolerance and an inappropriate diet in the setting of malabsorption may also contribute to chronic diarrhoea. Patients may attribute their gastrointestinal symptoms to specific dietary intake, which can lead to self-imposed indiscriminate dietary restrictions. Therefore, disease-specific treatment in conjunction with appropriate nutritional counselling and intervention is recommended in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in patients with chronic diarrhoea. Specialized nutritional support through enteral or parenteral administration may be required to treat severe caloric and micronutrient deficiencies. In this review, we aim to summarize the mechanism, diagnosis, and treatment of the nutritional consequences of chronic diarrhoea.},

METHODS: Specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against 14 common food antigens in the serum were measured in 77 patients with D-IBS and 26 healthy controls. Food-specific IgG antibodies were identified in 39 (50.65%) patients with D-IBS patients compared with four (15.38%) controls. For 12 weeks following the serological testing, 35 patients with D-IBS and food intolerance consumed diets that excluded the identified food. Changes in the main symptoms of D-IBS were evaluated before treatment and regularly during treatment in these patients. RESULTS: After 4 weeks' dietary therapy, most symptoms of D-IBS had improved. By 12 weeks, all symptom scores had decreased significantly compared with the baseline scores. CONCLUSIONS: The 12-week specific-food exclusion diets resulted in significant improvements in abdominal pain (bloating level and frequency), diarrhoea frequency, abdominal distension, stool shape, general feelings of distress and total symptom score compared with baseline in patients with D-IBS.},

   abstract = {There is growing evidence that many aspects of our lifestyle and the environment we now live in contribute to the development of disease. The luminal digestive tract is a clear target of the influence of dietary components, alcohol, microbial organisms, and other ingested materials. External factors including obesity, lack of physical exercise, and tobacco consumption also impact diseases of the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A growing understanding of the microbiome which forms an integral part of the human organism indicates that this is another important external force that impacts human health and disease. The luminal GI tract conditions that arise, at least in part, from these external factors range from malignancies (squamous cell esophageal cancer, Barrett's esophagus and associated esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer), idiopathic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases, and post-infectious syndromes including post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome, post-infectious dyspepsia and other functional GI disorders. Of particular interest, given their increase in prevalence in much of the world, are immune-mediated conditions in which food antigens are the driving force behind disease development. These entities include celiac disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and food allergies. Celiac disease is a prime example of a condition mediated by dietary factors whose pathogenesis has only recently been determined, providing opportunities for developing treatment options beyond the gluten-free diet. While a genetic basis for this disease clearly exists, it is believed that environmental factors such as an increase in gluten in the human diet account for its rising prevalence, now roughly 1% of genetically susceptible populations in all continents. Proposed therapeutic strategies span from preventing disease by modulating the time of gluten introduction in infants, to reducing exposure to gluten by developing strains of wheat with lower levels of gluten, degrading ingested gluten peptides within the intestinal lumen via endopeptidases or modulating uptake of these peptides across intestinal tight junctions. Other novel treatments in development focus on interfering with the immune events that lead to disease once gluten accesses the lamina propria including altering the immune milieu from a Th1-predominant response via hookworm infection, inhibiting tissue transglutaminase, and blocking antigen presentation and/or T-cell responses to gluten peptides. While new treatment options for celiac disease reflect the complex interaction of diet, genetic factors and the host immune response, the implications for treatment of many conditions of the large and small intestine that arise from environmental and lifestyle are as basic as ensuring adequate nutrition, regular exercise and cessation of tobacco use. Much more needs to be learned about the microbiome, dietary and other factors and their interaction with the human host in order to develop potential new treatment strategies for diseases that result from the environment and lifestyle.},

A careful history and physical examination may reveal clues that suggest a coexisting or alternative diagnosis, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or celiac disease (CD). Testing for bacterial overgrowth has limitations, but emerging data suggest that antibiotics may be of some benefit in patients with IBS with diarrhea and bloating. CD seems to have a higher prevalence in patients with IBS. Some patients with IBS may have symptomatic improvement on gluten-restricted diets, without histologic or serologic evidence of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and stool irregularity are common symptoms in primary care and gastroenterology. A routine diagnostic evaluation fails to reveal any underlying somatic condition in about half of the affected patients, who are therefore said to have a functional bowel disorder. Physicians are often unsure how extensive the work-up must be to exclude a somatic cause. METHODS: This review is based on a selective review of the literature, including published guidelines from Germany and abroad. RESULTS: Functional bowel disorders are diagnosed on the basis of a typical constellation of symptoms and the absence of pathological findings that would adequately explain them (exclusive criteria). The basic diagnostic assessment, consisting of a physical examination, basic laboratory tests, abdominal ultrasonography, and (in women) a gynecological examination, is supplemented by further testing that depends on the patient's symptoms. Colonoscopy is obligatory to rule out underlying pathological abnormalities. By communicating the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome to the patient, the physician shows that the patient's symptoms and concerns have been taken seriously. The mainstays of treatment are patient education on the benign course of the disease and the encouragement of a salubrious lifestyle. Further treatment options include dietary measures, time-limited symptomatic treatment with drugs, and psychotherapy. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of a functional bowel disorder is based on a thorough history (positive criteria) and a small battery of diagnostic tests to exclude somatic disease. Both the diagnostic assessment and the treatment should be carried out in accordance with published guidelines.},

   abstract = {Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal discomfort/pain, and heartburn are ubiquitous and as such are often the focus of nursing interventions. The etiologies of these symptoms include GI pathology (e.g., cancer, inflammation), dietary factors (e.g., lactose intolerance), infection, stress, autonomic nervous system dysregulation, medications, as well as a host of diseases outside the GI tract. This review focuses on a common condition (irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]) that is linked with both bowel pattern and abdominal discomfort/pain symptoms. Family and twin studies give evidence for a role of genetic factors in IBS. Whether genes are directly associated with IBS or influence disease risk indirectly by modulating the response to environmental factors remains unknown at this time. Given the multifactorial nature of IBS, it is unlikely that a single genetic factor is responsible for IBS. In addition, gene-gene (epistatic) interactions are also likely to play a role. Four genes coding for proteins involved in neurotransmission (i.e., the serotonin reuptake transporter [SERT], tryptophan hydroxylase [TPH], alpha2-adrenergic receptor [alpha2-ADR], catechol-o-methyl transferase [COMT]) and their potential relevance to GI symptoms and IBS will be reviewed. Further research using genome-wide association approaches with samples well characterized by ethnicity and standardized symptom subgrouping is needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is symptom-based. Although considered a functional disease, accumulating evidence supports a low-grade gut inflammation as an element of its pathophysiology. Thus, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of micro inflammation, may be elevated in IBS. Our aim was to assess whether hs-CRP is higher in IBS patients compared to healthy controls (HC) and does it differ among the IBS clinical subgroups and correlate with disease severity. METHODS: A diagnostic case control study was conducted in two gastroenterology departments. Eighty-eight IBS patients who were recruited prospectively answered the Rome III diagnostic questionnaire. They all completed the Functional Bowel Disorder Severity Index (FBDSI), dietary, and general health questionnaires. All patients underwent blood sampling for hs-CRP levels. Each IBS patient was matched to four HC by age, gender, and BMI. Blood samples were obtained from the HC at a periodic health survey. KEY RESULTS: The mean hs-CRP level in the IBS group was significantly higher than in HC (1.17+/-1.26mg L(-1) vs 0.72+/-0.91mg L(-1) respectively, P=0.001). Hs-CRP levels were highest in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS and in patients with greater disease severity. A cut-off value of 1.08mg L(-1) had a sensitivity of 60.2% and a specificity of 68% for differentiating IBS from HC. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Hs-CRP levels are higher in IBS patients than HC, but still in the normal laboratory range. This may reflect the low-grade gut inflammation believed to occur in IBS and support its existence.},

   abstract = {Tea flavonoids belong to the large group of polyphenols and display antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic activities. These phytochemicals are xenobiotics and are synthesized by tea plants such as Camellia sinensis and Camomilla recucita. These botanicals exhibit in vivo activities similar to that of biologicals which are widely used for chronic inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, chronic inflammatory bowel disease). Epigallocathechin gallate and apigenin from these plants inhibit cytokines, chemokines and activated immune cells in vivo and in vitro. Clinical disorders with induced inflammatory pathways could benefit from flavonoid treatment. Dietary supplementation with specific tea-flavonoids could be used for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome. Suppression of cytokine production could ultimately lead to inhibition of carcinogenesis. This mechanism could explain why flavonoids are effective in the prevention of intestinal neoplasia. This innovative new form of therapy should be tested in controlled, randomized clinical studies.},

   abstract = {European bison, the largest mammal in Europe, after being exterminated in the wild and then restored during the 20th century is still listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species) as a species vulnerable to extinction. However, the increasing number of European bison, through creation of new and expansion of existing populations strongly increases the risk of human-bison conflict in the near future. We analyzed the depredation of farm crops by bison and the factors influencing the level of damage in the vicinity of two forest areas inhabited by bison in northeastern Poland. Between 2000 and 2010, the total cost of compensation was <euro> 196,200. The level of damage and amount of compensation was increasing from year to year in both forests and correlated with the number of bison. The majority of damage (57 % of cases) was recorded in winter (December-March). Snow depth and temperature did not influence the frequency of damage. The incidences of damage increased with decreasing distance from the woodland patches, therefore, 69 % of cases in Bialowieza Forest, and 80 % in Knyszyn Forest were recorded closer than 0.5 km from nearest woodland patch. The majority of the crops damaged by bison were cereals (61 %) but also hay (20 %) and rape (13 %). When compared to the availability of crops, bison strongly selected rape and rye in both regions. This study is the first addressing the increasing problem of human-bison conflict in re-introduced populations and analyzing long-term data on crop depredation. Such situations probably occur in the majority of growing and expanding bison populations, however, it has not yet to be monitored and is rather neglected in post-Soviet countries.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of a challenge with monosodium glutamate (MSG) as compared to placebo on the symptoms of fibromyalgia (FM), in participants who initially experienced >30% remission of symptoms on an excitotoxin elimination diet. METHODS: Fifty-seven FM patients who also had irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were placed on a 4-week diet that excluded dietary additive excitotoxins including MSG and aspartame. Thirty-seven people completed the diet and 84% of those reported that >30% of their symptoms resolved, thus making them eligible to proceed to challenges. Subjects who improved on the diet were then randomised to a 2-week double-blind placebo-controlled crossover challenge with MSG or placebo for 3 consecutive days each week. The primary outcome measure was total symptom score. Secondary outcome measures included visual analogue pain scales (VAS for FM and IBS), an IBS Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBS QOL) and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised (FIQR). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyse crossover challenge results. RESULTS: The MSG challenge, as compared to placebo, resulted in a significant return of symptoms (total symptom score, p<0.02); a worsening of fibromyalgia severity as determined by the FIQR (p<0.03); decreased quality of life in regards to IBS symptoms (IBS QOL, p<0.05); and a non-significant trend toward worsening FM pain based on visual analogue scale (VAS, p<0.07). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that dietary glutamate may be contributing to FM symptoms in some patients. Future research on the role of dietary excitotoxins in FM is warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A lack of reliable treatments for abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders prompts interest in new therapies. AIM: To evaluate systematically the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) for treating abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders in children. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, trial registries and proceedings of major meetings were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating LGG supplementation in children with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders based on the Rome II or Rome III criteria. Risk of bias was assessed for generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding and follow-up. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, LGG supplementation was associated with a significantly higher rate of treatment responders (defined as no pain or a decrease in pain intensity) in the overall population with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (three RCTs, n = 290; risk ratio, RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.08-1.59, number needed to treat, NNT 7, 95% CI 4-22) and in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subgroup (three RCTs, n = 167; RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.27-2.27, NNT 4, 95% CI 3-8). However, no difference was found in the rate of treatment responders between children with functional abdominal pain or functional dyspepsia who received placebo or LGG. The intensity of pain was significantly reduced in the overall study population and in the IBS subgroup. The frequency of pain was significantly reduced in the IBS subgroup only. CONCLUSION: The use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG moderately increases treatment success in children with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders, particularly among children with IBS.},

Few studies have explored the efficacy of education on compliance with recommendations such as increasing fiber, vegetable, and fruit intake in adults with irritable bowel syndrome. This study examined the effect of a multicomponent self-management intervention that included strategies to enhance fiber, vegetable, and fruit intake. Participants with medically diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome were randomized to usual care or individualized comprehensive self-management, delivered either in-person or by telephone. Since previously published analyses show the two delivery modes to be equally effective, the two intervention groups were combined. Of the 188 individuals randomized, 173 participants (113 in the self-management group and 60 in the usual care group; 23 men, 150 women) provided data on at least one of the three follow-up occasions (3, 6, and 12 months postrandomization). Fiber, vegetable, and fruit intakes were measured using the Food Frequency Questionnaire. Participants in the intervention group demonstrated increases (p < .05) in fiber and fruit intake and a trend in vegetable intake at 6 and 12 months postintervention. Improvement in dietary fiber intake following a self-management intervention for IBS continues to 1 year.},

Possible causes of secondary chronic constipation include medication use, as well as medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism or irritable bowel syndrome. Frail older patients may present with nonspecific symptoms of constipation, such as delirium, anorexia, and functional decline. The evaluation of constipation includes a history and physical examination to rule out alarm signs and symptoms. These include evidence of bleeding, unintended weight loss, iron deficiency anemia, acute onset constipation in older patients, and rectal prolapse.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is prevalent in general population. This study investigates the prevalence of IBS in medical college students in Korea as well as the influence of dietary habits and nutritional intake on IBS. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study of 319 students (239 males and 80 females, age 22.3 +/- 2.5 years) from the 6 grade levels of the Medical College in Korea. All students filled out a self-reported questionnaire for ROME III criteria. They also completed a questionnaire to validate dietary habits and food frequency in Korean. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of IBS was 29.2% without correlation to age, body mass index and grade level in Medical School. However, the prevalence was significantly higher in females than males (33/80 vs 60/239, P = 0.007). There were no significant differences between the IBS-group and the non-IBS group in aspect of nutrition. Not only the diet habits, but also the daily nutritional intake, and even the breakdown into the 12 micronutrients, yielded no significant differences between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-nine percent of the medical college students have IBS with a greater prevalence in females. The dietary habits and nutritional intake of the students might not be associated with IBS.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common health issue that is characterized by abdominal pain, abnormal bowel movements, and altered visceral perception. The complexity and variability in symptoms pose serious challenges in treating IBS. Current therapy for IBS is primarily focused on reducing the abdominal pain, thereby improving the quality of life to a significant extent. Although the use of fiber rich diet is widely recommended in treating IBS, some studies have questioned its use. Intra-colonic butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, is primarily produced by the fermentation of dietary fibers in the colon. In the existing literature there are conflicting reports about the function of butyrate. In rats it is known to induce visceral hypersensitivity without altered pathology, whereas in humans it has been reported to reduce visceral pain. Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for this contrasting effect of butyrate is important before recommending fiber rich diet to IBS patients.},

If these treatments are not satisfactory, as a next step, they should evaluate the patient's stressors, coping styles, and comorbid psychiatric disorders, especially anxiety disorders and depression, and prescribe psychotropic drugs such as antidepressants and anxiolytics. If these treatments are unsatisfactory, as a third step, physicians should refer their patients to psychosomatic medicine specialists to inquire about psychotherapy, hypnosis, fasting therapy, or relaxation training.},

Data were collected in 2009 from 14 Korean women in their 20s and 30s through in-depth interviews using grounded theory. The constant comparative method was adopted for data analysis. The core category identified in the study was the "process of controlling irritable bowel syndrome symptoms." Strategies showed a temporal change progressing through stages of helplessness, searching, realization, struggling, and controlling. Early in symptom management, subjects tended to rely on medication or did not have a strategy. After a trial and error process, subjects did not use medication and natural symptom management that incorporated regular living habits, dietary control, and stress management. The introduction of strategic nursing interventions for irritable bowel syndrome based on the temporal stage of health management is recommended.},

   abstract = {Stress, which is defined as an acute threat to homeostasis, shows both short- and long-term effects on the functions of the gastrointestinal tract. Exposure to stress results in alterations of the brain-gut interactions ("brain-gut axis") ultimately leading to the development of a broad array of gastrointestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal diseases, food antigen-related adverse responses, peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The major effects of stress on gut physiology include: 1) alterations in gastrointestinal motility; 2) increase in visceral perception; 3) changes in gastrointestinal secretion; 4) increase in intestinal permeability; 5) negative effects on regenerative capacity of gastrointestinal mucosa and mucosal blood flow; and 6) negative effects on intestinal microbiota. Mast cells (MC) are important effectors of brain-gut axis that translate the stress signals into the release of a wide range of neurotransmitters and proinflammatory cytokines, which may profoundly affect the gastrointestinal physiology. IBS represents the most important gastrointestinal disorder in humans, and is characterized by chronic or recurrent pain associated with altered bowel motility. The diagnostic testing for IBS patients include routine blood tests, stool tests, celiac disease serology, abdominal sonography, breath testing to rule out carbohydrate (lactose, fructose, etc.) intolerance and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Colonoscopy is recommended if alarming symptoms are present or to obtain colonic biopsies especially in patients with diarrhoea predominant IBS. The management of IBS is based on a multifactorial approach and includes pharmacotherapy targeted against the predominant symptom, behavioural and psychological treatment, dietary alterations, education, reassurance and effective patient-physician relationship. When evaluating for the stress-induced condition in the upper GI tract, the diagnostic testing includes mainly blood tests and gastroscopy to rule out GERD and peptic ulcer disease. The therapy for these conditions is mainly based on the inhibition of gastric acid by proton pump inhibitors and eradication of Helicobacter pylori-infection. Additionally, melatonin an important mediator of brain gut axis has been shown to exhibit important protective effects against stress-induced lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. Finally, probiotics may profoundly affect the brain-gut interactions ("microbiome-gut-brain axis") and attenuate the development of stress-induced disorders in both the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Further studies on the brain-gut axis are needed to open new therapeutic avenues in the future.},

   abstract = {Traditional symptom-based therapies of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are directed at the relief of individual IBS symptoms, but they are often of limited efficacy in addressing the entire symptom complex. Combinations of drugs to target bothersome symptoms are suggested as the first-line pharmacologic treatment. Increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms of IBS has resulted in the development of several new therapeutic approaches. Thirteen consensus statements for the treatment of IBS were developed using the modified Delphi approach. Exclusion diets have modest efficacy in improving symptoms in some IBS patients. Symptom-based therapies with dietary fiber, bulking agents, laxatives, antispasmodics and laxatives are effective in the improvement of some individual symptoms, e.g. dietary fiber and bulking agents for constipation, laxatives for constipation, antispasmodics for abdominal pain and discomfort, antidiarrheals for diarrhea. 5HT3 receptor antagonists and 5HT((4)) receptor agonists are effective in the relief of global IBS symptoms and individual symptoms such as abdominal pain and abnormal bowel habits. A short term course of nonabsorbable antibiotics may improve global IBS symptoms, particularly in patients with diarrhea- predominant IBS. Some probiotics appear to have the potential benefit in improving global IBS symptoms. Selective C-2 chloride channel activator is more effective than placebo at relieving global IBS symptoms in patients with constipation-predominant IBS. Both tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are equally effective in relieving global IBS symptoms, and have some benefits in treating abdominal pain. Certain types of psychologic therapy may be effective in improving global symptoms in some IBS patients. Further studies are strongly needed to develop better treatment strategies for Korean patients with IBS.},

It has been thought that fructose malabsorption may cause the gastrointestinal symptoms seen in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. However, fructose malabsorption is still poorly understood, and clinicians are still uncertain of its role. This review attempts to clarify the relation between fructose malabsorption and symptoms in normal individuals and patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The main problem lies in the diagnosis. First, there is no definite cut off value for the breath tests. Second, we are unsure of the normal absorptive capacity of fructose in normal individuals. Normal individuals will have a degree of fructose malabsorption with or without symptoms depending on the dose of fructose used. From earlier studies, 25 g of fructose seems to be the cut-off dose to investigate fructose malabsorption, with a positive breath test at this dose suggesting abnormally low capacity to absorb fructose. This low level may be difficult to exclude from the daily diet, resulting in symptoms of fructose malabsorption.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome is a common, oftentimes disabling, gastrointestinal disorder whose full range of symptoms has no satisfactory medical or dietary treatment. One of the few empirically validated treatments includes a specific psychological therapy called cognitive behavior therapy which, if available, is typically administered over several months by trained practitioners in tertiary care settings. There is an urgent need to develop more efficient versions of CBT that require minimal professional assistance but retain the efficacy profile of clinic based CBT. The Irritable Bowel Syndrome Outcome Study (IBSOS) is a multicenter, placebo-controlled randomized trial to evaluate whether a self-administered version of CBT is, at least as efficacious as standard CBT and more efficacious than an attention control in reducing core GI symptoms of IBS and its burden (e.g. distress, quality of life impairment, etc.) in moderately to severely affected IBS patients. Additional goals are to assess, at quarterly intervals, the durability of treatment response over a 12 month period; to identify clinically useful patient characteristics associated with outcome as a way of gaining an understanding of subgroups of participants for whom CBT is most beneficial; to identify theory-based change mechanisms (active ingredients) that explain how and why CBT works; and evaluate the economic costs and benefits of CBT. Between August 2010 when IBSOS began recruiting subjects and February 2012, the IBSOS randomized 171 of 480 patients. Findings have the potential to improve the health of IBS patients, reduce its social and economic costs, conserve scarce health care resources, and inform evidence-based practice guidelines.},

   abstract = {Concern exists that increasing fructose consumption, particularly in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, is resulting in increasing rates of fructose intolerance and aggravation of clinical symptoms in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome. Most clinical trials designed to test this hypothesis have used pure fructose, a form not commonly found in the food supply, often in quantities and concentrations that exceed typical fructose intake levels. In addition, the amount of fructose provided in tests for malabsorption, which is thought to be a key cause of intolerance, often exceeds the normal physiological absorption capacity for this sugar. To help health professionals accurately identify and treat this condition, this article reviews clinical data related to understanding fructose malabsorption and intolerance (i.e., malabsorption that manifests with symptoms) relative to usual fructose and other carbohydrate intake. Because simultaneous consumption of glucose attenuates fructose malabsorption, information on the fructose and glucose content of foods, beverages, and ingredients representing a variety of food categories is provided.},

In this cross-sectional study, 17 human subjects with IBS, as defined according to the Rome II criteria, were recruited. IBS symptoms were recorded on diary cards every evening for 7 days, and an IBS sum score was calculated (range, 0-15). Intake of food was assessed from a food diary kept by the subjects in the same period. Associations between IBS sum score and dietary intake were explored. The daily IBS sum score was 6.43 (range, 3.86- 9.09). Intake of vitamin B(6) was the only component of the diet that was significantly associated with the IBS sum score. The median daily intake of vitamin B(6) was 0.9 mg/day (range, 0.6-1.5), the recommended daily intake for men and women is 1.6 mg/day or more and 1.2 mg/day or more, respectively. A high symptom score was associated with low vitamin B(6) intake (adjusted R(2) = 0.583; beta = -4.431; 95% confidence interval, -6.386 to -2.476; P = 0.0002). A significant inverse association between intake of vitamin B(6) and severity of IBS symptoms might have clinical implications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often relate symptoms to the intake of certain foods. This study assesses differences in diet in subjects with and without IBS. METHODS: The cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted in Norway in 2001. Out of 11078 invited subjects, 4621 completed a survey about abdominal complaints and intake of common food items. IBS and IBS subgroups were classified according to Rome II criteria. RESULTS: IBS was diagnosed in 388 subjects (8.4%) and, of these, 26.5% had constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS), 44.8% alternating IBS (A-IBS), and 28.6% diarrhoea-predominant IBS (D-IBS). Low intake of dairy products (portions/day) (Odds Ratio 0.85 [CI 0.78 to 0.93], p = 0.001) and high intake of water (100 ml/day) (1.08 [1.02 to 1.15], p = 0.002), tea (1.05 [1.01 to 1.10], p = 0.019) and carbonated beverages (1.07 [1.01 to 1.14], p = 0.023) were associated with IBS. A lower intake of dairy products and a higher intake of alcohol and carbonated beverages were associated with D-IBS and a higher intake of water and tea was associated with A-IBS. In subjects with IBS the severity of symptoms was associated with a higher intake of vegetables and potatoes in subjects with C-IBS, with a higher intake of vegetables in subjects with A-IBS, and with a higher intake of fruits and berries, carbonated beverages and alcohol in subjects with D-IBS. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the diet differed in subjects with and without IBS and between IBS subgroups and was associated with the severity of symptoms.},

IgE-mediated food allergy is uncommon in IBS, but the role of IgG-mediated food hypersensitivity remains inconclusive. The primary aim of this study was to compare food- and yeast-specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies in subjects with and without IBS. METHODS: This was a case control study in the general population for which subjects completed questionnaires about abdominal complaints and their intake of common food items. Blood samples were collected, and food- and yeast-specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies were measured. Antibodies were measured in mg/L. RESULTS: We included 269 subjects with IBS and 277 control subjects. After correction for subject characteristics and diet, there were no significant differences with regard to food- and yeast-specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies between subjects with IBS and controls. Lower values of IgG antibodies against egg (OR 0.99 (0.98 to 1.00), p = 0.002) and beef (OR 0.75 (0.60 to 0.94), p = 0.012) and higher values of IgG antibodies against chicken (OR 1.14 (1.03 to 1.27), p = 0.009) were associated with more severe symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that IgG-and IgG4-mediated food and yeast hypersensitivity in IBS is unlikely. IgG antibodies against food and yeast may reflect the diet.},

Therefore these diseases should be considered primarily in patients with digestive complaints. For diagnosis an H(2)-breath test is used.In 1,935 patients (526 m, 1,409 f) a fructose intolerance test and in 1,739 patients (518 m,1,221 f) a lactose intolerance test was done.FIT is found more frequently than LIT (57 versus 52 % in adults (p < 0,02) and in children 90 versus 62 % (p < 0,001)) and is in polyintolerances most frequently correlated to histamine intolerance (HIT). Headache (ca. 10 %), fatigue (ca. 5 %) and dizziness (ca. 3 %) may occur after the test, irrespective whether the test was positive or negative.In more than 2/3 of patients a diet reduced in fructose or lactose may lead to improvement or remission of these metabolic disorders. IBS, which is often correlated with FIT (183/221 patients = 83 %), can be improved by relevant but also not relevant diets indicating that irritable bowel disease seems to be caused primarily by psychological disorders.},

   abstract = {Constipation is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder that affects patients of all ages. In 2007, a consensus group of 10 Canadian gastroenterologists developed a set of recommendations pertaining to the management of chronic constipation and constipation dominant irritable bowel syndrome. Since then, tegaserod has been withdrawn from the Canadian market. A new, highly selective serotonin receptor subtype 4 agonist, prucalopride, has been examined in several large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy and safety in the management of patients with chronic constipation. Additional studies evaluating the use of stimulant laxatives, polyethylene glycol and probiotics in the management of chronic constipation have also been published. The present review summarizes the previous recommendations and new evidence supporting different treatment modalities - namely, diet and lifestyle, bulking agents, stool softeners, osmotic and stimulant laxatives, prucalopride and probiotics in the management of chronic constipation. A brief summary of lubiprostone and linaclotide is also presented. The quality of evidence is presented by adopting the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. Finally, a management pyramid for patients with chronic constipation is proposed based on the quality of evidence, impact of each modality on constipation and on general health, and their availabilities in Canada.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Our research group has developed an internet-delivered cognitive behavioral treatment (ICBT) for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We compared ICBT with internet-delivered stress management (ISM) for IBS to assess whether the effects of ICBT are specific. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial, including 195 self-referred participants diagnosed with IBS. The treatment interventions lasted for 10 weeks and included an online therapist contact. The ICBT emphasized acceptance of symptoms through exposure to IBS symptoms and related negative feelings. The ICBT also included mindfulness training. The ISM emphasized symptom control through relaxation techniques, dietary adjustments, and problem-solving skills. Severity of IBS symptoms was measured with the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale-IBS version (GSRS-IBS). Credibility of the treatments and expectancy of improvement were assessed with the treatment credibility scale. The participants' perceived therapeutic alliance with their online therapist was measured with the working alliance inventory. RESULTS: At post-treatment and 6-month follow-up, 192 (99%) and 169 (87%) participants returned data, respectively. At post-treatment and 6-month follow-up, we found significant differences on the GSRS-IBS, favoring ICBT. The difference on GSRS-IBS scores was 4.8 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-8.4) at post-treatment and 5.9 (95% CI: 1.9-9.9) at 6-month follow-up. There were no significant differences on the treatment credibility scale or the working alliance inventory between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Internet-delivered CBT has specific effects that cannot be attributed only to treatment credibility, expectancy of improvement, therapeutic alliance, or attention. Furthermore, a treatment based on exposure exercises specifically tailored for IBS may be a better treatment option than general stress and symptom management for IBS patients. ICBT is a promising treatment modality for IBS as it can be offered to IBS patients in much larger scale than conventional psychological treatments.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Visceral hypersensitivity is frequently observed in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Previous studies have shown that administration of a meal can aggravate symptoms or increase visceroperception in IBS patients. We investigated whether meal ingestion could increase the sensitivity of the barostat procedure for the detection of visceral hypersensitivity in IBS patients. METHODS: Seventy-one IBS patients and 30 healthy controls (HC) were included in the study. All subjects underwent a barostat procedure under fasted and postprandial conditions to measure visceroperception. Urge, discomfort, and pain were scored on a visual analog scale. Furthermore, percentages of hypersensitive IBS patients and HC were calculated and dynamic rectal compliance was assessed. KEY RESULTS: In IBS patients, urge, discomfort, and pain scores were significantly increased postprandially vs the fasted state. The HC showed increased scores for urge and pain only. Rectal dynamic compliance remained unaltered in both groups. Postprandial hypersensitivity percentages did not significantly differ vs the fasted state in IBS patients, nor in HC. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Postprandial barostat measurement enhances visceroperception in IBS but has no added value to detect visceral hypersensitivity in individual IBS patients.},

   abstract = {Functional bowel disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are common disorders that have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. These disorders present major challenges to healthcare providers, as few effective medical therapies are currently available. Recently, there has been increasing interest in dietary therapies for IBS, particularly a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). Since ingestion of FODMAPs increases the delivery of readily fermentable substrates and water to the distal small intestine and colon-which results in luminal distention and gas-the reduction of FODMAPs in a patient's diet may improve functional gastrointestinal symptoms. This paper will review the pathophysiology of IBS and the role of FODMAPs for the treatment of this condition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The main mechanism underlying irritable bowel syndrome is currently believed to be a dysfunction of the brain-gut axis. Autonomic nervous system dysfunction can contribute to development of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms by disturbing visceral sensations. MATERIAL/METHODS: Thirty patients with a diagnosis of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and 30 healthy volunteers were included in the study. Resting and functional autonomic nervous system tests and percutaneous electrogastrography were performed. Plasma adrenalin, noradrenalin, insulin, ghrelin and cholecystokinin activity was analyzed. RESULTS: Increased sympathetic activation with disturbed parasympathetic function was demonstrated. Patients had substantially higher plasma catecholamine concentration, which confirms sympathetic overbalance. Hyperinsulinemia may explain sympathetic predominance followed by gastric and intestinal motility deceleration. Abnormal, reduced ghrelin and cholecystokinin titre may disturb brain-gut axis functioning and may be responsible for gastric motility deceleration. In electrogastrography, distinctly lower values of fasting normogastria percentage and dominant power were observed. Patients had substantially lower slow wave coupling percentage both in fasting and postprandial periods, which negatively correlated with plasma catecholamines level. Gastric myoelectrical activity disturbances may result from lack of sympatho-parasympathetic equilibrium. CONCLUSIONS: Central sympathetic influence within the brain-gut axis is most probably responsible for myoelectrical activity disturbances in irritable bowel syndrome patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Increased intestinal permeability of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients has been recently associated with a decreased level of glutamine synthetase. Neonatal maternal deprivation (NMD) is considered as an IBS-like model. The aim of our study was to investigate whether early nutritional intervention with glutamine may attenuate the deleterious impact of early life stress on gut barrier function in NMD. METHODS: 124 rat pups were separated from their dam 3 h daily during postnatal days 2-14, or left undisturbed (NS). Separated rats received by gavage either with alanyl-glutamine (GLN), an isonitrogenous amino acid mix (AA, control) or an equal amount of drinking water (H(2)O). Production of cytokines was measured by multiplex, expression of COX-2, PPARgamma, tight junction proteins and TLR4 by western blot. Intestinal permeability was studied by Lactulose/Mannitol test. RESULTS: Treatment of pups with GLN or AA abolished the decrease in body weight observed in NMD. Treatment with GLN decreased in the colon (i) TLR4 expression at D20, (ii) IL-2 and -10 productions at D60 (iii) protein expression of occludin at D20 compared to AA. GLN also decreased colon expression of COX2 and PPARgamma at D60 compared to NS. Colon production of IFNgamma is significantly reduced by GLN compared to H(2)O. No significant change in intestinal permeability was observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that an early nutritional intervention with alanyl-glutamine specifically abolished the up-regulation of TLR4 expression in NMD. Glutamine may be evaluated as a potential treatment for IBS patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic debilitating functional gastrointestinal disorder. Diet and lifestyle changes are important management strategies. The aim of these guidelines is to systematically review key aspects of the dietary management of IBS, with the aim of providing evidence-based guidelines for use by registered dietitians. METHODS: Questions relating to diet and IBS symptom management were developed by a guideline development group. These included the role of milk and lactose, nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP), fermentable carbohydrates in abdominal bloating, probiotics and empirical or elimination diets. A comprehensive literature search was conducted and relevant studies from January 1985 to November 2009 were identified using the electronic database search engines: Cinahl, Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science. Evidence statements, recommendations, good practice points and research recommendations were developed. RESULTS: Thirty studies were critically appraised. A dietetic care pathway was produced following a logical sequence of treatment and formed the basis of these guidelines. Three lines of dietary management were identified. first line: Clinical and dietary assessment, healthy eating and lifestyle management with some general advice on lactose and NSP. Second line: Advanced dietary interventions to improve symptoms based on NSP, fermentable carbohydrates and probiotics. Third line: Elimination and empirical diets. Research recommendations were also identified relating to the need for adequately powered and well designed randomised controlled trials. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide evidence-based details of how to achieve the successful dietary management of IBS.},

   abstract = {Patients with IBD who are apparently in remission-as indicated by normal blood tests, endoscopic findings and ultrasonography results-often continue to experience symptoms. Furthermore, despite these negative findings, there is a temptation to increase their anti-inflammatory medication in the hope that this approach would lead to some improvement. However, this strategy often seems to fail and can sometimes lead to adverse events. Consequently, when evidence of continuing inflammatory activity is lacking it might be appropriate to consider the possibility of co-existent IBS in these patients and to treat them for this condition. Dietary manipulation, antispasmodic agents, antidepressants (especially of the tricyclic variety) and even behavioural treatments might result in a worthwhile improvement of symptoms.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate whether composite yogurt with acacia dietary fiber and Bifidobacterium lactis (B. lactis) has additive effects in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: A total of 130 patients were randomly allocated to consume, twice daily for 8 wk, either the composite yogurt or the control product. The composite yogurt contained acacia dietary fiber and high-dose B. lactis together with two classic yogurt starter cultures. Patients were evaluated using the visual analog scale via a structured questionnaire administered at baseline and after treatment. RESULTS: Improvements in bowel habit satisfaction and overall IBS symptoms from baseline were significantly higher in the test group than in the control group (27.16 vs 15.51, P = 0.010, 64.2 +/- 17.0 vs 50.4 +/- 20.5, P < 0.001; respectively). In constipation-predominant IBS, improvement in overall IBS symptoms was significantly higher in the test group than in the control group (72.4 +/- 18.4 vs 50.0 +/- 21.8, P < 0.001). In patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS, improvement in bowel habit satisfaction from baseline was significantly higher in the test group than in the control group (32.90 vs 7.81, P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that composite yogurt enriched with acacia fiber and B. lactis has greater therapeutic effects in patients with IBS than standard yogurt.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Care of patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) commonly includes offering guidance on diet, exercise, and other lifestyle factors, but there is little information available on the actual lifestyles of FGID sufferers. METHODS: An internet questionnaire survey of 15,000 adult members of the general public in Japan who were screened for functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) using the Rome III adult FGID questionnaire was conducted. KEY RESULTS: The prevalence of FD and IBS was 6.5% and 14.0%, respectively, and 3.0% of the subjects met the criteria for both FD and IBS. The prevalence of both FD and IBS was higher in women than in men. The lifestyles of 2,547 subjects who met the Rome III criteria for FD, IBS, or both were compared with the lifestyles of 1,000 control subjects who did not meet the criteria for FD or the criteria for IBS. Compared to the control subjects, a significantly lower percentage of subjects with FD, IBS, or both exercised frequently, and a significantly higher percentage thought that their sleep was insufficient, ate meals irregularly, did not have an appetite, did not like meat, thought that their vegetable consumption was insufficient, felt stress in their daily lives, and regarded themselves as being highly susceptible to stress. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Persons with FGIDs are affected by impairment of sleep, eating habits, diet, exercise and other lifestyle factors, and feel excessive stress. This suggests that offering lifestyle guidance to FGID patients may be useful.},

   abstract = {Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a disorder in which upper abdominal symptoms occur in the absence of organic disease that explains them. Many pathogenic factors have been proposed for FD, including motility abnormalities, visceral hypersensitivity, psychosocial factors, excessive gastric acid secretion, Helicobacter pylori, genetics, environment, diet, lifestyle, and post-infectious FD. Many of those pathogenic factors are also common to irritable bowel syndrome and other functional gastrointestinal disorders, so understanding FD offers a glimpse into the nature of functional gastrointestinal disorders in general. Motility abnormalities and visceral hypersensitivity are thought to be important in the manifestation of FD symptoms, but the other factors are also thought to contribute by interacting and modifying motility and visceral hypersensitivity.},

The authors, after the determination of the masticatory efficiency score (classification of Verkindere) of 100 subjects affected by colopathies and diagnosed in the service of gastroenterology of Cocody University Hospital (Abidjan), attempt to determine the importance of the masticatory deficiency in functional colopathies. Among the toothless subjects with functional colopathies, the restoration of the masticatory efficiency by functional prosthetic rehabilitation constitutes an essential therapeutic act in the reduction of the symptoms of the functional colopathies and the improvement of the comfort of the patients.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder comprising abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, and disordered defecation. The prevalence of IBS is 10-15% in the general population. This study investigated the prevalence of IBS and the relationship between IBS and stress, lifestyle, and dietary habits among nursing and medical school students. METHODS: A blank self-administrated questionnaire was used to survey 2,639 students studying nursing or medicine. This questionnaire asked about IBS symptoms, lifestyle, dietary intake, life events, anxiety, and depression. The questionnaires were collected from 2,365 students (89.6%) and the responses of 1,768 students (74.8%) were analyzed. RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS was 35.5% as a whole, 25.2% in males and 41.5% in females. Significantly higher stress scores (anxiety and depression) and life events were found in the IBS group than in the non-IBS group. Sleep disorders and the time spent sitting were also higher in males with IBS. In the IBS group, females ate less fish, fruit, milk, and green-yellow vegetables, and more processed food products than the non-IBS group (p = 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.032, p = 0.037, p < 0.001). The rates of missed meals and irregular mealtimes were significantly higher in females in the IBS group (p = 0.001, p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IBS was higher among nursing and medical students, and further interventional studies are needed to improve IBS symptoms.},

Furthermore, it studied the effects of guidance on diet management on changes in food intake, quality of life and symptoms. A total of 35 healthy controls, 36 IBS patients and 43 IBS patients who had received guidance on diet management 2 years earlier were included. The controls and patients were asked to complete an FFQ questionnaire, an SF-NDI questionnaire, an IBS-QoL questionnaire and a Birmingham IBS symptom score questionnaire. There were no statistical differences in the intake of calories, carbohydrates, proteins and fat between the controls and IBS patients, with or without guidance on diet management. IBS patients made a conscious choice to avoid certain food items, some of which belong to fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosacharides and polyols (FODMAPs). They had a higher consumption, however, of other food items that are rich in FODMAPs. They also avoided other food sources which are crucial for their health. Two years after receiving guidance on diet management, IBS patients had a different diet profile. They avoided all FODMAPrich food, consumed more food with probiotic supplements and did not avoid food sources that were crucial to their health. In addition, they had improved quality of life and reduced symptoms. Although at first sight the diet of IBS patients did not differ from that of the background population, detailed examination showed avoidance of certain food items. Guidance on the management of diet improved their choice of a healthier diet, improved quality of life and reduced IBS symptoms.},

Investigations carried out during the last decade have contributed to a better understanding of the basic mechanisms of chronic constipation (CC), in particular its relationship to colonic transit and anorectal function. All possible causes affecting the occurance of constipation (methabolic, deficiency of fiber, medicines) should be taken into consideration at the patient's examination and anorectal pathology should be excluded. Functional chronic constipation consists of three subtypes: slow transit constipation, dyssynergetic defecation and IBS with predominance of constipation. Rome criteria are useful guidelines for diagnosis of functional constipation. Treatment should be based on evidence-based diagnosis of CC variants. Treatment of an inert colon should be based on enterokinetic type prucalopride and lubiprostone. The possibilities of biophydbectherapy should obligatory be used in dyssynergetic defecation treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence to support a role for the gastrointestinal microbiota in the etiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Given the evidence of an inflammatory component to IBS, the mucosa-associated microbiota potentially play a key role in its pathogenesis. The objectives were to compare the mucosa-associated microbiota between patients with diarrhea predominant IBS (IBS-D), constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C) and controls using fluorescent in situ hybridization and to correlate specific bacteria groups with individual IBS symptoms. METHODS: Forty-seven patients with IBS (27 IBS-D and 20 IBS-C) and 26 healthy controls were recruited to the study. Snap-frozen rectal biopsies were taken at colonoscopy and bacterial quantification performed by hybridizing frozen sections with bacterial-group specific oligonucleotide probes. KEY RESULTS: Patients with IBS had significantly greater numbers of total mucosa-associated bacteria per mm of rectal epithelium than controls [median 218 (IQR - 209) vs 128 (121) P = 0.007], and this was chiefly comprised of bacteroides IBS [69 (67) vs 14 (41) P = 0.001] and Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides [52 (58) vs 25 (35) P = 0.03]. Analysis of IBS sub-groups demonstrated that bifidobacteria were lower in the IBS-D group than in the IBS-C group and controls [24 (32) vs 54 (88) vs 32 (35) P = 0.011]. Finally, amongst patients with IBS, the maximum number of stools per day negatively correlated with the number of mucosa-associated bifidobacteria (P < 0.001) and lactobacilli (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: The mucosa-associated microbiota in patients with IBS is significantly different from healthy controls with increases in bacteroides and clostridia and a reduction in bifidobacteria in patients with IBS-D.},

   abstract = {As the gluten-free diet (GFD) gains in popularity with the general public, health practitioners are beginning to question its real health benefits. For those patients with celiac disease (CD), the GFD is considered medical nutrition therapy, as well as the only proven treatment that results in improvements in symptomatology and small bowel histology. Those with wheat allergy also benefit from the GFD, although these patients often do not need to restrict rye, barley, and oats from their diet. Gluten sensitivity is a controversial subject, where patients who have neither CD nor wheat allergy have varying degrees of symptomatic improvement on the GFD. Conditions in this category include dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and neurologic diseases such as gluten-sensitive ataxia and autism. It is important for patients and healthcare practitioners to understand the differences between these conditions, even though they may all respond to a GFD. Patients with CD can experience comorbid nutrition deficiencies and are at higher risk for the development of cancers and other autoimmune conditions. Those with wheat allergy and gluten sensitivity are thought not to be at higher risk for these complications. Defining the symptoms and biochemical markers for gluten-sensitive conditions is an important area for future investigations, and high-quality, large-scale randomized trials are needed to prove the true benefits of the GFD in this evolving field.},

These restrictions could put them at risk for disturbed eating. The purpose of this study was to determine if young adults with and without DRCHCs differed with regard to disturbed eating behaviors and related psychographics characteristics (i.e., body image attributes, mental disorders, intrapersonal characteristics and sociocultural environment [i.e., media and family]). Each DRCHC participant (cases=166) was matched to 4 healthy participants (controls=664) based on gender and BMI (+/-0.50 BMI units). Conditional logistic regression analyses indicate cases were twice as likely to have been diagnosed by a healthcare provider with an eating disorder (p=0.08, OR=1.99, CI(90) [1.03-3.83]). Cases were significantly more likely to use Inappropriate Compensatory Behaviors to manage their weight, i.e., excessive exercise (p=0.04, OR=1.41, CI(95) [1.02-1.94]) and misuse medication (p=0.04, OR=1.14, CI(95) [1.00-1.29]) than controls. Depression and anxiety were significantly higher, and health status was significantly poorer in cases compared with controls. DRCHC participants were less likely to report feeling body image pressures from the media, placed a greater value on their health, used social diversion, and recalled a greater emphasis being placed on their mothers' weights and mealtimes being less structured than control participants. Findings indicate that nutrition and other healthcare professionals should incorporate screening DRCHC patients for disturbed eating behaviors and eating disorders in their standards of care.},

   abstract = {Chronic constipation is a very common functional gastrointestinal disorder which can be associated with significant impairments in quality of life for some people with the condition. Its management has, traditionally, been based on dietary and lifestyle changes and the use of a variety of laxative agents. The evidence base for the efficacy of the latter is, in many cases, slim. Not surprisingly, many patients remain dissatisfied with laxatives thus leading to the development of more pharmacological approaches. Among these approaches is the use of prokinetic agents; while prior molecules have been troubled by lack of selectivity and cardiac side effects, the new agent, prucalopride, appears to be highly selective for the serotonin 5-HT4 receptor and is, therefore, a potent stimulator of gut motility. In three large pivotal randomized controlled trials, prucalopride has been effective in relieving the cardinal symptoms of chronic constipation; these effects have been sustained in open-label follow up for as long as 18 months. The safety profile has been encouraging and, especially so, the absence of arrhythmogenic potential. Studies in men, in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and in other motor disorders are eagerly awaited.},

   abstract = {The description of the de novo development of irritable bowel syndrome following an episode of bacterial gastroenteritis (pos-infectious irritable bowel syndrome) illustrated the potential for a luminal factor (a bacterial pathogen) to cause this common gastrointestinal ailment. As a consequence of these and other observations, as well as results of experiments involving animal models, the enteric flora and the immune response that it generates in the host have, somewhat surprisingly, come centre-stage in irritable bowel syndrome research, given their potential to induce the pathophysiological changes that are associated with irritable bowel syndrome. While evidence for immune dysfunction both in the mucosa and systemically continues to accumulate, methodological limitations have hampered a full delineation of the nature of the microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome. The latter is eagerly awaited and may yet provide a firm rationale for the use of certain probiotics and antibiotics in irritable bowel syndrome, whose benefits have now been described with some consistency. Despite its prevalence, there is a striking lack of effective therapeutic options for irritable bowel syndrome. While there is reason for optimism in the management of irritable bowel syndrome with several promising new agents currently undergoing clinical trials, confirmation of the efficacy and safety of these agents in wider patient populations is awaited. A clearer understanding of the physiopathologic mechanisms underlying irritable bowel syndrome, as well as of interrelationships between irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, will likely be required before effective drug therapies can be found.},

METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We included randomized controlled trials in humans that used a specified probiotic in the treatment or prevention of Pouchitis, Infectious diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium difficile Disease, Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea, Traveler's Diarrhea, or Necrotizing Enterocolitis. Random effects models were used to evaluate efficacy as pooled relative risks across the eight diseases as well as across probiotic species, single vs. multiple species, patient ages, dosages, and length of treatment. Probiotics had a positive significant effect across all eight gastrointestinal diseases with a relative risk of 0.58 (95% (CI) 0.51-0.65). Six of the eight diseases: Pouchitis, Infectious diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium difficile Disease, and Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea, showed positive significant effects. Traveler's Diarrhea and Necrotizing Enterocolitis did not show significant effects of probiotcs. Of the 11 species and species mixtures, all showed positive significant effects except for Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bifidobacterium infantis. Across all diseases and probiotic species, positive significant effects of probiotics were observed for all age groups, single vs. multiple species, and treatment lengths. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Probiotics are generally beneficial in treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal diseases. Efficacy was not observed for Traveler's Diarrhea or Necrotizing Enterocolitis or for the probiotic species L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, and B. infantis. When choosing to use probiotics in the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal disease, the type of disease and probiotic species (strain) are the most important factors to take into consideration.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) was traditionally believed to be a chronic enteropathy, almost exclusively affecting people of European origin. Celiac disease is the permanent intolerance to dietary gluten, the major protein component of wheat. The availability of new, simple, very sensitive and specific serological tests has shown that CD is as common in Middle Eastern countries as in Europe, Australia and New Zealand where the major dietary staple is wheat. A high prevalence of CD has been found in Iran, in both the general population and the at-risk groups, i.e. patients with type 1 diabetes or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In developing countries, serological testing in at risk groups is necessary for early identification of celiac patients. Clinical studies show that presentation with non-specific symptoms or a lack of symptoms is as common in the Middle East as in Europe. Wheat is a major component of the Iranian diet and exposure to wheat proteins induces some degree of immune tolerance, leading to milder symptoms that may be mistaken with other GI disorders. The implementation of gluten free diet (GFD) is a major challenge for both patients and clinicians in Iran, especially since commercial gluten-free products are not available in this area.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder. The role of pharmacotherapy for IBS is limited and focused mainly on symptom control. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of bulking agents, antispasmodics and antidepressants for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. SEARCH STRATEGY: Computer assisted structured searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane library, CINAHL and PsychInfo were conducted for the years 1966-2009. An updated search in April 2011 identified 10 studies which will be considered for inclusion in a future update of this review. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials comparing bulking agents, antispasmodics or antidepressants with a placebo treatment in patients with irritable bowel syndrome aged over 12 years were considered for inclusion. Only studies published as full papers were included. Studies were not excluded on the basis of language. The primary outcome had to include improvement of abdominal pain, global assessment or symptom score. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data from the selected studies. Risk Ratios (RR) and Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. A proof of practice analysis was conducted including sub-group analyses for different types of bulking agents, spasmolytic agents or antidepressant medication. This was followed by a proof of principle analysis where only the studies with adequate allocation concealment were included. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 56 studies (3725 patients) were included in this review. These included 12 studies of bulking agents (621 patients), 29 of antispasmodics (2333 patients), and 15 of antidepressants (922 patients). The risk of bias was low for most items. However, selection bias is unclear for many of the included studies because the methods used for randomization and allocation concealment were not described. No beneficial effect for bulking agents over placebo was found for improvement of abdominal pain (4 studies; 186 patients; SMD 0.03; 95% CI -0.34 to 0.40; P = 0.87), global assessment (11 studies; 565 patients; RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.33; P = 0.32) or symptom score (3 studies; 126 patients SMD -0.00; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.43; P = 1.00). Subgroup analyses for insoluble and soluble fibres also showed no statistically significant benefit. Separate analysis of the studies with adequate concealment of allocation did not change these results. There was a beneficial effect for antispasmodics over placebo for improvement of abdominal pain (58% of antispasmodic patients improved compared to 46% of placebo; 13 studies; 1392 patients; RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.55; P < 0.001; NNT = 7), global assessment (57% of antispasmodic patients improved compared to 39% of placebo; 22 studies; 1983 patients; RR 1.49; 95% CI 1.25 to 1.77; P < 0.0001; NNT = 5) and symptom score (37% of antispasmodic patients improved compared to 22% of placebo; 4 studies; 586 patients; RR 1.86; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.76; P < 0.01; NNT = 3). Subgroup analyses for different types of antispasmodics found statistically significant benefits for cimteropium/ dicyclomine, peppermint oil, pinaverium and trimebutine. Separate analysis of the studies with adequate allocation concealment found a significant benefit for improvement of abdominal pain. There was a beneficial effect for antidepressants over placebo for improvement of abdominal pain (54% of antidepressants patients improved compared to 37% of placebo; 8 studies; 517 patients; RR 1.49; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.12; P = 0.03; NNT = 5), global assessment (59% of antidepressants patients improved compared to 39% of placebo; 11 studies; 750 patients; RR 1.57; 95% CI 1.23 to 2.00; P < 0.001; NNT = 4) and symptom score (53% of antidepressants patients improved compared to 26% of placebo; 3 studies; 159 patients; RR 1.99; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.99; P = 0.001; NNT = 4). Subgroup analyses showed a statistically significant benefit for selective serotonin releasing inhibitors (SSRIs) for improvement of global assessment and for tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) for improvement of abdominal pain and symptom score. Separate analysis of studies with adequate allocation concealment found a significant benefit for improvement of symptom score and global assessment. Adverse events were not assessed as an outcome in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that bulking agents are effective for treating IBS. There is evidence that antispasmodics are effective for the treatment of IBS. The individual subgroups which are effective include: cimetropium/dicyclomine, peppermint oil, pinaverium and trimebutine. There is good evidence that antidepressants are effective for the treatment of IBS. The subgroup analyses for SSRIs and TCAs are unequivocal and their effectiveness may depend on the individual patient. Future research should use rigorous methodology and valid outcome measures.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with celiac disease (CD) often report symptoms compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the prevalence of these symptoms in patients with CD and their relation to adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) have not been assessed systematically. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic (through July 2012) to identify cross-sectional surveys or case-control studies reporting prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in adult patients (>/= 16 years old) with established CD. The number of individuals with symptoms meeting criteria for IBS was extracted for each study, according to case or control status and adherence to a GFD. Pooled prevalence and odds ratios (ORs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated. We analyzed data from 7 studies with 3383 participants. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in all patients with CD was 38.0% (95% CI, 27.0%-50.0%). The pooled OR for IBS-type symptoms was higher in patients with CD than in controls (5.60; 95% CI, 3.23-9.70). In patients who were nonadherent with a GFD, the pooled OR for IBS-type symptoms, compared with those who were strictly adherent, was 2.69 (95% CI, 0.75-9.56). There was also a trend toward a higher OR for IBS-type symptoms among patients who did not adhere to the GFD, compared with controls (12.42; 95% CI, 6.84-11.75), compared with that observed for adherent CD patients vs controls (4.28; 95% CI, 1.56-11.75). CONCLUSIONS: IBS-type symptoms occur frequently in patients with CD and are more common than among controls. Adherence to a GFD might be associated with a reduction in symptoms.},

   abstract = {Historically, it has been reported that patients with undetected celiac disease (CD) may present with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) type symptoms. This has led to the recommendation by the American College of Gastroenterology Task force that patients presenting with diarrhea predominant IBS type symptoms should be serologically tested for CD. Concurrently speculative media data suggest that the US general public have increased their uptake of a gluten-free diet (GFD) far in excess of the known prevalence of CD. This may suggest that individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms are deriving benefit from a GFD even if they do not have CD. This has led to the scientific community considering the evidence for an emerging concept of non-celiac wheat sensitivity. There is a significant disparity in our views about what this phenomenon may be. There is also confusion about the nomenclature for this entity and indeed whether patients are suffering due to symptoms related to gluten or perhaps other components of wheat, for example fructans. In this month's edition of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, we see evidence to support the clinical concept of wheat sensitivity or intolerance. Irrespective of the nomenclature Carroccio provides a clinically applicable approach that may be adopted internationally by clinicians. This offers a new option in our armamentarium when seeing patients with IBS type symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Our aim was to measure concentrations of platelet-poor plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine and to assess any relationship with gastrointestinal symptomatology under fasting and fed conditions in alternating-type irritable bowel syndrome during both constipation and diarrhea periods separately. Results of the two periods were compared with each other as well as with the results of the controls. METHODS: Nine patients with alternating diarrhea and constipation symptoms and 9 controls were enrolled. Serial plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine was measured for 1 hour under fasting and for 3 hour after a standard carbohydrate meal. Patients underwent the same measurements during constipation and diarrhea periods separately. Serum 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Symptomatology was assessed throughout the study. RESULTS: Patients exhibited higher concentrations of platelet-poor plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine under fed conditions during diarrhea, especially at postprandial 30 minutes (p<0.05) compared with concentrations during constipation. Increases in postprandial plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations relative to fasting concentrations were also significantly higher during the diarrhea period than during constipation and in controls (p<0.05). Although there was no significant correlation between plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations and symptom scores, patients had worse postprandial symptomatology during diarrhea compared with controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Platelet-poor plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations after meal ingestion differ between constipation and diarrhea periods in alternating-type irritable bowel syndrome. Postprandial symptomatology is also more prominent during diarrhea. These results suggest that differences in plasma levels of serotonin between diarrhea and constipation may underlie the pathogenesis of alternating-type irritable bowel syndrome and could be involved in some aspects of symptomatology.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the relevant publications during the last 12 months supporting that diet can influence gas-related symptoms in the absence of a malabsorption state. RECENT FINDINGS: Gas symptoms during carbohydrate fermentation: a diet incorporating beans is well tolerated by a majority of individuals involved in a program of heart disease biomarkers. By contrast, in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, a diet avoiding fermentable carbohydrates improved gas-related abdominal symptoms. The rate of fermentation determines the production of abdominal symptoms, and many slowly fermentable fibers have a rapid fermentation profile that can generate abdominal symptoms. Modulation of visceral sensitivity: diet can influence gas symptoms by increasing the tolerability of the intestine to gas. Capsaicin decreases visceral hyperalgesia and improved bloating in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Changes in gas-producing bacteria: different strains of Lactobacillus have antimicrobial properties against gas-forming coliforms. New clinical studies show beneficial effects of prebiotics and probiotics on abdominal bloating. SUMMARY: Actual data suggest that diet could improve gas-related abdominal symptoms acting on several mechanisms: gas production, visceral hypersensitivity and modulation of gas-producing enteric bacteria.},

   abstract = {It is increasingly perceived that gut host-microbial interactions are important elements in the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). The most convincing evidence to date is the finding that functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may develop in predisposed individuals following a bout of infectious gastroenteritis. There has been a great deal of interest in the potential clinical and therapeutic implications of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in IBS. However, this theory has generated much debate because the evidence is largely based on breath tests which have not been validated. The introduction of culture-independent molecular techniques provides a major advancement in our understanding of the microbial community in FGID. Results from 16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling approaches demonstrate both quantitative and qualitative changes of mucosal and faecal gut microbiota, particularly in IBS. Investigators are also starting to measure host-microbial interactions in IBS. The current working hypothesis is that abnormal microbiota activate mucosal innate immune responses which increase epithelial permeability, activate nociceptive sensory pathways and dysregulate the enteric nervous system. While we await important insights in this field, the microbiota is already a therapeutic target. Existing controlled trials of dietary manipulation, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and non-absorbable antibiotics are promising, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. In this article, the authors provide a critical review of current hypotheses regarding the pathogenetic involvement of microbiota in FGID and evaluate the results of microbiota-directed interventions. The authors also provide clinical guidance on modulation of gut microbiota in IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The effect of probiotics on IBS symptoms has been mixed, but remains an intriguing treatment option with appeal to the patient. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients fulfilling the Rome II criteria were randomized double-blind to a daily intake of 500 ml of fermented milk containing at least 5 x 10(7) CFU/ml of Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 or an equal volume of acidified milk for 8 weeks. Symptoms were assessed at baseline and weekly using a disease-specific validated symptom rating scale (IBS-SSI). The predefined primary outcome measure was patient reported adequate symptom relief. Adherence to study protocol were assessed by performing stool samples at the of the treatment period. RESULTS: Eight-one patients were screened. Sixty-four patients were randomized; 18 patients did not complete the study due to protocol violations or withdrew due to lack of effect. Fifty-two patients (13 males) completed the study as per protocol; mean age was 51.3 years (range 29-67). The proportion of patients reporting adequate symptom relief increased in both patient groups, but there was not any statistical difference between the groups. IBS-SSI scores did not differ statistically between the groups at the end of the treatment period, but improved during the study period in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: During this 8-week trial gastrointestinal symptoms improved. However, there was no difference between treatment with fermented milk containing probiotics or acidified milk. The effect of probiotics on IBS symptoms remains uncertain and further studies are warranted.},

Questionnaire survey was conducted at a girl's middle and high school. Students from seventh to eleventh grade participated in the examination on Rome II criteria, lifestyle and dietary habits. Worry and stress were measured with the Korean version Penn State Worry Questionnaire-Children and the Korean version Brief Encounter Psychosocial Instrument. Worry score was significantly higher in the IBS group (22.07 +/- 9.38, P < 0.001) than in the normal group (18.65 +/- 8.99) and was higher in high school students than in middle school students (P = 0.02). Stress score also was higher in the IBS group than in the normal group (P < 0.001) and was higher in the high school girls than in the middle school ones (P = 0.04). Of all the lifestyle factors influencing IBS preference for fatty foods, preference for salty foods, drinking alcohol and sleeping for less than six hours a day were found to be significant. Worry and stress seem to be associated with IBS symptoms. The findings of this study draw a clue that less worry and stress will help decrease IBS symptoms.},

   abstract = {Recent data developing from the study of postinfectious IBS has challenged the belief that IBS is a purely psychological disorder. Distinct abnormalities of the gut mucosa have been reported including immune activation and increased release of inflammatory mediators with some overlap with IBD. New studies show that genetic factors which predispose to IBD are also associated with IBS. A common feature is impaired gut barrier function which appears to precede the development of IBD while in IBS it may be the result of either a preceding infection or psychosocial stress. Stress can activate mast cells which are a feature in most but not all IBS series. Anti-inflammatory treatments targeting activated mast cells may benefit IBS patients but currently the evidence is weak and larger trials are needed. Changes in the commensal microbiota have been recently described with a "dysbiosis" in CD characterised by reduced diversity. Inconsistent changes have also been described in IBS but studies controlling for antibiotic use and differences in diet and bowel habit are needed before definitive conclusions can be made.},

Prebiotic fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides stimulate colonic bifidobacteria. However, the effect of restricting fermentable short-chain carbohydrates on the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota has never been examined. This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the effects of fermentable carbohydrate restriction on luminal microbiota, SCFA, and GI symptoms in patients with IBS. Patients with IBS were randomized to the intervention diet or habitual diet for 4 wk. The incidence and severity of symptoms and stool output were recorded for 7 d at baseline and follow-up. A stool sample was collected and analyzed for bacterial groups using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Of 41 patients randomized, 6 were withdrawn. At follow-up, there was lower intake of total short-chain fermentable carbohydrates in the intervention group compared with controls (P = 0.001). The total luminal bacteria at follow-up did not differ between groups; however, there were lower concentrations (P < 0.001) and proportions (P < 0.001) of bifidobacteria in the intervention group compared with controls when adjusted for baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, more patients in the intervention group reported adequate control of symptoms (13/19, 68%) compared with controls (5/22, 23%; P = 0.005). This randomized controlled trial demonstrated a reduction in concentration and proportion of luminal bifidobacteria after 4 wk of fermentable carbohydrate restriction. Although the intervention was effective in managing IBS symptoms, the implications of its effect on the GI microbiota are still to be determined.},

The present study aimed to determine whether a low FODMAP diet is effective for symptom control in patients with IBS and to compare its effects with those of standard dietary advice based on the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines. METHODS: Consecutive patients with IBS who attended a follow-up dietetic outpatient visit for dietary management of their symptoms were included. Questionnaires were completed for patients who received standard (n = 39) or low FODMAP dietary advice (n = 43). Data were recorded on symptom change and comparisons were made between groups. RESULTS: In total, more patients in the low FODMAP group reported satisfaction with their symptom response (76%) compared to the standard group (54%, P = 0.038). Composite symptom score data showed better overall symptom response in the low FODMAP group (86%) compared to the standard group (49%, P < 0.001). Significantly more patients in the low FODMAP group compared to the standard group reported improvements in bloating (low FODMAP 82% versus standard 49%, P = 0.002), abdominal pain (low FODMAP 85% versus standard 61%, P = 0.023) and flatulence (low FODMAP 87% versus standard 50%, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A low FODMAP diet appears to be more effective than standard dietary advice for symptom control in IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The traditional classification of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as a functional disorder has been challenged in recent years by evidence of ongoing low-grade gastrointestinal tract inflammation. Inflammation may alter gastrointestinal motility and thus be central to the pathogenesis of IBS. Many foods and food additives are known to cause allergic contact dermatitis. We hypothesize that allergenic foods and food additives may elicit a similar allergic reaction in the gastrointestinal tract, giving rise to symptoms suggestive of IBS. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether skin patch testing to a panel of foods and food additives may identify food allergens that may be responsible for symptoms of IBS. METHODS: We performed skin patch testing to common allergenic foods and food additives on individuals with a history of or symptoms suggestive of IBS. We used patch test-guided avoidance diets to determine whether avoidance alleviates IBS symptoms. RESULTS: Thirty of the 51 study participants showed at least 1 doubtful or positive patch test result. Fourteen of the participants reported symptomatic improvement, ranging from slight to great, upon avoidance of the foods/food additives to which they reacted. LIMITATIONS: Double-blind study design, inclusion of only patients with active IBS, larger sample size, more balanced gender distribution, testing of more foods/food additives, and longer duration of and more precise quantification of response to dietary avoidance are suggested for future studies. CONCLUSION: Allergic contact enteritis to ingested foods, food additives, or both may contribute to IBS symptoms. Patch testing may be useful in identifying the causative foods.},

   abstract = {Diverticular disease imposes a significant burden on Western and industrialized societies. The traditional pathogenesis model posits that low dietary fiber predisposes to diverticulosis, and fecalith obstruction prompts acute diverticulitis that is managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics or surgery. However, a growing body of knowledge is shifting the paradigm of diverticular disease from an acute surgical illness to a chronic bowel disorder composed of recurrent abdominal symptoms and considerable psychosocial impact. New research implicates a role for low-grade inflammation, sensory-motor nerve damage, and dysbiosis in a clinical picture that mimics irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and even inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Far from being an isolated event, acute diverticulitis may be the catalyst for chronic symptoms including abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and "post-diverticulitis IBS." In addition, studies reveal lower health-related quality of life in patients with chronic diverticular disease vs. controls. Health-care providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for the multifaceted presentations of diverticular disease, and remain aware that it might contribute to long-term emotional distress beyond traditional diverticulitis attacks. These developments are prompting a shift in therapeutic approaches from widespread antimicrobials and supportive care to the use of probiotics, mesalamine, and gut-directed antibiotics. This review addresses the emerging literature regarding epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of chronic, symptomatic diverticular disease, and provides current answers to common clinical questions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatments delivered during a pragmatic effectiveness study of acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and to explore the roles of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnoses and preferences of the acupuncturists in treatment design. METHODS: Patients allocated to an acupuncture arm of a study were offered up to ten sessions of acupuncture over 3 months. Acupuncturists followed a flexible treatment protocol that allowed for treatment individualization, use of additional therapies such as moxa, and provision of lifestyle advice. All treatments were recorded in logbooks and analyzed by content analysis. RESULTS: Seven primary and eight secondary TCM patterns were identified among the 113 patients with IBS, and were combined in various ways to produce unique diagnoses for 84% patients. Liver Qi Stagnation and Damp Heat were the most commonly reported patterns. Of the 126 acupuncture points used, a distinct core and supporting group of points was associated with each primary pattern. Each practitioner also utilized a distinct core and supporting group of points that reflected his/her preferences. Use of additional therapies (e.g., moxa) and provision of lifestyle advice (e.g., diet) were generally consistent with a particular practitioner. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that a patient's TCM diagnosis, the practitioner's preferences, and a patient's individual characteristics beyond his/her diagnosis influence treatment delivery. In particular, TCM diagnoses appear to influence the acupuncture (i.e., point selection) aspect of treatment more than the selection of additional therapies and lifestyle advice. From another perspective, the treatments incorporated pragmatic, individualized, and disease-specific approaches with combinations that produced both treatment commonalities and diversities.},

While the cause of bloating remains unknown old explanations such as a excessive intestinal gas, exaggerated lumbar lordosis and psychiatric problems have been disproved. New suggestions include recent weight gain, weak or inappropriately relaxed abdominal muscles, an inappropriately contracted diaphragm and retained fluid in loops of distal small bowel. No treatment is of unequivocal benefit but a low FODMAPs diet, probiotics and the non-absorbable antibiotic rifaximin offer some hope. Treatment by weight loss, abdominal exercise, prokinetics and girdles need more study.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of Soothing Gan and invigorating Pi (SGIP) acupuncture treatment on the clinical symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). METHODS: With a single-blinded randomized control study adopted, 63 patients who met the inclusion criteria were assigned by a random number table to two groups, 31 in the treatment group and 32 in the drug control group. The treatment group received SGIP acupuncture therapy; while the control group was treated orally with pinaverium bromide. The treatment duration of both groups was 28 days. The clinical efficacy was evaluated and compared by scoring patient's symptom and QOL. RESULTS: A significant difference was found by variance analysis in efficacies between the two groups (P<0.01), shown as the quicker initiation of effect (P<0.05) and the more evident clinical improvement in symptoms along the increase in treatment duration, as well as the more significant elevation of QOL in the acupuncture treatment group (P<0.01). SGIP displayed its superiority especially in improving dysphoria, conflict behavior, dietary restrictions, and social responses. CONCLUSION: SGIP acupuncture treatment could effectively alleviate the degree and frequency of symptoms' attack in IBS-D patients, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, abdominal distension, etc., markedly relieve the tenesmic sensation, with the efficacy better than that of pinaverium bromide, showing a preponderance in improving patient's QOL.},

One hundred sixty-five individuals diagnosed with AS were invited to complete a self-administered postal questionnaire regarding demographic data, diet, medication, and gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to two established disease assessment questionnaires, i.e., the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). No significant correlation between diet and disease activity was found. Overall, 27% of the patients reported aggravating gastrointestinal problems when consuming certain foodstuff(s). The 30% of patients who reported suffering from gastrointestinal pain had significantly greater disease activity and poorer functional status according to their BASDAI and BASFI scores (p < 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively). Patients who reported gastrointestinal pain had a significantly higher consumption of vegetables (p < 0.01) and lower consumption of milk and soured milk (p = 0.04). No significant correlation was found between the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and gastrointestinal symptoms. In multiple regression models, BASDAI and the consumption of vegetables were independent and statistically significant predictors of gastrointestinal pain. To conclude, in a group of Swedish AS patients, no correlation between diet and disease activity could be detected. There were, however, correlations between diet and gastrointestinal pain. Gastrointestinal problems were also found to be prevalent in AS, independent of NSAID usage.},

In a considerable subgroup of these, no underlying cause is identified and this is referred to as functional diarrhea. A consensus definition for functional diarrhea is based on loose stool consistency and chronicity and absence of coexisting irritable bowel syndrome. Underlying pathophysiology includes rapid intestinal transit, which may be worsened by stress or be triggered by a preceding infectious gastroenteritis. Diagnostic work-up aims at exclusion of underlying organic disease. Treatment starts with dietary adjustments, aiming at decreasing nutrients that enhance transit and stool and at identifying precipitating food items.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the intensity of symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) or the consequences of the disease on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This observational investigation assessed the symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, number of stools per day, and stool consistency), impact on HRQOL, and consequence on anal continence in 297 patients with IBS-D before and after 1 month of probiotic treatment with Lacteol (inactivated Lactobacillus LB plus fermented culture medium). METHODS: Functional assessment using a standardized visual analogue scale in order to quantify abdominal pain, bloating, and quality of life before and after 1 month of treatment with 2 capsules/day of Lacteol. The number of symptomatic days per week, number of stools, consistency of stools, secondary fecal incontinence rate, and potential trigger effect of food were quantified. A chi2 test was used to compare qualitative data and the variance of quantitative criteria was analyzed. RESULTS: The pain score decreased from 4.46+/-0.15 on a scale of 0-10 before treatment to 2.8+/-0.14 after treatment (p<0.0001). Bloating decreased from 4.49+/-0.18 to 2.5+/-0.15 on a scale of 0-10 (p<0.0001). The HRQOL score, which is inversely correlated with quality of life, decreased from 5.99+/-0.14 to 3.92+/-0.16 (p<0.0001). In this cohort study, the fecal incontinence rate secondary to diarrhea was clearly higher than that of the general population: 18% versus a prevalence of 9-10%, according to different studies. The mean number of stools per week decreased from 17.59 to 12.83 after treatment (p<0.0001). Before treatment, 54% of patients had watery stools and 46% had smooth stools; at the end of treatment, only 18.5% of patients still had watery stools, and 34% had normal stools. 52% of patients attributed their symptoms to their diet: 34% to vegetables, 29% to fruit, 15% to milk, 15% to fat, 6% to peppers and spices, and 4% to sugar. CONCLUSION: This observational investigation shed new light on patients with IBS-D, the HRQOL of which is altered by a fecal incontinence rate twice as high as that of the general population. Correlation with diet is confirmed by 1 out of 2 patients reporting poor tolerance of fiber and dairy products. Nutritional management should thus be part of these patients' treatment. Inactivated Lactobacillus LB plus fermented culture medium is a probiotic drug that has been used by physicians for a long time to treat patients with diarrhea. Strongly concentrated, it has no side effects and seems to help these patients. Due to a strong placebo effect in patients with this pathology, however, a controlled study is necessary to confirm this result.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Our understanding of the importance of nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to improve. With increasing evidence or cumulative evidence, this article reviews the current data for the role of nutrition in IBD pathogenesis, disease exacerbation and its use in the treatment of IBD in a clinically relevant context. RECENT FINDINGS: Irritable bowel syndrome and obesity prevalence is rising, and is increasingly being recognized in patients with IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition remains highly relevant because of its efficacy and superior side-effect profile, even when considered against new pharmacological treatments, but requires patient motivation. We are now beginning to understand the importance of micronutrients such as iron and vitamin D, which may not only alter the bowel flora but also have an immune-modulatory effect. More recently, a prebiotic and probiotic combination has been used in a randomized trial for the treatment of IBD. SUMMARY: Macronutrient and micronutrient assessment should be an essential part of nutritional assessment of all patients with IBD. Although research is needed to further our understanding of the immune-modulatory effects of nutrients and supplements, better and more effective therapies combining nutrition and drug treatments like immune-suppressants should be explored.},

   abstract = {WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The complexity and diversity of irritable bowel syndrome's (IBS) presentation make treatment difficult. Although there are reviews and guidelines for treating IBS, they focus on the efficacy of medications for IBS symptoms using high-priority endpoints, leaving those of lower priority largely unreported. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive evidence-based review of the efficacy of medications to treat IBS symptoms, reported by IBS subtype, including secondary symptom endpoints that are often underreported. METHODS: A review of PubMed for articles published through December 2009 using the keywords: 'irritable bowel syndrome', 'therapeutics', 'antidiarrhoeals', 'laxatives', 'loperamide', 'dietary fibre', 'psyllium', 'calcium polycarbophil', 'bulking agents', 'lubiprostone', 'antidepressant agents, tricyclics' and its representative entities, 'serotonin reuptake inhibitors' and its representative entities, 'dicyclomine', hyoscyamine', 'peppermint oil', 'parasympatholytics' and its representative entities, 'rifaximin', 'pregabalin', 'gabapentin', 'clonidine', 'octreotide', 'atropine' and 'probiotics' is provided. Placebo-controlled trials were evaluated for the strength of evidence supporting the efficacy of each medication for explicit IBS symptoms. The efficacy of each medication for the symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, stool form, mucus, urgency, feeling of incomplete evacuation, flatulence, frequency, or borborgymi and overall symptoms are reported by IBS subtype. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The literature search identified 58 placebo-controlled trials of the efficacy of medications for treating IBS symptoms, which were critically evaluated and reported. The available studies suggest improvement in various IBS symptoms with loperamide, fibre supplements, lubiprostone, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs), antispasmotics, rifaximin, pregabalin, gabapentin, clonidine, octreotide and probiotic treatments. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This review is the first to compile the available evidence on the efficacy of the various pharmacological treatments for IBS on the basis of IBS subtype and specific symptoms. This evidence is limited and more well-designed studies are required to better inform therapeutic decision-making in the management of this difficult syndrome.},

   abstract = {Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with diarrhea (IBS-D) carrying human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2/8 genotypes benefit from gluten withdrawal. Our objective was to compare gastrointestinal barrier function, mucosal inflammation, and transit in nonceliac IBS-D patients and assess association with HLA-DQ2/8 status. In 45 IBS-D patients who were naive to prior exclusion of dietary gluten, we measured small bowel (SB) and colonic mucosal permeability by cumulative urinary lactulose and mannitol excretion (0-2 h for SB and 8-24 h for colon), inflammation on duodenal and rectosigmoid mucosal biopsies (obtained in 28 of 45 patients), tight junction (TJ) protein mRNA and protein expression in SB and rectosigmoid mucosa, and gastrointestinal and colonic transit by validated scintigraphy. SB mucosal biopsies were stained with hematoxylin-eosin to assess villi and intraepithelial lymphocytes, and immunohistochemistry was used to assess CD3, CD8, tryptase, and zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1); colonic biopsy intraepithelial lymphocytes were quantitated. Associations of HLA-DQ were assessed using Wilcoxon's rank-sum test. Relative to healthy control data, we observed a significant increase in SB permeability (P < 0.001), a borderline increase in colonic permeability (P = 0.10), and a decrease in TJ mRNA expression in rectosigmoid mucosa in IBS-D. In HLA-DQ2/8-positive patients, ZO-1 protein expression in the rectosigmoid mucosa was reduced compared with that in HLA-DQ2/8-negative patients and colonic transit was slower than in HLA-DQ2/8-negative patients. No other associations with HLA genotype were identified. There is abnormal barrier function (increased SB permeability and reduced mRNA expression of TJ proteins) in IBS-D relative to health that may be, in part, related to immunogenotype, given reduced ZO-1 protein expression in rectosigmoid mucosa in HLA-DQ2/8-positive relative to HLA-DQ2/8-negative patients.},

   abstract = {Functional gastrointestinal disorders are the most common gastroenterological problem in our society. Changes in gut function, including pain perception, motility, and intestinal permeability, and low-grade inflammation have been described in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The triggering factors for the described immunity and gut functional changes in patients with IBS are not completely understood. Similarly to post-infective IBS, some patients with IBS symptoms exhibit immunological evidence of gluten sensitivity but have no overt intestinal mucosal injury. They have symptoms that meet the diagnostic criteria for IBS and respond symptomatically to exclusion of gluten from the diet. Thus, gluten sensitivity may be involved in the pathogenesis of a subgroup of IBS patients. Unfortunately, there remain many unanswered questions regarding the mechanistic link between gluten sensitivity and functional gastrointestinal symptoms.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in our ability to identify and characterize the human microbiota have transformed our appreciation of the function of the colon from an organ principally involved in the reabsorption of secretory fluids to a metabolic organ on a par with the liver. High-throughput technology has been applied to the identification of specific differences in microbial DNA, allowing the identification of trillions of microbes belonging to more than 1000 different species, with a metabolic mass of approximately 1.5 kg. The close proximity of these microbes with the mucosa and gut lymphoid tissue helps explain why a balanced microbiota is likely to preserve mucosal health, whereas an unbalanced composition, as seen in dysbiosis, may increase the prevalence of diseases not only of the mucosa but also within the body due to the strong interactions with the gut immune system, the largest immune organ of the body. Such abnormalities have been pinpointed as etiological factors in a wide range of diseases, including autoimmune disorders, allergy, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and colon cancer. Recognition of the strong potential for food to manipulate microbiota composition has opened up new therapeutic strategies against these diseases based on dietary intervention.},

   abstract = {Among gluten-related disorders, gluten sensitivity is an emerging entity that is characterized by a wide array of manifestations. In particular, patients complain of IBS-like symptoms and extraintestinal manifestations that occur shortly after the ingestion of gluten. Symptoms improve or disappear when gluten is withdrawn from the diet, and recur if gluten is reintroduced. Laboratory tests are usually unhelpful for diagnosis, although ~50% of patients are positive for IgG antigliadin antibodies. The natural history of gluten sensitivity is unknown; in particular, it is still to be clarified whether this disorder is permanent or transient and whether it is linked to autoimmunity. The pathogenesis of gluten sensitivity is unclear; data so far demonstrate a predominant activation of innate immune responses. Further research is necessary to establish the main clinicopathological features of gluten sensitivity, thus enabling physicians to improve their management of the increasing number of patients who are sensitive to dietary gluten.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterised by episodes of abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits. Many IBS sufferers believe that diet may play a role in triggering these episodes and may avoid certain foods. However relatively few studies have undertaken a dietary assessment in IBS sufferers to examine the wider impact of the condition upon diet. METHODS: 104 individuals with IBS were recruited and asked to complete a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The data were analysed against Dietary Reference Values for food energy and nutrients for the United Kingdom and observed intakes for the general population and for differences between IBS subtypes and the UK population. RESULTS: The data show that the dietary intakes of this population of IBS sufferers met the UK Dietary Reference Values. The average energy intake of the population exceeded the Estimated Average Requirements of the UK population and the balance of macronutrients was favourable. Intakes of selected micronutrients significantly exceeded the reference nutrient intakes. There were no differences between IBS subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The IBS subpopulation appear to have an adequate and balanced macronutrient intake with no evidence of inadequate micronutrient intake.},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 75 children (aging 3-14 years) with recurrent abdominal pain without gastrointestinal disease and fructose malabsorption followed a fructose restricted diet for 4 weeks. RESULTS: A median decline of weekly pain frequency from 4 (mean 3.64+1.6) before diet to 1 (mean 1.46+1.4; p<0.001) under fructose restriction was documented. The intensity of pain decreased from median 6 (mean 5.83+2.0) before intervention to median 3 (mean 3.4+2.5; p<0.001) with diet. Several additional life quality-influencing parameters such as daily stool frequency, nausea, problems to fall asleep, missed school days also improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that dietary fructose restriction represents a useful approach to address recurrent abdominal symptoms in children with fructose malabsorption.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cannabinoid receptors are located on cholinergic neurons. Genetic variants that affect endocannabinoid metabolism are associated with colonic transit in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with diarrhea. We compared the effects of dronabinol, a nonselective agonist of the cannabinoid receptor, with those of placebo on colonic motility and sensation in patients with IBS, and examined the effects of IBS subtype and specific genetic variants in cannabinoid mechanisms. METHODS: Seventy-five individuals with IBS (35 with IBS with constipation, 35 with IBS with diarrhea, and with 5 IBS alternating) were randomly assigned to groups that were given 1 dose of placebo or 2.5 mg or 5.0 mg dronabinol. We assessed left colonic compliance, motility index (MI), tone, and sensation during fasting and after a meal. We analyzed the single nucleotide polymorphisms CNR1 rs806378, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) rs324420, and MGLL rs4881. RESULTS: In all patients, dronabinol decreased fasting proximal left colonic MI compared with placebo (overall P = .05; for 5 mg dronabinol, P = .046), decreased fasting distal left colonic MI (overall P = .08; for 5 mg, P = .13), and increased colonic compliance (P = .058). The effects of dronabinol were greatest in patients with IBS with diarrhea or IBS alternating (proximal colonic MI, overall P = .022; compliance, overall P = .03). Dronabinol did not alter sensation or tone. CNR1 rs806378 (CC vs CT/TT) appeared to affect fasting proximal MI in all patients with IBS (P = .075). Dronabinol affected fasting distal MI in patients, regardless of FAAH rs324420 variant (CA/AA vs CC) (P = .046); the greatest effects were observed among IBS with constipation patients with the FAAH CC variant (P = .045). Dronabinol affected fasting proximal MI in patients with IBS with diarrhea or alternating with the variant FAAH CA/AA (P = .013). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IBS with diarrhea or alternating, dronabinol reduces fasting colonic motility; FAAH and CNR1 variants could influence the effects of this drug on colonic motility.},

METHODS: A Medline search was performed to identify all published studies relating to prevalence, diagnosis and treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders in New Zealand. RESULTS: Reflux prevalence is 30% and non-reflux dyspepsia is 34.2%. Helicobacter pylori prevalence varies considerably in NZ by geographical area and ethnicity and overall prevalence of infection is 24% in adults. 50% of patients with dyspepsia presenting for endoscopy in NZ will have no mucosal abnormality identified. National Dyspepsia Guidelines assist in management of patients. Guidelines exist for undifferentiated dyspepsia, Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD), H. pylori, peptic ulcer, NSAID's and gastrointestinal complications. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is reported by 21% of adults. Symptoms were more than twice as frequent and severe in females than males. Access to colonoscopy for investigation of bowel symptoms is limited in NZ and priority is given to patients with "alarm features". Non-invasive markers of inflammation, such as faecal calprotectin, are being used to differentiate the patient with functional diarrhoea from inflammatory bowel disease. Treatment for irritable bowel symptoms is targeted to the predominant symptom. CONCLUSIONS: Functional gastrointestinal disorders are common in New Zealand. There is increasing awareness of dietary management for functional bowel symptoms.},

Stool specimens were collected from 16 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 10 controls between July-November 2010. Stool microscopy and culture for B. hominis was performed. Drug susceptibility assays was done using 0.01 and 0.1 mg/ml of MTZ, garlic, ginger, white cumin, and black pepper. Effect was assessed on B. hominis culture after 48 h. Stool DNA was extracted using stool DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) done using subtype-specific sequence-tagged-site primers.

Exposed to black pepper at 0.1 mg/ml, cell count of B. hominis from IBS decreased to 1 x 10(5) (p = 0.01). B. hominis from IBS decreased to 1.3 x 10(5) exposed to ginger at 0.01 mg/ml (p = 0.001). B. hominis isolates were mostly genotypes 3, type 1 and 3 coinfection, and non-typeable B. hominis isolates. B. hominis isolates from IBS mostly genotype 1 demonstrated an increased sensitivity to garlic at 0.01 mg/ml with a B. hominis cell count of 3,714 compared to 6,142 when exposed to 0.01 mg/ml of MTZ. However, this sensitivity did not increase as garlic concentration was increased to 0.1 mg/ml, for B. hominis cell count was 6,000 compared to 1,428 as MTZ was increased to 0.1 mg/ml.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effects of lactase deficiency on digestive symptoms and diet in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have not been well defined. We assessed lactose absorption and tolerance and the intake of dairy products in healthy volunteers (controls) and patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS). METHODS: Sixty patients diagnosed with D-IBS at the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Hangzhou, China and 60 controls were given hydrogen breath tests to detect malabsorption and intolerance after administration of 10, 20, and 40 g lactose in random order 7-14 days apart; participants and researchers were blinded to the dose. We assessed associations between the results and self-reported lactose intolerance (LI). RESULTS: Malabsorption of 40 g lactose was observed in 93% of controls and 92% of patients with D-IBS. Fewer controls than patients with D-IBS were intolerant to 10 g lactose (3% vs 18%; odds ratio [OR], 6.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-30.8; P = .008), 20 g lactose (22% vs 47%; OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.43-7.02; P = .004), and 40 g lactose (68% vs 85%; OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.08-6.42; P = .03). H(2) excretion was associated with symptom score (P = .001). Patients with D-IBS self-reported LI more frequently than controls (63% vs 22%; OR, 6.25; 95% CI, 2.78-14.0; P < .001) and ate fewer dairy products (P = .040). However, self-reported LI did not correlate with results from hydrogen breath tests. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of LI is related to the dose of lactose ingested and intestinal gas production and is increased in patients with D-IBS. Self-reported LI, but not objective results from hydrogen breath tests, was associated with avoidance of dairy products.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder with a range of symptoms that significantly affect quality of life for patients. The difficulty of differential diagnosis and its treatment may significantly delay initiation of optimal therapy. Hence, persons with IBS often self-treat symptoms with non-prescribed pharmacological regimens and/or complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) and by modifying diet and daily activities. In addition, most common pharmacological approaches target IBS symptom management rather than treatment, and prescribed medications often result in significant side effects. The purposes of this review article are to: (1) address current issues related to IBS, including symptom presentation, diagnosis, and current treatment options; (2) summarize benefits and side effects of currently available pharmacological regimens and other symptom management strategies, with an emphasis on commonly used CAM therapies and diet modification; and (3) outline recommendations and future directions of IBS management based on systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and research findings.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study bowel patterns (function/habits) and its associated variables in an adult Saudi population. METHODS: In a cross sectional study, a 21-item questionnaire on bowel function (habits and frequency) was distributed to 10,000 high school students from all 5 regions of Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia, between February and April 2011. The randomly selected students, and 2 of their household or family members completed the questionnaire. Socio-demographic characteristics, eating habits, chronic diseases, and medications used were studied. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent (N=4918) were above the age of 16 years, of which 51.5% were males, and 88.1% were Saudis. It was observed that 18.1% of respondents perceived their bowel movements as being irregular and abnormal. There was no association between gender and abnormal/irregular bowel movement (OR: 0.89; p=0.13). Individuals over 60 years suffered from bowel pattern abnormalities (OR=1.8; p=0.01). Educational status (secondary), occupation (teacher and unemployed), diet habits, and chronic diseases of study subjects were also statistically significantly associated with their bowel movements. Respondents consuming more vegetables, fruits, meats, dairy products, and rice had significantly more normal bowel movements. Females tended to defecate less frequently as compared with males (p<0.0001). Approximately 40% of both genders have bowel movements at least once a day. CONCLUSION: Our results may serve as a baseline for appropriate intervention strategies, and also for future studies to substantiate, negate, or add more observations/conclusions.},
