   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To assess the reliability and validity of IMPACT-III (HR), a disease-specific, health-related quality of life instrument in Croatian children with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: In a multicenter study, 104 children participated in a validation study of IMPACT-III (HR) cross-culturally adapted for Croatia. Factor analysis was used to determine optimal domain structure for this cohort, analysis of Cronbach's alpha coefficients to test internal reliability, ANOVA to assess discriminant validity, and correlation with Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Version 4.0 (PedsQL) using Pearson correlation coefficients to assess concurrent validity. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha for the IMPACT-III (HR) total score was 0.92. The most robust factor solution was a 5-domain structure: Symptoms, Concerns, Socializing, Body Image, and Worry about Stool, all of which demonstrated good internal reliability (alpha=0.60-0.89), but two items were dropped to achieve this. Discriminant validity was demonstrated by significant differences (P<0.001) in mean IMPACT-III (HR) scores between quiescent and mild or moderate-severe disease activity groups for total (148 vs. 139 or 125) and following factor scores: Symptoms (84 vs. 71 or 61), Socializing (91 vs. 83 or 76), and Worry about Stool (significant only between quiescent and moderate-severe groups, 90 vs. 62, respectively). Concurrent validity of IMPACT-III (HR) with PedsQL showed significant correlation, which was strongest when similar domains were compared. CONCLUSION: IMPACT-III (HR) appears to be useful tool to measure health-related quality of life in Croatian children with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To assess infliximab pharmacokinetics in pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: This phase 3, randomized, open-label multicenter study enrolled 60 children (6-17 yr) with moderate-to-severely active UC (Mayo score, 6-12; endoscopic subscore, >/=2), despite conventional therapy. Patients received infliximab 5-mg/kg induction infusions at weeks 0, 2, and 6. Week 8 clinical responders (n = 45) were randomized to infliximab 5 mg/kg given every 8 weeks (q8w) through week 46 or every 12 weeks (q12w) through week 42. Patients losing response during maintenance infliximab were eligible to increase the dose (5-->10 mg/kg) and/or shorten the dosing interval (q12w-->q8w). Blood samples were collected for infliximab concentration and pharmacokinetic determinations. RESULTS: Infliximab pharmacokinetics were not influenced by age (6-11 yr versus 12-17 yr), baseline immunomodulator use, or the extent of UC. At week 8, higher serum infliximab concentrations (>/=41.1 mug/mL) were associated with greater proportions of patients achieving efficacy endpoints (clinical response, 92.9%; mucosal healing, 92.9%; and clinical remission, 64.3%) versus those with lower serum concentrations (<18.1 mug/mL; 53.9%, 53.9%, and 30.8%, respectively). At week 30, higher median trough serum infliximab concentrations were observed with infliximab 5 mg/kg q8w (1.9 mug/mL) versus q12w (0.8 mug/mL) and with infliximab 10 mg/kg (2.9 mug/mL) versus 5 mg/kg (1.1 mug/mL) among patients who are regimen adjusted. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab pharmacokinetics/exposure-response relationship in patients with UC aged 6 to 17 years were generally comparable with those observed in reference adult UC populations, supporting using infliximab 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6 followed by maintenance dosing with 5 mg/kg q8w in these patients. A positive relationship was noted between serum infliximab level and clinical effect following induction therapy similar to adults.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: The human/microbiota cross-talk is partially mediated by bacteria-derived peptides like Serine-Threonine peptide (STp), which is resistant to gut proteolysis, is found in the human healthy colon and induces regulatory properties on gut dendritic cells (DCs); here we characterized human gut DC in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and studied the effect of STp on their properties. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human colonic DC from healthy controls and UC patients were isolated, conditioned for 24 h +/- STp and characterized by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Expression of immature DC markers DC-SIGN and ILT3, and Toll-like receptors were increased on gut UC-DC. Langerin (involved in phagocytosis), lymph node homing marker CCR7, and activation markers CD40/CD80/CD86 were decreased in UC. Gut DC had restricted stimulatory capacity for T-cells in UC. Conditioning of DC with STp in vitro reduced Toll-like receptor expression, increased CD40 and CD80 expression, and restored their stimulatory capacity. CONCLUSION: Colonic DCs display an abnormal immature phenotype in UC, which was partially restored following STp treatment. Bacteria-derived metabolites, like STp, seem to have a role in gut homeostasis that is missing in UC so they might lead a new era of probiotic products setting the basis for nondrug dietary therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Poor sleep quality is associated with adverse health consequences. Sleep disturbances can impact the immune function and process of inflammation. The relationship between sleep quality and the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been well studied. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was performed to assess the correlation of the quality of sleep and disease activity in IBD. We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to measure sleep quality. IBD disease activity was measured by using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or Modified Mayo Score. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were enrolled with mean age of 37 +/- 15.4 years and 27 (66%) women. Abnormal PSQI was present in all 23 (100%) of the clinically active patients and in 13 (72%) of those with inactive disease (odds ratio = 2.8, P = 0.007). All 30 patients with histologic evidence of inflammation on recent ileocolonoscopy also had abnormal PSQI scores, which were independent of their clinical disease activity status. Only 6 of 11 patients with histologically quiescent disease had abnormal PSQI scores (odds ratio = 6.0, P < 0.0001). There was no difference in disease type, use of steroids, the presence of depression or anxiety, and body mass index between the patients with normal and abnormal sleep. An abnormal PSQI had a positive predictive value for histologic inflammatory activity of 83%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a strong association between clinically active IBD and poor sleep quality and demonstrate that patients in clinical remission with abnormal sleep have a high likelihood of subclinical disease activity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early-onset (EO) pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) seem to be more extensive than those with a later onset. To test this hypothesis, we examined the phenotype and disease course of patients with IBD diagnosis at 0 to 5 years, compared with the ranges 6 to 11 and 12 to 18 years. METHODS: Anatomic locations and behaviors were assessed according to Paris classification in 506 consecutive patients: 224 Crohn's disease, 245 ulcerative colitis, and 37 IBD-unclassified. RESULTS: Eleven percent of patients were in the range 0 to 5 years, 39% in 6 to 11 years, and 50% in 12 to 18 years. Ulcerative colitis was the most frequent diagnosis in EO-IBD and in 6- to 11-year-old group, whereas Crohn's disease was predominant in older children. A classification as IBD-unclassified was more common in the range 0 to 5 years compared with the other groups (P < 0.005). EO Crohn's disease showed a more frequent isolated colonic (P < 0.005) and upper gastrointestinal involvement than later-onset disease. Sixty-two percent of the patients in the 0 to 5 years range had pancolonic ulcerative colitis, compared with 38% of 6 to 11 years (P = 0.02) and 31% of 12-18 years (P = 0.002) range. No statistical difference for family history for IBD was found in the 3-year age groups. Therapies at the diagnosis were similar for all children. However, at latest follow-up, a significantly higher proportion of younger children were under steroids compared with older groups (P < 0.05). Surgical risk did not differ according to age. CONCLUSIONS: EO-IBD exhibits an extensive phenotype and benefit from aggressive treatment strategies, although surgical risk is similar to later-onset disease. A family history for IBD is not common in EO disease.},

   abstract = {IBD includes two classic entities, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and a third undetermined form (IBD-U), characterized by a chronic relapsing course resulting in a high rate of morbidity and impaired quality of life. Children with IBD are vulnerable in terms of growth failure, malnutrition and emotional effects. The aims of therapy have now transitioned from symptomatic control to the achievement of mucosal healing and deep remission. This type of therapy has been made possible by the advent of disease-modifying drugs, such as biologic agents, which are capable of interrupting the inflammatory cascade underlying IBD. Biologic agents are generally administered in patients who are refractory to conventional therapies. However, there is growing support that such agents could be used in the initial phases of the disease, typically in paediatric patients, to interrupt and cease the inflammatory process. Until several years ago, most therapeutic programmes in paediatric patients with IBD were borrowed from adult trials, whereas paediatric studies were often retrospective and uncontrolled. However, guidelines on therapeutic management of paediatric IBD and controlled, prospective, randomized trials including children with IBD have now been published. Here, the current knowledge concerning treatment options for children with IBD are reported. We also highlight the effectiveness and safety of new therapeutic advances in these paediatric patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are 2 common inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) associated with intestinal inflammation and tissue damage. Oxidative stress is suggested to play a major role in the initiation and progression of IBD. Vitamin C (ascorbate, ascorbic acid) supplementation has reduced oxidative stress in persons with IBD. The role of ascorbate transporters in IBD remains to be determined. SLC23A1 is a major ascorbate transporter in the intestinal tract, and some of its genetic variants have been associated with severely decreased ascorbate transport and lower systemic concentrations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether common genetic variants in the vitamin C transporter SLC23A1 are associated with the risk of IBD. DESIGN: Genomic DNA samples from patients with CD (n = 162) and UC (n = 149) from the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study and ethnically matched controls (n = 142) were genotyped for 3 SLC23A1 polymorphisms (rs6596473, rs33972313, and rs10063949) by using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Variation at rs10063949 (G allele for heterozygote and homozygote) was associated with increased susceptibility to CD (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.38, 4.66; OR: 4.72; 95% CI: 2.53, 8.81; P < 0.0001; respectively). A strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed across the SLC23A1 region (variation rs6596473 with rs10063949) for CD and UC (D' = 0.94 and 0.96, respectively). The risk alleles confirmed a haplotype (CGG) that is carried more in CD patients (65.3%, P < 0.0001) than in controls (43.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A genetic variant (rs10063949-G) in the SLC23A1 ascorbate transporter locus was identified and is associated with an increased risk of CD in a white Canadian IBD cohort. The presented evidence that SLC23A1 variations can modulate the risk of CD has implications for understanding ascorbate transport in CD patients and provides a novel opportunity toward individualized nutritional therapy for patients carrying the disease-associated genotype.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sleep deprivation is associated with production of inflammatory cytokines. Disturbed sleep quality has been associated with increased risk of disease flare in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the association between sleep and risk of incident CD and UC has not been previously examined. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of women who were enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) I since 1976 and NHS II since 1989 and followed through detailed biennial questionnaires with >90% follow-up. We examined the association of sleep duration reported in 1986 in NHS I and 2001 in NHS II with incident CD and UC, diagnosed through 2010, in NHS I and 2009 in NHS II. Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 151,871 women, we confirmed 191 cases of CD (incidence, 8/100,000 person-years) and 230 cases of UC (incidence, 10/100,000 person-years) over 2,292,849 person-years. Compared with women with reported usual sleep durations of 7-8 h/day (incidence, 8/100,000 person-years), women with reported sleep duration <6 h/day (11/100,000 person-years) or >9 h/day (20/100,000 person-years) had a higher incidence of UC (P < .05). The multivariate hazard ratios for UC were 1.51 (95% CI, 1.10-2.09) for sleep durations <6 h/day and 2.05 (95% CI, 1.44-2.92) for sleep durations >9 h/day, compared with sleep durations of 7-8 h/day. In contrast, sleep duration did not modify risk of CD. Duration of rotating night shift work was not associated with CD or UC. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of data from the NHS I and II, less than 6 hours sleep/day and more than 9 hours sleep/day are each associated with an increased risk of UC. Further studies are needed to evaluate sleep as a modifiable risk factor in the pathogenesis and progression of IBD.},

   abstract = {We performed a prospective study of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases to examine variations in treatment among medical centers. In a prospective cohort study of 1659 patients with Crohn's disease and 946 patients with ulcerative colitis seen at 7 high-volume referral centers, we collected data on demographics, disease characteristics, and medical and surgical treatments. We used logistic regression to determine differences in treatment among centers, controlling for potential confounders. We found significant variations among centers in the treatment of Crohn's disease with immunomodulators (odds ratio [OR], 3.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09-5.32) but not anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.97-2.77). There was less variation in the treatment of ulcerative colitis; we found no difference in use of immunomodulators (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.00-3.36) or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.40-1.65). The development and implementation of evidence-based standards of care for inflammatory bowel disease may help reduce variation and improve outcomes.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Serious infections are an important side effect of immunosuppressive therapy used to treat Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). There have been no nationally representative studies examining the spectrum of infection related hospitalizations in patients with IBD. METHODS: Our study consisted of all adult CD and UC related hospitalizations from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2007, a national hospitalization database in the United States. We then identified all infection-related hospitalizations through codes for either the specific infections or disease processes (sepsis, pneumonia, etc.). Predictors of infections as well as the excess morbidity associated with infections were determined using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: There were an estimated 67,221 hospitalizations related to infections in IBD patients, comprising 27.5% of all IBD hospitalizations. On multivariate analysis, infections were independently associated with age, co-morbidity, malnutrition, TPN, and bowel surgery. Infection-related hospitalizations had a four-fold greater mortality (OR 4.4, 95% CI 3.7-5.2). However, this varied by type of infection with the strongest effect seen for sepsis (OR 15.3, 95% CI 12.4-18.6), pneumonia (OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.9-4.5) and C. difficile (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.6-4.0), and weaker effects for urinary infections (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.1-1.7). Infections were also associated with an estimated 2.3 days excess hospital stay (95% CI 2.2-2.5) and $12,482 in hospitalization charges. CONCLUSION: Infections account for significant morbidity and mortality in patients with IBD and disproportionately impact older IBD patients with greater co-morbidity. Pneumonia, sepsis and C difficile infection are associated with the greatest excess mortality risk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) agents have become widely used in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). So far, only few studies examined the long-term results of anti-TNFalpha treatment in children with IBD. METHODS: The long-term outcome of pediatric patients with IBD was assessed retrospectively in a multicenter cohort of children treated with anti-TNFalpha beyond induction treatment. Short- and long-term response rates, predictors for loss of response, data on growth and laboratory parameters were assessed. RESULTS: 120 patients [101 crohn's disease (CD), 19 ulcerative colitis (UC) or indeterminate colitis (IC)] received either infliximab or adalimumab. The mean age at initiation of anti-TNFalpha was 13.4 +/- 3.9 years and the median duration of anti-TNFalpha treatment was 15 months (range: 2-90). Overall, 89% of the cohort experienced short-term response following induction. Response was associated with improvement in weight and BMI Z-scores (p<0.001) but not with linear growth. Responders experienced a significant decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) during treatment (p<0.001). Albumin and hemoglobin both improved but only albumin increased significantly (p<0.001). The cumulative probability of losing response to anti-TNFalpha treatment was 17%, 38%, and 49% after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Responders had a significantly lower weight and BMI Z-scores at initiation of anti-TNFalpha treatment in compared to non-responders (p=0.04 and 0.02 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our long term cohort supports the current evidence on the effectiveness and safety of anti-TNFalpha treatment in children with IBD. Response to treatment was interestingly associated with lower weight and BMI.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Peritoneal adhesions, the fibrotic bands that form between the surfaces in the peritoneal cavity following surgery, still pose a difficult clinical challenge. AIM: To evaluate the SprayShield Adhesion Barrier System (PEG ester amine solution and a buffer solution) in reducing post-operative adhesion formation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective, multi-center, randomized, single blind study. A total of 11 subjects diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC) or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) were randomized: 8 to the SprayShield arm and 3 to the control arm. SprayShield was applied on the viscera directly under the midline peritoneal incision and at the site of ileostomy. During the follow-up surgery, the incidence, extent, and severity of post-operative adhesion formation were evaluated, as well as the time required to mobilize the ileal loop. RESULTS: In patients who received SprayShield the time required to mobilize the ileal loop at the ileostomy closure was slightly shorter and the incidence and severity of adhesions were somewhat lower vs. control subjects (NS). CONCLUSIONS: SprayShield was found to be easy to use, safe, and quick to apply, and performed well in adherence and conformity. The incidence and severity of adhesions were lower for SprayShield subjects vs. control subjects, but due to the limited number of patients there are not enough data to confirm the effectiveness of the SprayShield Adhesion Barrier System in prevention of adhesions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clostridium difficile is the major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and is the most well known bacterial pathogen associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens has also been detected in up to 15% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea cases, and it has not been found in healthy people. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of C. perfringens infection in pediatric patients with IBD. METHODS: This was a prospective, controlled study evaluating pediatric IBD patients in the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition in Warsaw, Poland. All of the patients were diagnosed according to the Porto criteria. There were two control groups: (1) non-IBD patients that were suspected for bacterial diarrhea and (2) healthy children. Stool samples were collected on the day of admission. C. perfringens infection diagnosis was based on a positive stool enzyme immunoassay (C. perfringens enterotoxin test kit TechLab). RESULTS: 91 fecal specimens from patients with IBD were collected. The average patient age was 11.7 years in IBD group, 7.4 years in non-IBD patients with diarrhea, and 7.4 years in healthy children. The prevalence of C. perfringens infection was 9% (8/91; CI 95% 4.6-16.4). There were more Crohn's patients (6/8) in the C. perfringens positive group. There was no C. perfringens infection in the two control groups. CONCLUSION: Our pilot data add evidence to the hypothesis that Clostridia other than C. difficile may play a significant role in the clinical course of IBD. However, further studies are needed to confirm this.},

Of patients with IBD, 7.8% received an influenza vaccine, compared to 18.3% of controls (P = 0.0013). There were no statistically significant differences in time from IBD diagnosis, disease activity and in drugs, between vaccinated and non-vaccinated IBD children. In conclusion, the data of our study demonstrate an alarmingly poor influenza vaccination status in the majority of children with IBD. Therefore, there is an unmet need to implement better influenza vaccination strategies for this group of patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Eosinophils are implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A subset of IBD patients develops blood eosinophilia, and the clinical profile of these patients is undefined. We sought to characterize IBD patients with and without eosinophilia. METHODS: We studied a prospective registry of 1,176 IBD patients followed in a tertiary referral center. Patients who developed eosinophilia at any time were identified by electronic medical record query. We performed a chart review case-control study comparing patients with recurrent eosinophilia versus randomly selected disease-matched patients with no history of eosinophilia. Histological analysis was performed on selected cases and controls. RESULTS: Eosinophilia at any time was more prevalent in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients than Crohn's disease patients (22.2 versus 12.7%), as was recurrent eosinophilia (3.4 versus 0.7%). UC patients with recurrent eosinophilia were predominantly male compared with the control UC population (81.3 versus 46.9%) and had higher rates of colectomy for either medically refractory disease or dysplasia/cancer than control UC patients (56.3 versus 15.6%). Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) occurred in 37.5% of UC patients with recurrent eosinophilia compared with only 3.1% in the UC controls. Histological analysis of random diagnostic samples from UC patients with recurrent eosinophilia demonstrated a normal eosinophil pattern as seen in the control UC population. CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophilia-associated UC is a subgroup of IBD associated with severe colitis and PSC. Further studies are warranted to characterize molecular mechanisms underlying eosinophilia-associated UC and to determine optimal approaches for therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The elderly represent a growing demographic of patients with IBD. No study has previously described variations in care or medication prescriptions in senior patients with IBD. We compared prescription rates among elderly patients with IBD in four countries using health administrative data. METHODS: Databases from the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Denmark and Canada were queried. Variation in prescription rates between countries was assessed in patients >/=65y with prevalent IBD who had >/=1 prescription for an IBD-related medication in a given quarter between 2004 and 2009. Patients were identified using previously-reported, validated algorithms. Country-specific rates were compared in each quarter using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: In patients with Crohn's disease, Canada and US had higher prescription rates for oral 5-ASA (P<0.0001 in all quarters) and infliximab (P<0.05 in 22/24 quarters), while the US had higher rates of thiopurine usage (P<0.05 in 23/24 quarters). Canada had greater rates of methotrexate prescriptions (P<0.05 in 21/24 quarters analyzed). In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), rates of oral steroid usage was lowest in the US (P<0.05 in 22/24 quarters) and oral 5-ASA use was highest in the US and Canada (P<0.0001 in all quarters). Canada and Denmark used more rectal therapy than the US. Infliximab usage in UC was significantly higher in the US and Canada after 2006. CONCLUSIONS: Significant variation in medication prescription rates exists among countries. Future research should assess whether these differences were associated with disparities in outcomes and health care costs.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Health administrative databases can be used to track disease incidence, outcomes, and care quality. Case validation is necessary to ensure accurate disease ascertainment using these databases. In this study, we aimed to validate adult-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) identification algorithms. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We used two large cohorts of incident patients from Ontario, Canada to validate algorithms. We linked information extracted from charts to health administrative data and compared the accuracy of various algorithms. In addition, we validated an algorithm to distinguish patients with Crohn's from those with ulcerative colitis and assessed the adequate look-back period to distinguish incident from prevalent cases. RESULTS: Over 5,000 algorithms were tested. The most accurate algorithm to identify patients 18 to 64 years at diagnosis was five physician contacts or hospitalizations within 4 years (sensitivity, 76.8%; specificity, 96.2%; positive predictive value (PPV), 81.4%; negative predictive value (NPV), 95.0%). In patients >/=65 years at diagnosis, adding a pharmacy claim for an IBD-related medication improved accuracy. CONCLUSION: Patients with adult-onset incident IBD can be accurately identified from within health administrative data. The validated algorithms will be applied to administrative data to expand the Ontario Crohn's and Colitis Cohort to all patients with IBD in the province of Ontario.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Paris pediatric modification of the Montreal classification defines very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) as a form of IBD distinct from that of older children. We compared the incidence and outcomes of VEO-IBD with those of IBD in older children. METHODS: We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study of all children diagnosed with IBD in Ontario, Canada, from 1994 through 2009. Trends in standardized incidence were calculated using Poisson regression. We compared outpatient and emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and surgeries among children diagnosed with IBD when they were younger than age 6, ages 6-9.9, and older than age 10 years. Multivariable models were adjusted for income and stratified by sex. RESULTS: The incidence of IBD increased from 9.4 per 100,000 children (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.2-10.8/100,000 children) in 1994 to 13.2 per 100,000 children (95% CI, 11.9-14.6/100,000 children) in 2009 (P < .0001). The incidence increased by 7.4% per year among children younger than 6 years old and 6-9.9 years old, and by 2.2% per year among children >/=10 years old. IBD-related outpatient visits were less frequent among children <6 years old than >/=10 years old (odds ratio for female patients, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.58-0.78; odds ratio for male patients, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.98). Hazard ratios [HRs] for hospitalization were lower for children <6 years old (female HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.87; male HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.94-1.33) than for older children. HRs for surgery among children <6 years old with Crohn's disease were 0.35 for female patients (95% CI, 0.16-0.78) and 0.59 for male patients (95% CI, 0.34-0.99). HRs for children <6 years old with ulcerative colitis were 0.88 for female patients (95% CI, 0.47-1.63) and 0.42 for male patients (95% CI, 0.21-0.85). There was no difference in hospitalization or surgery rates among children 6-9.9 years old vs those >/=10 years old. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a retrospective cohort study, the incidence of VEO-IBD increased from 1994 through 2009. Children diagnosed with IBD before they were 6 years old used fewer health services and had lower rates of surgery than children diagnosed when they were 10 years or older.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: International cohort studies have reported increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in recent years, and Canada has among the highest rates of IBD in the world. This study assessed incidence and prevalence of IBD in Ontario, the most populous province of Canada, to determine changing trends in age of onset. METHODS: We used a population-based cohort derived from validated health administrative data consisting of all Ontario residents living with IBD from 1999 to 2008. We determined trends over time using Poisson regression analysis, assessing rates in 10-year age groups, children, adults, and the elderly. RESULTS: In 2008, 68,071 people were living with IBD among 12,738,350 people (standardized prevalence 534.3 per 100,000 people). Between 1999 and 2008, standardized IBD incidence increased from 21.3 to 26.2 per 100,000 (2.3% per yr, P < 0.0001). Incidence of Crohn's increased from 9.6 to 12.1 per 100,000 (1.9% per yr, P < 0.0001). Ulcerative colitis incidence increased from 10.7 to 12.1 per 100,000 (2.0% per yr, P < 0.0001). For IBD, incidence increased significantly in people younger than 10 years of age (9.7% per yr, P < 0.0001), 10 to 19 years of age (3.8% per yr, P < 0.0001), 30 to 39 years of age (1.8% per yr, P = 0.0006), 40 to 49 years of age (2.8% per yr, P = 0.0001), and 50 to 59 years of age (2.8% per yr, P < 0.0001). Incidence was stable in patients older than 65 years of age at diagnosis (-0.1% per yr, P = 0.73). Although incidence did not change significantly over time in adults 20 to 29 years, IBD incidence peaked in this age group. CONCLUSIONS: Ontario has among the highest prevalence of IBD in the world. Incidence of IBD increased between 1999 and 2008, owing to increased incidence in children and adults, with stable rates in elderly people. These findings demonstrate the changing age demographics and growing burden of IBD in Ontario, Canada.},

   abstract = {Thiopurines have been used in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for >30 years, and measurements of both thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and thiopurine (TP) metabolites, 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) and 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP), have been readily available. The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) Committee on Inflammatory Bowel Disease thought it appropriate to review the present indications for use of TPMT and TP metabolite testing. Substantial evidence demonstrates that TP therapy is useful for both Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. Review of the existing data yielded the following recommendations. TPMT testing is recommended before initiation of TPs to identify individuals who are homozygote recessive or have extremely low TPMT activity, with the latter having more reliability than the former. Individuals who are homozygous recessive or have extremely low TPMT activity should avoid the use of TPs because of concerns for significant leukopenia. TMPT testing does not predict all cases of leukopenia and has no value to predict hypersensitivity adverse effects such as pancreatitis. Any potential value to reduce the risk of malignancy has not been studied. All individuals taking TPs should have routine monitoring with complete blood cell count and white blood cell count differential to evaluate for leukopenia regardless of TPMT testing results. Metabolite testing can be used to determine adherence with TP therapy. Metabolite testing can be used to guide dose increases or modifications in patients with active disease. Consideration would include either increasing the dose, changing therapy or for those with elevated transaminases or an elevated 6-MMP, using adjunctive allopurinol to help raise 6-thioguanine metabolites and suppress formation of 6-MMP. Routine and repetitive metabolite testing has little or no role in patients who are doing well and taking an acceptable dose of a TP.},

   abstract = {The dysbiosis theory of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) posits that there is an alteration in the gut microbiome as an important underpinning of disease etiology. It stands to reason then, that administering agents that could impact on the balance of microbes on the gut could be impactful on the course of IBD. Herein is a review of the controlled trials undertaken to assess the use of antibiotics that would kill or suppress potentially injurious microbes, probiotics that would overpopulate the gut with potentially beneficial microbes or prebiotics that provide a metabolic substrate that enhances the growth of potentially beneficial microbes. With regard to antibiotics, the best data are for the use of nitroimadoles postoperatively in Crohn's disease (CD) to prevent disease recurrence. Otherwise, the data are limited with the regard to any lasting benefit of antibiotics sustaining remission in either CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). A recent meta-analysis concluded that antibiotics are superior to placebo at inducing remission in CD or UC, although the meta-analysis grouped a variety of antibiotics with different spectra of activity. Despite the absence of robust clinical trial data, antibiotics are widely used to treat perineal fistulizing CD and acute and chronic pouchitis. Probiotics have not been shown to have a beneficial role in CD. However, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 has comparable effects to low doses of mesalamine in maintaining remission in UC. VSL#3, a combination of 8 microbes, has been shown to have an effect in inducing remission in UC and preventing pouchitis. Prebiotics have yet to be shown to have an effect in any form of IBD, but to date controlled trials have been small. The use of antibiotics should be balanced against the risks they pose. Even probiotics may pose some risk and should not be assumed to be innocuous especially when ingested by persons with a compromised epithelial barrier. Prebiotics may not be harmful but may cause gastrointestinal side effects. Finally, the timing of ingestion of antibiotics and other dietary factors that may function as prebiotics, especially in early childhood, may be critical in shaping the gut microbiome and ultimately predisposing to or preventing IBD. Finding ways to impact on the gut microbiome to alter the course of IBD makes good sense, but should be undertaken in the setting of rigorously performed controlled trials to ensure that the interventions are truly effective and well tolerated.},

   abstract = {AIM: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) carry similar clinical and biological properties. Both are characterized with chronic inflammation attacks and neutrophil migration and impaired apoptosis mechanism are present in the areas of damage in both conditions. In our study, we aimed to determine the frequency of association of FMF in patients with IBD, to compare the demographic, clinical, laboratory and treatment response properties in these patients with the ones in other IBD patients and to determine association of FMF especially in treatment-resistant patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients who were being followed up with a diagnosis of IBD aged between 0 and 18 years were included in the study. The patient group included the patients who were diagnosed with IBD according to clinical, serological, endoscopic and histopathological criteria, who were being followed up and whose therapies were continuing. Genetic analysis in terms of MEFV gene mutations was performed in all patients with a diagnosis of IBD. Acute phase reactants, complete blood count, immunoglobulin levels, stool analysis, "perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies" (pANCA) and "anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies" (ASCA) were studied at the time of diagnosis. The diagnosis of FMF was made according to detailed history, physical examination findings, laboratory tests and the results of genetic analyses in terms of MEFV gene mutations in accordance with the criteria defined in 2009. RESULTS: We found that FMF accompanied in 14 (26.4%) of the patients who had a diagnosis of IBD. 3 of these 14 patients in whom FMF accompanied were being followed up with a diagnosis of Crohn disease and 11 were being followed up with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. All of these patients had MEFV gene mutation. These mutations included M694V (50%), K695R (21.4%), M680I (14.3%) and R202Q (14.3%) in order of frequency. When the laboratory data were compared between the patients who had a diagnosis of IBD alone and who had a diagnosis of IBD plus FMF, it was observed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) values were statistically significantly higher in the IBD+FMF group. CONCLUSIONS: FMF is a common condition in the Turkish population and M694V mutation is found most commonly. In our study, this status did not change in cases where FMF accompanied IBD, but K695R mutation was found more frequently compared to FMF alone. We think that it should be kept in mind that other inflammatory conditions including mainly FMF may accompany IBD, if a case of IBD does not have an expected course or is resistant to treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been a dramatic increase in investigations on the potential mechanistic role of the intestinal microbiota in various diseases and factors modulating intestinal microbial composition. We recently reported on intestinal microbial shifts after smoking cessation in humans. In this study, we aimed to conduct further microbial analyses and verify our previous results obtained by pyrosequencing using a direct quantitative microbial approach. METHODS: Stool samples of healthy smoking human subjects undergoing controlled smoking cessation during a 9-week observational period were analyzed and compared with 2 control groups, ongoing smoking and nonsmoking subjects. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was applied to quantify specific bacterial groups. RESULTS: Intestinal microbiota composition was substantially altered after smoking cessation as characterized by an increase in key representatives from the phyla of Firmicutes (Clostridium coccoides, Eubacterium rectale, and Clostridium leptum subgroup) and Actinobacteria (HGC bacteria and Bifidobacteria) as well as a decrease in Bacteroidetes (Prevotella spp. and Bacteroides spp.) and Proteobacteria (beta- and gamma-subgroup of Proteobacteria). CONCLUSIONS: As determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, an independent direct quantitative microbial approach, we could confirm that intestinal microbiota composition in humans is influenced by smoking. The characteristics of observed microbial shifts suggest a potential mechanistic association to alterations in body weight subsequent to smoking cessation. More importantly, regarding previously described microbial hallmarks of dysbiosis in inflammatory bowel diseases, a variety of observed microbial alterations after smoking cessation deserve further consideration in view of the divergent effect of smoking on the clinical course of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are both chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) characterized by a cyclical nature, which alternates between active and quiescent states, ultimately impairing a patients' quality of life. The etiology of IBD is not known but it likely involves a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental risk factors. Physical exercise has been suggested to provide protection against the onset of IBD, but there are inconsistencies in the findings of the published literature. Current research recommends exercise to help counteract some IBD-specific complications and preliminary studies suggest that physical activity may be beneficial in reducing the symptoms of IBD. Obesity is becoming more prevalent in patients diagnosed with IBD and may be associated with higher disease activity. There is evidence that adipokines are involved in the inflammatory and metabolic pathways. Hypertrophy of the mesenteric white adipose tissue has been long recognized as a characteristic feature of Crohn's disease; however its importance is unknown. Recent data suggest that dysregulation of adipokine secretion by white adipose tissue is involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Skeletal muscle was shown to produce biologically active myokines, which could be a important contributor to the beneficial effects of exercise. There is mounting evidence for the bi-directional endocrine cross talk between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The objective of the present review is to explore the role of exercise and its impact on IBD. Also, we discuss how current discoveries regarding the importance of adipokines and myokines and their cross talk expand our view of the pathological changes and the therapeutic options for IBD.},

   abstract = {The number of microorganisms inhabiting the human digestive tract exceeds the number of body cells by a factor of ten. This microbial community affects host physiology and host health. The metabolic potential of the gut microbiota is immense affording the extraction of energy from otherwise indigestible carbohydrates (dietary fiber) and the conversion of host-derived substances, non-nutritive dietary components and drugs. Recognized functions of the gut microbiota include provision of colonization resistance against pathogens and priming of both the innate and the acquired immune systems. However, the intestinal microbiota may also contribute to the development of diseases such as ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer. Culture-dependent studies provided basic knowledge on the gut microbiota, but only the advent of culture-independent molecular methods led to a better understanding of host-microbe interactions. The application of metagenomics to the gut microbial ecosystem revealed truly remarkable correlations between certain diseases and the gut microbiome. It also led to the suggestion of the existence of a 'core microbiome' that encompasses key functions shared by each individual. However, the mechanisms underlying host-microbe interactions have not yet been unraveled.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Monitoring of mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is of major importance. New noninvasive markers for intestinal inflammation are needed. Previous studies have reported that pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) correlates with clinical activity in IBD subgroups. Our aim was to investigate the correlation of serum and fecal PAP with clinical and biochemical parameters of disease activity in a real-life IBD cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and five consecutive IBD patients were enrolled. Clinical disease activity was scored by the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index; also, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and fecal calprotectin were determined. As surrogate for endoscopy, a combination score of clinical indices with CRP or calprotectin was used to define active disease. Fecal and serum PAP were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: The median serum and fecal PAP did not differ in Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with active compared with inactive disease according to clinical activity indices. Defining active disease by a combination score of Harvey-Bradshaw Index of more than 4 and CRP of more than 5 mg/l or calprotectin more than 250 microg/g, serum PAP (P=0.01), but not fecal PAP (P=0.32), was significantly higher in active than inactive CD patients. Area under the curve of the corresponding receiver operating curve (ROC) was 0.64. No differences were found in serum or fecal PAP levels using the combination score for active disease in UC. CONCLUSION: Serum but not fecal PAP was higher in active compared with nonactive CD and may reflect mucosal inflammation in CD, but not in UC. However, the accuracy of serum PAP for the diagnosis of active disease was poor, and therefore, serum PAP does not seem to have additional value compared with the current noninvasive markers.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Immune tolerance breakdown during UC involves the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), a key factor in mucosal homoeostasis and the therapeutic target of 5-aminosalycilates, which expression is impaired during UC. Here we assess the impact of glucocorticoids (GCs) on PPARgamma expression, focusing especially on extra-adrenal cortisol production by colonic epithelial cells (CECs). METHODS: Activation of PPARgamma in the colon was evaluated using transgenic mice for the luciferase gene under PPAR control (peroxisome proliferator response element-luciferase mice). Protein and mRNA expression of PPARgamma were evaluated with colon fragments and purified CEC from mice. Cortisol production and steroidogenic factor expression were quantified in human CEC of patients with UC and those of controls. Gene expression knockdown by short hairpin RNA in Caco-2 cells was used for functional studies. RESULTS: GCs were able to raise luciferase activity in peroxisome proliferator response element-luciferase mice. In the mice colons and Caco-2 cells, PPARgamma expression was increased either with GCs or with an inducer of steroidogenesis and then decreased after treatment with a steroidogenesis inhibitor. Cortisol production and steroidogenic factor expression, such as liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1), were decreased in CEC isolated from patients with UC, directly correlating with PPARgamma impairment. Experiments on Caco-2 cells lacking LRH-1 expression confirmed that LRH-1 controls PPARgamma expression by regulating GC synthesis in CEC. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate cortisol control of PPARgamma expression in CEC, highlighting cortisol production deficiency in colonocytes as a key molecular event in the pathophysiology of UC.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Calcium deficiency is considered a risk factor for the development of osteoporosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Various dietary restrictions, including milk products are reported by these patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate dairy product and dietary calcium intake by IBD patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 65 outpatients with IBD recruited from one reference center for IBD. A semi-structured questionnaire (to collect demographic, socioeconomic and clinical data) and a quantitative food frequency questionnaire were administered. With regard to clinical data, we evaluated the anthropometric nutritional status, the disease classification, the disease activity index and the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Self-reported modifications in the use of dairy products were evaluated. RESULTS: The IBD patients' ages ranged from 20-75 years and 67.0% were diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. The majority (64.7%) reported restricting dairy products. The frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms was higher among the Crohn's disease patients who restricted dairy products than among those with no restrictions (100% vs 42.9%; p = 0.013); this result was not observed among the UC (ulcerative colitis) patients. Disease activity was also more frequent in the IBD patients who restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (23.8% vs 4.5%; p = 0.031), and among the UC patients, extensive disease was more common in the patients who restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (42.9% vs 20.0%; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Restricting dairy products is common among IBD patients, possibly due to disease activity, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the extension of the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Assessment of disease activity in UC is important for designing an optimal therapeutic strategy. No single histology score is considered optimum. The aim of this study was to compare intraobserver reproducibility and the interobserver agreement of available histological UC activity indexes. METHODS: One hundred and two biopsy specimens (collected between 2003 and 2014) were scored blindly by three pathologists by determining Geboes, Riley, Gramlich and Gupta indexes and global visual evaluation (GVE). Intraobserver reproducibility and interobserver agreements for index and items of index were studied by intraclass correlation coefficient for quantitative parameter and by kappa values and Krippendorff index for qualitative parameters. Relationship between indexes was studied by computation of Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Geboes, Riley, Gramlich and Gupta indexes and GVE showed good intraobserver reproducibility and a good interobserver agreement. Histological items that showed the best interobserver agreement were 'erosion/ulceration or surface epithelial integrity' and 'acute inflammatory cells infiltrate/neutrophils in lamina propria'. The five scores were strongly correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Correlation between indexes is strong. Intraobserver reproducibility and interobserver agreement for all indexes is very good. Histological items that showed the best interobserver agreement are 'erosion/ulceration' and 'acute inflammatory cells infiltrate/neutrophils in lamina propria'.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), namely Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are lifelong chronic disorders arising from interactions among genetic, immunological and environmental factors. Although the origin of IBDs is closely linked to immune response alterations, which governs most medical decision-making, recent findings suggest that gut microbiota may be involved in IBD pathogenesis. Epidemiologic evidence and several studies have shown that a dysregulation of gut microbiota (i.e., dysbiosis) may trigger the onset of intestinal disorders such as IBDs. Animal and human investigations focusing on the microbiota-IBD relationship have suggested an altered balance of the intestinal microbial population in the active phase of IBD. Rigorous microbiota typing could, therefore, soon become part of a complete phenotypic analysis of IBD patients. Moreover, individual susceptibility and environmental triggers such as nutrition, medications, age or smoking could modify bacterial strains in the bowel habitat. Pharmacological manipulation of bowel microbiota is somewhat controversial. The employment of antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics has been widely addressed in the literature worldwide, with the aim of obtaining positive results in a number of IBD patient settings, and determining the appropriate timing and modality of this intervention. Recently, novel treatments for IBDs, such as fecal microbiota transplantation, when accepted by patients, have shown promising results. Controlled studies are being designed. In the near future, new therapeutic strategies can be expected, with non-pathogenic or modified food organisms that can be genetically modified to exert anti-inflammatory properties.},

   abstract = {Surgery for inflammatory bowel disease under immunosuppressant drugs is a widely discussed topic. Because therapeutic concepts have significantly changed, almost no patient is currently without an immunosuppressant or biologic agent prior to surgery. However, the data whether biological agents and immunosuppressant are a risk factor are very inconsistent. Concerning Crohn's disease, monotherapy with immunosuppressants or biological agents seems to have no negative influence on the postoperative results. In contrast, however, for ulcerative colitis more publications recognise biologic agents and immunosuppressants as a single therapy as a risk factor for infections. To reduce the general risk, all risk factors have to be reduced. In Crohn's disease, nutritional status must be optimised, corticoids should be reduced, biological agents and immunosuppressant drugs should be stopped, protection of an eventual anastomosis by a stoma. For ulcerative colitis in high-risk patients, a three-stage restaurative proctocolectomy is favoured to a one- or two-staged proctocolectomy.},

We aimed to understand the underlying molecular pathways influencing these differences by analyzing three publically-available, independently-generated microarray datasets of gene expression from endoscopic biopsies of the colon. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that all three datasets share 87 gene sets upregulated in UC lesions and 8 gene sets downregulated (false discovery rate <0.05). The upregulated pathways were dominated by gene sets involved in immune function and signaling, as well as the control of mitosis. We applied pathway analysis to genotype data derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of UC, consisting of 5,584 cases and 11,587 controls assembled from eight European-ancestry cohorts. The upregulated pathways derived from the gene expression data showed a highly significant overlap with pathways derived from the genotype data (33 of 56 gene sets, hypergeometric P = 1.49 x 10(-19)). This study supports the hypothesis that heritable variation in gene expression as measured by GWAS signals can influence key pathways in the development of disease, and that comparison of genetic susceptibility loci with gene expression signatures can differentiate key drivers of inflammation from secondary effects on gene expression of the inflammatory process.},

The colitis damage score was determined using macroscopic and microscopic analyses. In addition, the antioxidant activity in serum and other tissues (liver and colon) was evaluated. Bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, aerobic bacteria and enterobacteria, and the amount of short-chain fatty acids (acetic, butyric, and propionic acids) in cecum content were counted. Differences in the colon damage scores were observed; P. edulis peel intake improved serum antioxidant status. In the treatment protocol, decreased colon lipid peroxidation, a decreased number of aerobic bacteria and enterobacteria, and an improvement in acetic and butyric acid levels in the feces were observed. An improvement in the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was observed in the prevention protocol. These results suggested that P. edulis peel can modulate microbiota and could be used as source of fiber and polyphenols in the prevention of oxidative stress through the improvement of serum and tissue antioxidant status.},

METHODS: A group of adolescents (ages 12-19) diagnosed as having IBD was administered a questionnaire listing 22 items of concern. They were asked to rank each item on a 5-point scale according to the degree of effect on the quality of their everyday life. The same questionnaire was administered to a group of paediatricians experienced in treating IBD and to a group of paediatric residents. Paediatricians and residents were asked to estimate how much each item would affect the quality of an average patient's life, according to the same scale. The questionnaire was also used in a face-to-face approach, asking a paediatrician to apply the estimation to an individual patient, instead of an average imaginary one. RESULTS: Fifteen paediatric gastroenterologists, 11 paediatric residents, and 28 patients (female:male = 16:12; median age 16.3 years) took part in the study. The majority of patients experienced Crohn disease (17 vs 11 with ulcerative colitis). We found only 6 items overlapping when comparing the top 10 items ranked by patients and paediatricians. The patients' number 1 concern occupies the ninth position in the paediatricians' list. The number 1 item for paediatricians is not even mentioned in the patients' top 10 list. Overall, both paediatricians' and residents' rankings were significantly higher than those given by patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant misalignment in the estimation of health concerns between IBD adolescent patients and their paediatricians. A better insight into IBD patients' worries and concerns is crucial for the improvement of the patient's quality of life and disease outcome.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection occurs increasingly in critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs). We reported CMV colitis which has rarely been recognized in the ICU patients. METHODS: CMV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for blood and/or stool samples. Definite diagnosis of CMV colitis required histopathology or CMV immunohistochemical staining of colorectal biopsies. We reviewed ICU patients characterized by positive blood or stool CMV-PCR with colorectal bleeding or water diarrhea. RESULTS: We identified 18 patients (biopsy-proved, n=8; probable cases, n=10). The most common comorbidities were chronic renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Stool CMV-PCR was positive in 7 of 10 patients (2 of 3 biopsy-proved and 5 of 7 probable cases). Colonoscopy was performed for 15 patients, revealing ulcerative or polypoid lesions. The endoscopists obtained colonic biopsies from 9 patients. Yet, the pathologists reported CMV colitis for 4 patients. Additional 4 patients were confirmed using immunohistochemical stain by the request of clinical physicians. Pseudomembranous colitis was found in 4 patients. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of CMV colitis seems difficult in clinical practice and need persistent communication between clinicians. The positive stool CMV-PCR result was a useful hint for adding immunohistochemical stain in mucosal biopsies to make a definite diagnosis of CMV colitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Obesity is associated with a proinflammatory state that may be involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), for which there are plausible biological mechanisms. Our aim was to perform the first prospective cohort study investigating if there is an association between obesity and the development of incident IBD. METHODS: A total of 300,724 participants were recruited into the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. At recruitment, anthropometric measurements of height and weight plus physical activity and total energy intake from validated questionnaires were recorded. The cohort was monitored identifying participants who developed either Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). Each case was matched with four controls and conditional logistic regression used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for body mass index (BMI) adjusted for smoking, energy intake, and physical activity. RESULTS: In the cohort, 177 participants developed incident UC and 75 participants developed incident CD. There were no associations with the four higher categories of BMI compared with a normal BMI for UC (Ptrend=0.36) or CD (Ptrend=0.83). The lack of associations was consistent when BMI was analyzed as a continuous or binary variable (BMI 18.5<25.0 vs. >/=25 kg/m(2)). Physical activity and total energy intake, factors that influence BMI, did not show any association with UC (physical activity, Ptrend=0.79; total energy intake, Ptrend=0.18) or CD (physical activity, Ptrend=0.42; total energy, Ptrend=0.11). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity as measured by BMI is not associated with the development of incident UC or CD. Alternative measures of obesity are required to further investigate the role of obesity in the development of incident IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet may have a role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. In previous studies, the associations between increased intakes of carbohydrates, sugar, starch, and inflammatory bowel disease are inconsistent. However, few prospective studies have investigated the associations between these macronutrients and incident Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: A total of 401,326 men and women were recruited between 1991 and 1998. At recruitment, dietary intakes of carbohydrate, sugar, and starch were measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored identifying participants who developed incident CD or UC. Cases were matched with 4 controls, and odds ratios were calculated for quintiles of total carbohydrate, sugar, and starch intakes adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, and smoking. RESULTS: One hundred ten participants developed CD, and 244 participants developed UC during follow-up. The adjusted odds ratio for the highest versus the lowest quintiles of total carbohydrate intake for CD was 0.87, 95% CI = 0.24 to 3.12 and for UC 1.46, 95% CI = 0.62 to 3.46, with no significant trends across quintiles for either (CD, P trend = 0.70; UC, P trend = 0.41). Similarly, no associations were observed with intakes of total sugar (CD, P trend = 0.50; UC, P trend = 0.71) or starch (CD, P trend = 0.69; UC, P trend = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of associations with these nutrients is in agreement with many case-control studies that have not identified associations with CD or UC. As there is biological plausibility for how specific carbohydrates could have an etiological role in inflammatory bowel disease, future epidemiological work should assess individual carbohydrates, although there does not seem to be a macronutrient effect.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a leading form of inflammatory bowel disease that involves chronic relapsing or progressive inflammation. As a significant proportion of UC patients treated with conventional therapies do not achieve remission, there is a pressing need for the development of more effective therapies. The human gut contains a large, diverse, and dynamic population of microorganisms, collectively referred to as the enteric microbiota. There is a symbiotic relationship between the human host and the enteric microbiota, which provides nutrition, protection against pathogenic organisms, and promotes immune homeostasis. An imbalance of the normal enteric microbiota composition (termed dysbiosis) underlies the pathogenesis of UC. A reduction of enteric microbiota diversity has been observed in UC patients, mainly affecting the butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which can repress pro-inflammatory cytokines. Many studies have shown that enteric microbiota plays an important role in anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory activities, which can benefit UC patients. Therefore, manipulation of the dysbiosis is an attractive approach for UC therapy. Various therapies targeting a restoration of the enteric microbiota have shown efficacy in treating patients with active and chronic forms of UC. Such therapies include fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, helminth therapy, and dietary polyphenols, all of which can alter the abundance and composition of the enteric microbiota. Although there have been many large, randomized controlled clinical trials assessing these treatments, the effectiveness and safety of these bacteria-driven therapies need further evaluation. This review focuses on the important role that the enteric microbiota plays in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and discusses new therapeutic strategies targeting the enteric microbiota for UC.},

   abstract = {Curcumin is a phytocompound found in the root of turmeric, a common herbal ingredient in many Asian cuisines. The compound contains anti-inflammatory activity, which is mediated through an up-regulation of adiponectin and reduction of leptin. Consumption of curcumin was shown to prevent some deteriorative conditions caused by inflammation, such as ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and esophagitis, and so on. Inflammation-associated cardiovascular conditions such as atherosclerosis are common in diabetes patients. The anti-inflammation effect of curcumin might be beneficial to prevent such condition in these patients. We aim to evaluate an antiatherosclerosis effect of curcumin in diabetes patients. Effects of curcumin on risk factors for atherosclerosis were investigated in a 6-month randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical trial that included subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. An atherosclerosis parameter, the pulse wave velocity, and other metabolic parameters in patients treated with placebo and curcumin were compared. Our results showed that curcumin intervention significantly reduced pulse wave velocity, increased level of serum adiponectin and decreased level of leptin. These results are associated with reduced levels of homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance, triglyceride, uric acid, visceral fat and total body fat. In summary, a 6-month curcumin intervention in type 2 diabetic population lowered the atherogenic risks. In addition, the extract helped to improve relevant metabolic profiles in this high-risk population.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was aimed to evaluate the frequency and course of adverse events associated with azathioprine treatment in Korean pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Total of 174 pediatric patients (age range, 1 to 19 years) with inflammatory bowel disease who received azathioprine in order to maintain remission at Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) from January 2002 through December 2012 were included in this study. Medical records of these subjects were retrospectively reviewed regarding the development of adverse events associated with azathioprine treatment. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (56.3%) of 174 patients experienced 136 episodes of adverse events, requiring dose reduction in 31 patients (17.8%), and discontinuation in 18 patients (10.3%). The mean dose of azathioprine that had been initially administered was 1.32+/-0.42 mg/kg/day. Among the adverse reactions, bone marrow suppression developed in 47 patients (27.0%), requiring dose reduction in 22 patients (12.6%) and discontinuation in 8 patients (4.6%). Other adverse events that occurred were gastrointestinal disturbance (15.5%), hair loss (12.1%), pancreatitis (7.5%), arthralgia (6.9%), hepatotoxicity (2.9%), skin rash/allergic reactions (2.9%), headache/dizziness (2.3%), sepsis (0.6%), and oral mucositis (0.6%). CONCLUSION: Bone marrow suppression, especially leukopenia was most commonly associated with azathioprine treatment in Korean pediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients. Close observation for possible adverse events is required in this population with inflammatory bowel diseases who are under treatment with azathioprine.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and often attributed to inflammation. However, many patients with inflammatory bowel disease without evidence of active disease continue to experience pain. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of pain in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and examine the role of inflammation and psychiatric comorbidities in patients with UC with pain. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of adult patients with UC seen at a tertiary referral inflammatory bowel disease center. Age, gender, disease duration and extent, abdominal pain rating, quality of life, physician global assessment, endoscopic and histological rating of disease severity, C reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were abstracted. RESULTS: A total of 1268 patients were identified using billing codes for colitis. Five hundred and two patients (48.2% women) met all inclusion criteria. Two hundred and sixty-two individuals (52.2%) complained of abdominal pain, with 108 individuals (21.5%) describing more frequent pain ("some of the time or more"). Of those with quiescent disease (n = 326), 33 patients (10%) complained of more frequent pain. Physician global assessment, endoscopic and histological severity rating, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C reactive protein significantly correlated with pain ratings. The best predictors of pain were physician global assessment, C reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, female gender, and coexisting mood disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal pain affects more than 50% of patients with UC. Although inflammation is important, the skewed gender distribution and correlation with mood disorders highlight parallels with functional bowel disorders and suggest a significant role for central mechanisms. Management strategies should thus go beyond a focus on inflammation and also include interventions that target psychological mechanisms of pain.},

   abstract = {Accurate and high-throughput technologies are needed for identification of new therapeutic targets and for optimizing therapy in inflammatory bowel disease. Our aim was to assess multi-analyte protein-based assays of cytokines/chemokines using Luminex technology. We have reported that Luminex-based profiling was useful in assessing response to L-arginine therapy in the mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium colitis. Therefore, we studied prospectively collected samples from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and control subjects. Serum, colon biopsies, and clinical information were obtained from subjects undergoing colonoscopy for evaluation of UC or for non-UC indications. In total, 38 normal controls and 137 UC cases completed the study. Histologic disease severity and the Mayo Disease Activity Index (DAI) were assessed. Serum and colonic tissue cytokine/chemokine profiles were measured by Luminex-based multiplex testing of 42 analytes. Only eotaxin-1 and G-CSF were increased in serum of patients with histologically active UC vs. controls. While 13 cytokines/chemokines were increased in active UC vs. controls in tissues, only eotaxin-1 was increased in all levels of active disease in both serum and tissue. In tissues, eotaxin-1 correlated with the DAI and with eosinophil counts. Increased eotaxin-1 levels were confirmed by real-time PCR. Tissue eotaxin-1 levels were also increased in experimental murine colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium, oxazolone, or Citrobacter rodentium, but not in murine Helicobacter pylori infection. Our data implicate eotaxin-1 as an etiologic factor and therapeutic target in UC, and indicate that Luminex-based assays may be useful to assess IBD pathogenesis and to select patients for anti-cytokine/chemokine therapies.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory disorder that affects the colonic mucosa. One class among the drugs used for its treatment is the 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs). While highly efficacious in treating mild-to-moderate UC, 5-ASAs are associated with rare but potentially life-threatening side effects such as pericarditis, myocarditis and pneumonitis. These adverse events appear to be caused by a hypersensitivity reaction and resolve after cessation of 5-ASA drugs. This article presents a case report of febrile pleuropericarditis in a UC patient treated with balsalazide, and provides a thorough literature review of the rare side effects of 5-ASAs, their incidence, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis and treatment. In conclusion, the clinicians should be aware that this type of adverse events to 5-ASA compounds can be easily overlooked but it has significant morbidity if not promptly diagnosed.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Accurate assessment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) activity is the cornerstone of effective therapy. Fecal M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) and fecal calprotectin (FC) are noninvasive markers of mucosal inflammation in IBD. The aim of this study was to compare performance of M2-PK and FC in assessment of pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) severity and activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 121 patients with IBD, including 75 with UC and 46 with CD were recruited. Control group consisted of 35 healthy children (HS). Patients were assigned to groups depending on disease severity and activity. M2-PK and calprotectin concentration were determined in stool samples using ELISA. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for FC and M2-PK with cut-off level at which M2-PK specificity was matching FC specificity were calculated and compared. RESULTS: Performance of M2-PK at identifying patients with IBD, UC and CD among HS was inferior to FC. The differences in AUC were respectively: -0.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.13-(-0.06)], p<0.0001), -0.14 (95% CI [-0.19-(-0.09)], p<0.0001) and -0.03 (95% CI [-0.05-(-0.001)], p<0.02). M2-PK was inferior to FC in discriminating patients with mild UC from those with HS (AUC difference -0.23, 95% CI [-0.31-(-0.15)], p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: FC reflects pediatric IBD severity and activity better than M2-PK. This difference is particularly pronounced when identifying patients with mild UC and UC in remission.},

   abstract = {Many patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are undergoing therapy with infliximab, an antibody specific for TNF. However, the exact mechanisms of action of infliximab are not completely understood. The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro effects of infliximab on blood T cells derived from anti-TNF therapy-naive ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with clinically active disease. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated polyclonally or by antigen in the presence or absence of infliximab. The T cell phenotype was investigated by flow cytometry, cytokine secretion was determined by ELISA, and cell proliferation was determined by thymidine assay or CFSE dye. Presence of infliximab resulted in reduced expression of CD25 in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell populations and inhibited secretion of IFN-gamma, IL-13, IL-17A, TNF as well as granzyme A. Infliximab also suppressed CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell proliferation. These effects of infliximab were recorded both in T cells activated by polyclonal and antigen-specific stimulation. The effects of infliximab on T cell apoptosis and induction of FOXP3(+) CD4(+) T regulatory cells were ambiguous and depended on the originating cellular source and/or the stimulation mode and strength. In conclusion, infliximab is able to reduce T cell activation as measured by CD25, proliferation and cytokine secretion in vitro from UC patients with clinically active disease. These data suggest that suppression of T cell activity may be important for infliximab-mediated disease remission in patients with UC.},

METHODS: Children from 3 centers, who had received IFX for UC, were identified, and patient charts were reviewed retrospectively. Data concerning symptoms, biochemistry, concomitant medical treatment, colectomy, and adverse events were registered. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients with UC (median age at diagnosis 12 years, interquartile range 10-14) were included, and studied for a median of 15 months (interquartile range 4.5-29) after first IFX infusion. The cumulative 1- and 2-year risks of colectomy were 21% and 26%, respectively. The cumulative 1- and 2-year risks of receiving a new course of systemic corticosteroids were 32% and 48%, respectively. Twenty-one patients (46%) experienced adverse events. Most common were mild infusion reactions, but 3 (7%) had serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: IFX was efficient in preventing colectomy in children with UC. The risk of receiving systemic corticosteroids was lower than that reported in other studies. Most adverse events were mild to moderate and self-limiting.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammation during inflammatory bowel disease may alter nutrient availability to adherent mucosal bacteria and impact their metabolic function. Microbial metabolites may regulate intestinal CD4 T-cell homeostasis. We investigated the relationship between inflammation and microbial function by inferred metagenomics of the mucosal microbiota from colonic pinch biopsies of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Paired pinch biopsy samples of known inflammation states were analyzed from ulcerative colitis (UC) (23), Crohn's disease (CD) (21), and control (24) subjects by 16S ribosomal sequencing, histopathologic assessment, and flow cytometry. PICRUSt was used to generate metagenomic data and derive relative Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway abundance information. Leukocytes were isolated from paired biopsy samples and analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry. Active inflammation was defined by neutrophil infiltration into the epithelium. RESULTS: Carriage of metabolic pathways in the mucosal microbiota was relatively stable among patients with inflammatory bowel disease, despite large variations in individual bacterial community structures. However, microbial function was significantly altered in inflamed tissue of UC patients, with a reduction in carbohydrate and nucleotide metabolism in favor of increased lipid and amino acid metabolism. These differences were not observed in samples from CD patients. In CD, microbial lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism tightly correlated with the frequency of CD4Foxp3 Tregs, whereas in UC, these pathways correlated with the frequency of CD4IL-22 (TH22) cells. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic pathways of the mucosal microbiota in CD do not vary as much as UC with inflammation state, indicating a more systemic perturbation of host-bacteria interactions in CD compared with more localized dysfunction in UC.},

Within the past few decades, fecal infusion either rectally or via a nasogastric tube has become a viable option for the treatment of refractory Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and, more recently, it has shown promise in treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and metabolic disease. The purpose of this article is to review the use of feces as a treatment option in pediatric disease. RECENT FINDINGS: The majority of publications detailing the use of fecal infusion as a medical treatment have been case reports. In the first randomized controlled trial of its kind, fecal infusion via nasogastric tube was shown to be beneficial in treating refractory CDI in adults. In another first of its kind, a pilot study on the use of fecal enemas to treat ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients found it to be well tolerated and effective. SUMMARY: The infusion of feces into the intestinal tract shows great promise for treatment and modulation of a variety of intestinal and extraintestinal diseases. Defining the underlying mechanism, microbes, and metabolites that mediate this effect will lead to more directed, safer, and potentially more effective treatments.},

While the development of the immune system and the establishment of the microflora take place during infancy young patients often have a more severe and extensive disease. The differences in composition and concentration of intestinal microbiota and aberrant immune responses towards the luminal bacteria prompted the concept of an 'ecological' approach to control the disease course. Probiotics, living, non pathogenic micro organisms with a beneficial effect on the host, and prebiotics, oligosaccharides promoting the growth of the beneficial microflora, have been studied to this effect. Results have so far been disappointing for Crohn's disease but encouraging for ulcerative colitis. An overview of studies using probiotics in adults or children and a perspective on specific pediatric issues is provided in this review.},

At the same period, 148 patients with IBD according to the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition criteria were followed up at the Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit in our University Hospital. Only two of them had vasculitis, as an extra intestinal manifestation of UC mimicking HSP, and fulfilled both disease criteria. A 2-year old girl had bloody diarrhoea, severe abdominal pain, arthritis in ankles, petechiae and palpable purpura not related to thrombocytopenia in lower limbs. A 5-year old boy had bloody diarrhoea, palpable purpura in buttocks, lower limbs, penis and scrotum associated with arthritis in knees, orchitis in right testicle and periarticular swelling in hands and feet. Their ileocolonoscopy showed diffuse mucosal erythema, oedema, friability and multiple irregular ulcers, and histopathological examination of colonic specimen revealed diffuse chronic mucosal inflammation, crypt distortion and crypt abscesses suggesting ulcerative colitis. There were no signs of intestinal vasculitis in both cases. In conclusion, this is the first study in a paediatric population that evidenced palpable purpura associated with UC mimicking HSP.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacteria play a role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in IBD. Compositional alterations may also change the metabolic capacities of the gut bacteria. OBJECTIVE: To examine the metabolic activity of the microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), UC or pouchitis compared with healthy controls (HC) and determine whether eventual differences might be related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained from 40 HC, 83 patients with CD, 68 with UC and 13 with pouchitis. Disease activity was assessed in CD using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, in UC using the UC Disease Activity Index and in pouchitis using the Pouchitis Disease Activity Index. Metabolite profiles were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of metabolites identified in HC (54) was significantly higher than in patients with CD (44, p<0.001), UC (47, p=0.042) and pouchitis (43, p=0.036). Multivariate discriminant analysis predicted HC, CD, UC and pouchitis group membership with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs: pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate and nonanoate), and of some protein fermentation metabolites, were significantly decreased in patients with CD, UC and pouchitis. Hexanoate levels were inversely correlated to disease activity in CD (correlation coefficient=-0.157, p=0.046), whereas a significant positive correlation was found between styrene levels and disease activity in UC (correlation coefficient=0.338, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Faecal metabolic profiling in patients with IBD relative to healthy controls identified MCFAs as important metabolic biomarkers of disease-related changes.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The combination of the severity of pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) phenotypes and the need for intense medical treatment may increase the risk of malignancy and mortality, but evidence regarding the extent of the problem is scarce. Therefore, the Porto Pediatric IBD working group of ESPGHAN conducted a multinational-based survey of cancer and mortality in pediatric IBD. METHODS: A survey among pediatric gastroenterologists of 20 European countries and Israel on cancer and/or mortality in the pediatric patient population with IBD was undertaken. One representative from each country repeatedly contacted all pediatric gastroenterologists from each country for reporting retrospectively cancer and/or mortality of pediatric patients with IBD after IBD onset, during 2006-2011. RESULTS: We identified 18 cases of cancers and/or 31 deaths in 44 children (26 males) who were diagnosed with IBD (ulcerative colitis, n = 21) at a median age of 10.0 years (inter quartile range, 3.0-14.0). Causes of mortality were infectious (n = 14), cancer (n = 5), uncontrolled disease activity of IBD (n = 4), procedure-related (n = 3), other non-IBD related diseases (n = 3), and unknown (n = 2). The most common malignancies were hematopoietic tumors (n = 11), of which 3 were hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and 3 Ebstein-Barr virus-associated lymphomas. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer and mortality in pediatric IBD are rare, but cumulative rates are not insignificant. Mortality is primarily related to infections, particularly in patients with 2 or more immunosuppressive agents, followed by cancer and uncontrolled disease. At least 6 lymphomas were likely treatment-associated by virtue of their phenotype.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Dietary fatty acids may be involved in the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). Arachidonic acid (AA), an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is a precursor of the proinflammatory cytokines prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4, and its metabolism is competitively inhibited by oleic acid (OA). This study aimed to prospectively investigate whether AA is positively and OA is negatively associated with incident UC development, using data from 7-day food diaries. METHODS: A total of 25 639 men and women, aged between 40 and 79 years, from Norfolk, UK, were recruited into the prospective European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort between 1993 and 1997. At baseline, participants completed 7-day food diaries, checked by nutritionists using a database containing 11 000 foods and 55 000 portion sizes. The cohort was monitored until June 2004 to identify participants who developed UC. Each patient was matched for age and sex with four controls, and conditional logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios for AA and OA intakes, and UC association. RESULTS: Of the participants, 26 (58% men) developed incident UC (53% left sided) after a median follow-up time of 3.8 years (0.5-8.3 years). The highest AA tertile was positively associated with an odds ratio of 6.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-35.23], with a trend across tertiles [odds ratio (OR) 2.43, 95% CI 1.06-5.61, P=0.04]. The highest tertile of OA intake was inversely associated with a 0.03 OR for UC (95% CI 0.002-0.56) and an inverse trend (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.90, P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Dietary AA was positively and OA was inversely associated with UC development, with large effect sizes in a dose-dependent manner. This supports roles for measuring these nutrients in future etiological studies and modifying intake in future interventional studies in patients with established disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that includes both Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis. Abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and weight loss characterize both CD and ulcerative colitis. The incidence of IBD in the United States is 70 to 150 cases per 100,000 individuals and, as with other autoimmune diseases, is on the rise. CD can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus and frequently will include perianal disease. The first description connecting regional enteritis with perianal disease was by Bissell et al in 1934, and since that time perianal disease has become a recognized entity and an important consideration in the diagnosis and treatment of CD. Perianal Crohn disease (PCD) is defined as inflammation at or near the anus, including tags, fissures, fistulae, abscesses, or stenosis. The symptoms of PCD include pain, itching, bleeding, purulent discharge, and incontinence of stool. In this report, we review and discuss the etiology, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of PCD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We undertook a study to test the hypothesis that inflammation alters peripheral sensory mechanisms, thereby contributing to chronic abdominal pain in ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Patients with UC and healthy individuals rated abdominal pain using a visual analog scale and completed surveys describing anxiety or depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score) and gastrointestinal symptoms (Rome III questionnaire). Patient age, sex, and severity of inflammation were determined. Rectal biopsies were processed using immunohistochemical techniques to assess nerve fiber density and real-time PCR to determine transcript expression of neurotrophins (nerve growth factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, artemin, neurturin), ion channels (transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1, transient receptor potential ankyrin 1) and inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17). RESULTS: A total of 77 patients with UC (27 female, 50 male) and 21 controls (10 female, 11 male) were enrolled. Patients with UC with pain had significantly higher depression scores than controls and patients with UC without pain (P < 0.05). There was no correlation between any of the inflammatory markers and pain scores. Visual analog scale pain scores significantly correlated with younger age, higher depression scores, increased expression of neurturin and decreased expression of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 in the mucosa. Mucosal nerve fiber density did not correlate with any measures of inflammation or pain. Only higher depression scores independently predicted pain in UC (r > 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe changes in mucosal innervation and did not see a significant relationship between nerve fiber density, inflammatory mediators, neurotrophic factors, or mucosal ion channel expression and pain. In contrast, the importance of depression as the only independent predictor of pain ratings mirrors functional disorders, where central processes significantly contribute to symptom development and/or perpetuation.},

Using multiple, overlapping search strategies followed by a detailed records review, we identified all cases of pediatric PSC, ASC, AIH, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a geographically isolated region of the United States. We identified 607 cases of IBD, 29 cases of PSC, 12 cases of ASC, and 44 cases of AIH. The mean age at diagnosis was 13.0 years for PSC, 11.3 years for ASC, and 9.8 years for AIH. The incidence and prevalence of PSC, ASC, and AIH were 0.2 and 1.5 cases, 0.1 and 0.6 cases, and 0.4 and 3.0 cases per 100,000 children, respectively. The mean duration of follow-up was 5.9 years. The probability of developing complicated liver disease within 5 years of the diagnosis of liver disease was 37% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 21%-58%] for PSC, 25% (95% CI = 7%-70%) for ASC, and 15% (95% CI = 7%-33%) for AIH. The 5-year survival rates with the native liver were 78% (95% CI = 54%-91%) for PSC, 90% (95% CI = 47%-99%) for ASC, and 87% (95% CI = 71%-95%) for AIH. Cholangiocarcinoma developed in 2 of the 29 PSC patients (6.9%). PSC occurred in 9.9% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and in 0.6% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). ASC occurred in 2.3% of UC patients and 0.9% of CD patients. AIH occurred in 0.4% of UC patients and in 0.3% of CD patients. Liver disease occurred in 39 of 607 IBD patients (6.4%) overall. CONCLUSION: Immune-mediated liver diseases are important sources of morbidity in children. Using a population-based design, this study quantifies the burden and natural history of immune-mediated liver disease in children.},

The pathogenic mechanisms of the thrombotic events are not fully understood. We investigated levels of circulating microparticles and their influence on thrombin generation in pediatric patients with IBD during active and quiescent disease compared with healthy controls. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 33 pediatric patients with Crohn disease (CD), 20 pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 60 healthy controls. Microparticles' procoagulant activity was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the dependency of thrombin generation on microparticles-derived tissue factor was determined by means of calibrated automated thrombography. RESULTS: The procoagulant function of microparticles was significantly increased in patients with active and inactive CD, and active UC compared with controls. Endogenous thrombin potential was significantly higher in patients with CD and UC compared with controls. A minor influence of microparticles on thrombin generation was only observed for patients with active UC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows increased procoagulant function of microparticles in pediatric patients with active and quiescent CD and active UC compared with controls, but demonstrates that they are not a major cause for the higher thrombin generation in pediatric patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {Due to the intestinal inflammation, tissue damage, and painful abdominal symptoms restricting dietary intake associated with both diseases, patients with intestinal pelvic radiation disease (PRD) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk to develop protein calorie malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. In the current paper, we review the nutritional management of both diseases, listing the similar approaches of nutritional management and the nutritional implications of intestinal dysfunction of both diseases. Malnutrition is prevalent in patients with either disease and nutritional risk screening and assessment of nutritional status are required for designing the proper nutritional intervention plan. This plan may include dietary management, oral nutritional supplementation, and enteral and/or parenteral nutrition. In addition to managing malnutrition, nutrients exert immune modulating effects during periods of intestinal inflammation and can play a role in mitigating the risks associated with the disease activity. Consistently, exclusive enteral feeding is recommended for inducing remission in pediatric patients with active Crohn's disease, with less clear guidelines on use in patients with ulcerative colitis. The field of immune modulating nutrition is an evolving science that takes into consideration the specific mechanism of action of nutrients, nutrient-nutrient interaction, and preexisting nutritional status of the patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The NOS2 gene encodes for the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), responsible for nitric oxide (NO) production, which contributes to antimicrobial and antipathogenic activities. Higher levels of both iNOS and NO-induced damage have been observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. NOS2 may have a role in a specific subset of IBD patients with severe and/or extensive colitis. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the role of NOS2 in such a subset, very early onset IBD (VEO-IBD). METHODS: Seventeen tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NOS2 gene were successfully genotyped in VEO-IBD patients. Genetic associations were replicated in an independent VEO-IBD cohort. Functional analysis for iNOS activity was performed on the most significantly associated functional variant. RESULTS: The NOS2 rs2297518 SNP was found to be associated in VEO-IBD in two independent cohorts. Upon combined analysis, a coding variant (S608L) showed the strongest association with VEO-IBD (Pcombined=1.13 x 10(-6), OR (odds ratio)=3.398 (95% CI (confidence interval) 2.02-5.717)) as well as associations with VEO-Crohn's disease and VEO-ulcerative colitis (UC). This variant also showed an association with UC diagnosed between 11 and 17 years of age but not with adult-onset IBD (>17 years). B-cell lymphoblastoid cell lines genotyped for the risk variant as well as Henle-407 cells transfected with a plasmid construct with the risk variant showed higher NO production. Colonic biopsies of VEO-IBD patients showed higher immunohistochemical staining of nitrotyrosine, indicating more nitrosative stress and tissue damage. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest the importance of iNOS in genetic susceptibility to younger IBD presentation due to higher NO production.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Acute severe exacerbations of Ulcerative Colitis (UC) represent a medical emergency in children and adults. Intravenous steroids remain the first line therapy for this condition, although the steroid refractoriness is common. Second-line therapy, based on the infliximab or thiopurines should be started if no response to corticosteroids is noted. The use of infliximab in children with acute severe UC, nevertheless, does not avoid the colectomy in all cases. METHODS: We present a case of severe acute UC in a paediatric patient successfully treated with thalidomide following the failed treatment with infliximab and a review of the literature. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case of a patient presenting with acute severe UC who was treated with thalidomide, with favorable evolution. In our case the use of this drug was able to avoid the colectomy that represent the conventional but very invasive recommended therapeutic option of this condition. Therefore, thalidomide may be considered as rescue therapy in selected and carefully monitored cases of acute severe CU.},

   abstract = {Isorhamnetin is an O-methylated flavonol present in fruit and vegetables. We recently reported the identification of isorhamnetin as an activator of the human pregnane X receptor (PXR), a known target for abrogating inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The current study investigated the role of isorhamnetin as a putative mouse PXR activator in ameliorating chemically induced IBD. Using two different models (ulcerative colitis like and Crohn's disease like) of experimental IBD in mice, we demonstrated that isorhamnetin abrogated inflammation through inhibiting the activity of myeloperoxidase, the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6, the mRNA expression of proinflammatory mediators (iNOS, ICAM-1, COX2, TNF-alpha, IL-2 and IL-6) and the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and NF-kappaB p65. PXR gene overexpression inhibited NF-kappaB luciferase activity, and the inhibition was potentiated by isorhamnetin treatment. PXR knockdown by siRNA demonstrated the necessity for PXR in isorhamnetin-mediated up-regulation of xenobiotic metabolism genes. Ligand pocket-filling mutants (S247W/C284W and S247W/C284W/S208W) of human PXR weakened the effect of isorhamnetin on PXR activation. Molecular docking studies and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer competitive binding assays confirmed the ligand (isorhamnetin)-binding affinity. These results clearly demonstrated the ameliorating effect of isorhamnetin on experimental IBD via PXR-mediated up-regulation of xenobiotic metabolism and down-regulation of NF-kappaB signaling. The novel findings may contribute to the effective utilization of isorhamnetin or its derivatives as a PXR ligand in the treatment of human IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Green tea and its main polyphenolic component, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), exert powerful anti-inflammatory effects that are protective against both inflammatory diseases and cancer. Research with animal and human cell lines provide plausible support for these claims. Poor absorption results in low systemic bioavailability of EGCG after oral administration but high colonic mucosal exposure. METHODS: Patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) were randomized to daily doses of oral Polyphenon E (400 mg or 800 mg of total EGCG daily, administered in split doses) or placebo in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study. Response was measured by the UC disease activity index and the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire on day 56. RESULTS: Twenty patients were randomized to active therapy or placebo in a 4:1 ratio. Nineteen subjects received >1 dose of study medication (15 Polyphenon E, 4 placebo). The mean UC disease activity index score at study entry was 6.5 +/- 1.9 in the treatment group and 7.3 +/- 1.7 in the placebo group. After 56 days of therapy, the response rate was 66.7% (10 of 15) in the Polyphenon E group and 0% (0 of 4) in the placebo group (P = 0.03). The active treatment remission rate was 53.3% (8 of 15) compared with 0% (0 of 4) for placebo (P = 0.10). Polyphenon E treatment resulted in only minor side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of Polyphenon E resulted in a therapeutic benefit for patients who were refractory to 5-aminosalicylic and/or azathioprine. This agent holds promise as a novel option for the treatment of patients with UC with mild to moderately active disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alkaline sphingomyelinase (NPP7) is an ecto-enzyme expressed in intestinal mucosa, which hydrolyses sphingomyelin (SM) to ceramide and inactivates platelet activating factor. It is also expressed in human liver and released in the bile. The enzyme may have anti-tumour and anti-inflammatory effects in colon and its levels are decreased in patients with colon cancer and ulcerative colitis. Active NPP7 is translated from a transcript of 1.4 kb, whereas an inactive form from a 1.2 kb mRNA was found in colon and liver cancer cell lines. While the roles of NPP7 in colon cancer have been intensively studied, less is known about the function and implications of NPP7 in the bile. The present study examines the changes of NPP7 in bile of patients with various hepatobiliary diseases. METHODS: Bile samples were obtained at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in 59 patients with gallstone, other benign disease, tumour, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The NPP7 activity was determined. The appearance of the 1.4 and 1.2 kb products in the bile was examined by Western blot. The results were correlated to the diseases and also plasma bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. RESULTS: NPP7 activity in the tumour group was significantly lower than in the gallstone group (p < 0.05). The activity in the tumour plus PSC group was also lower than in gallstone plus other benign disease group (p < 0.05). Within the tumour group NPP7 activity was lowest in cholangiocarcinoma patients, being only 19% of that in gallstone patients. Bilirubin correlated inversely to NPP7 and was higher in the tumour than in the gallstone group. Western blot identified both the 1.4 kb and the 1.2 kb products in most bile samples. The density ratio for the 1.4/1.2 kb products correlated to NPP7 activity significantly. Two patients (one PSC and one cholangiocarcinoma) lacking NPP7 activity had only the 1.2 kb form in bile. CONCLUSION: NPP7 activity and the ratio of 1.4/1.2 kb products in bile are significantly decreased in malignancy, particularly in cholangiocarcinoma. The implications of the finding in diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma and 1.2 kb product in hepatobiliary diseases require further investigation.},

   abstract = {Probiotic microorganisms have historically been used to rebalance disturbed intestinal microbiota and to diminish gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhea or inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). Recent studies explore the potential for expanded uses of probiotics on medical disorders that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, such as obesity, hypercholesterolemia, arterial hypertension, and metabolic disturbances such as hyperhomocysteinemia and oxidative stress. This review aims at summarizing the proposed molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in probiotic-host interactions and to identify the nature of the resulting beneficial effects. Specific probiotic strains can act by modulating immune response, by producing particular molecules or releasing biopeptides, and by modulating nervous system activity. To date, the majority of studies have been conducted in animal models. New investigations on the related mechanisms in humans need to be carried out to better enable targeted and effective use of the broad variety of probiotic strains.},

   abstract = {The influence of genetics in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was initially demonstrated by epidemiological data, including differences in prevalence among different ethnic groups, familial aggregation of IBD, concordance in twins, and association with genetic syndromes. These early observations paved the way to molecular genetics in IBD, and culminated in the identification of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) gene as an IBD risk gene in 2001. As in other complex diseases, the advent of Genome Wide Association studies has dramatically improved the resolution of the IBD genome and our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD. However, the complexity of the genetic puzzle in IBD seems more pronounced today than ever previously. In total, 163 risk genes/loci have been identified, and the corresponding number of possible causal variants is challenging. The great majority of these loci are associated with both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, suggesting that nearly all of the biological mechanisms involved in one disease play some role in the other. Interestingly, a large proportion of the IBD risk loci are also shared with other immune-mediated diseases, primary immunodeficiencies and mycobacterial diseases.},

METHODS: Review of the medical records of children with a final diagnosis of IBD to determine age, sex, and type of IBD, supplemented by information on consanguinity and family history (FH) of IBD in relatives. There were 138 children, ages 1.4 to 19.3 years, and 50% were girls. RESULTS: The prevalence of consanguinity was 50%, 53%, 39% and 60% in IBD, Crohn disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and controls, respectively. There was a significantly higher prevalence of consanguinity in controls than in patients with IBD and UC (P = 0.02 and 0.026, respectively), whereas the difference between CD patients and controls was not significant (P = 0.20). The prevalence of first cousin consanguinity was 71%, 73.2%, 61.5% and 70.5% in patients with IBD, CD, UC, and controls, respectively, indicating no significant difference between these conditions and controls (P = 0.95, P = 0.78, P = 0.33, respectively). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of consanguinity in the parents of children with or without a FH of either CD (P = 0.89) or UC (P = 0.32). CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant relation between parental consanguinity and IBD in this population, especially when there is no FH of disease, suggesting reduced genetic susceptibility; however, further studies including larger sample size and details of FH of consanguinity and IBD in multiple generations are needed for further definitions of the role of consanguinity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mucosa-associated Escherichia coli are abundant in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but whether these bacteria gain intracellular access within the mucosa is uncertain. If E. coli does gain intracellular access, the contribution of bacterial pathogenicity to this requires further elucidation. This study aimed to quantify and characterize mucosa-associated and intracellular E. coli in patients with IBD and in healthy control subjects (HC). METHODS: Mucosal biopsies from 30 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 15 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 14 HC were cultured with or without gentamicin protection to recover intracellular or mucosa-associated E. coli, respectively. Overall, 40 strains (CD: n = 24, UC: n = 9, and HC: n = 7) were characterized by phylogenetic typing, adhesion and invasion assays, detection of virulence factors, antimicrobial resistance genes, and proteomic analysis. RESULTS: Mucosa-associated E. coli were more abundant in CD and UC than in HC (2750 versus 1350 versus 230 median colony-forming units per biopsy; P = 0.01). Intracellular E. coli were more prevalent in CD (90%) than in UC (47%) or HC mucosal biopsies (0%) (P < 0.001). Of 24 CD strains, 2 were adherent and invasive, but there were no unifying pathogenicity determinants that could distinguish most CD strains from UC or HC strains, or intracellular isolates from mucosa-associated isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Intracellular E. coli are more common in CD than in UC and not identified in HC. Most intracellular E. coli did not have characterizing pathogenic features, suggesting a significant role for defects in mucosal immunity or barrier dysfunction in their ability to gain intracellular access.},

METHODS: From January 1, 1978, to December 31, 2007, the sex- and age-adjusted annual incidence and prevalence of pediatric IBD per 100,000 population were calculated based on the pediatric IBD database of the only pediatric tertiary center in the province. The annual health statistics records for the Province of Manitoba were used to calculate population estimates for the participants. To ensure validity of data, the University of Manitoba IBD Epidemiology Database was analyzed for patients <17 years of age from 1989 to 2000. RESULTS: The sex- and age-adjusted incidence of pediatric Crohn disease has increased from 1.2/100,000 in 1978 to 4.68/100,000 in 2007 (P < 0.001). For ulcerative colitis, the incidence has increased from 0.47/100,000 in 1978 to 1.64/100,000 in 2007 (P < 0.001). During the same time period, the prevalence of Crohn disease has increased from 3.1 to 18.9/100,000 (P < 0.001) and from 0.7 to 12.7/100,000 for ulcerative colitis (P < 0.001). During the last 5 years of the study the average annual incidence of IBD in urban patients was 8.69/100,000 as compared with 4.75/100,000 for rural patients (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and prevalence of pediatric IBD are increasing. The majority of patients were residents of urban Manitoba, confirming the important role of environmental factors in the etiopathogenesis of IBD.},

METHODS: Forty-six patients were randomly allocated into GBF group and control group. Subjects in control group received only conventional drug therapy, while the GBF group received 30g GBF per day (3 times a day) by oral administration during 2 month along with routine medications. RESULTS: The mean serum CRP in the GBF group decreased significantly (P=0.017) compared with the baseline. Although the frequency of clinical signs including the number of episodes diarrhea, degree of visible blood in stool, degree of abdominal pain or cramping, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia decreased in the GBF group but it was statistically significant only in the case of abdominal pain and cramping. However, this reduction was only significant in the case of abdominal pain and cramping (P=0.016) CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of GBF along with the current medication may be efficient in attenuating the inflammation and clinical signs of UC patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although randomized trials demonstrated the efficacy of infliximab for both pediatric Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), few patients in these studies exhibited colitis requiring hospitalization. The aims of this study were to determine the rate of subsequent infliximab failure and dose escalation in pediatric patients who started taking infliximab during hospitalization for colitis-predominant IBD, and to identify potential predictors of these endpoints. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients admitted from 2005 to 2010 with Crohn colitis, UC, or IBD-unspecified (IBD-U) and initiated on infliximab. RESULTS: We identified 29 patients (12 Crohn colitis, 15 UC, and 2 IBD-U; median age 14 years) with a median follow-up of 923 days. Eighteen patients (62%) required infliximab dose escalation (increased dose or decreased infusion interval). Infliximab failure occurred in 18 patients (62%) because of ineffectiveness in 12 (67%) and adverse reactions in 6 (33%). Twelve patients (41%) underwent colectomy. Subsequent need for infliximab dose escalation was associated with lower body mass index z score (P = 0.01), lower serum albumin (P = 0.03), and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P = 0.002) at baseline. ESR predicted subsequent infliximab dose escalation with an area under the curve of 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-1.00) and a sensitivity and specificity at a cutoff of 38 mm/hour of 0.79 (95% CI 0.49-0.95) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.47-0.99), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most hospitalized pediatric patients with colitis treated with infliximab require early-dose escalation and fail the drug long term. Low body mass index and albumin and high ESR, may identify patients who would benefit from a higher infliximab starting dose.},

Both types of inflammatory bowel disease have a complex etiology, resulting from a genetically determined susceptibility interacting with environmental factors, including the diet and gut microbiota. Genome Wide Association Studies have implicated more than 160 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in disease susceptibility. Consideration of the different pathways suggested to be involved implies that specific dietary interventions are likely to be appropriate, dependent upon the nature of the genes involved. Epigenetics and the gut microbiota are also responsive to dietary interventions. Nutrigenetics may lead to personalized nutrition for disease prevention and treatment, while nutrigenomics may help to understand the nature of the disease and individual response to nutrients.},

Malnutrition should be assessed in case of IBD (in 20 - 70 % of Crohn's patients) and weight loss(> 5 % within 3 months) or nutritional deficiencies or after extensive bowel resection and afterwards also treated. Malnutrition should be treated with medical therapy of IBD and also adequate - as far as possible - with oral nutritional therapy particularly because of reduced life quality, risk of opportunistic infections, osteopenia/osteoporosis, longer hospitalisations and higher mortality. Iron homeostasis, serum levels of Vitamin B12- and folic acid, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and zinc should be checked. Therapy with enteral liquid diets is only indicated as therapy of first choice in children and adolescents, but only in rare situations in adults with IBD. There is - up to now - no proven oral diet for maintenance of remission in IBD. Probiotics as E. coli Nissle could be used as alternative to mesalazine for maintenance of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. A specific dietary counselling is mandatory in patients with ileostoma or short bowel syndrome. Malnutrition of short bowel patients is particularly dependent on the function and length of the remaining bowel, therefore the most effective medical therapy should be administered.},

METHODS: Ten active UC (aUC), 10 inactive UC (iUC), 6 aCD, and 8 iCD patients and 10 healthy individuals were included in the study. Circulating Foxp3-, IDO-, IL-17A-, IL-4-, IFN- gamma -, and IL-10-expressing CD4(+) T cells were quantitated by flow cytometry. Interleukin-17-expressing cells, CD25(+)/Foxp3(+) Tregs, and CD123(+)/IDO(+) plasmacytoid dendritic cells were evaluated in intestinal biopsies from 10 aUC, 6 aCD, and 10 noninflamed tissues. RESULTS: All CD4(+) T subsets were increased in aIBD patients compared with healthy donors. Meanwhile, frequency of CD8 alpha (+)/CD16(+)/IDO(+), CD8 alpha (+)/CD56(+)/IDO(+), CD8 alpha (+)/CD80(+)/IDO(+), CD8 alpha (+)/CD123(+)/IDO(+) large granular nonlymphoid cells, and CCR6(+)/CD123(+)/IDO(+) plasmacytoid dendritic cells was higher in aIBD patients versus healthy donors or iIBD patients. Tissue IL-17A(+) cells were present in higher amounts in aIBD versus noninflamed controls. IDO- and Foxp3-expressing cells were increased in aUC versus aCD patients and noninflamed tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The findings represent an original work in Mexican Mestizo patients with IBD. It shows that Tregs and IDO-expressing cells are increased with regard to disease activity. These cells could significantly shape inflammatory bowel disease pathophysiology, severity, and tolerance loss.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate concordance between parent and child ratings of health-related quality of life on the IMPACT-III questionnaire in children with IBD. METHODS: The IMPACT-III questionnaire was used to measure quality of life in 27 patients (mean age 14.2 +/- 3 years, 40% girls) and one of their parents (82% mothers). Most of the patients had inactive disease at the time of the study. Differences between parent-proxy ratings and child ratings on the IMPACT-III were compared via paired-samples t tests, intraclass correlation coefficients, and standardized difference scores. RESULTS: Parent-proxy and patient ratings were similar on total IMPACT-III and its related domains (bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, social functioning, body image, treatment/interventions), except that significant differences on emotional functioning ratings were found (P = 0.003). Intraclass correlation coefficients showed medium-to-large effect sizes (range 0.52-0.88) and standardized difference scores showed varying degrees of bias depending on the domain measured (range -0.64 to 0.32). CONCLUSIONS: Parents served as a good proxy for quality-of-life ratings in this population of pediatric patients with IBD. The degree of concordance between parent and child scores, however, varied, as observed in the present study in which parents underreported their child's health-related quality of life on the IMPACT-III emotional functioning domain.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vanin-1 is an epithelial pantetheinase, which regulates intestinal inflammation in mouse. We investigated whether human VNN1 levels could be associated to the susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and explored the participation of PPARg to these processes. METHODS: We studied VNN1 expression in colon biopsies from IBD patients. We investigated polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of the VNN1 gene and examined their genetic association with the disease. Functional relevance of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was assayed, and we tested PPARg in nuclear complexes associated with specific VNN1 polymorphic sequences. In mouse, we examined Vanin-1 expression in gut and feces during dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis and assayed the effect of PPARg on Vanin-1 regulation. RESULTS: VNN1 is expressed by enterocytes and is upregulated in IBD. Three SNPs are statistically associated to IBD. The regions containing these SNPs specifically bind nuclear complexes and are correlated with the VNN1 transcript abundance in colon in an allele-dependent manner. One rare SNP is associated to severe ulcerative colitis with strong VNN1 and dropped PPARg levels. PPARg is involved in nuclear complexes that bound to VNN1 regulatory sites. Similarly, Vanin-1 is tightly regulated in the mouse gut in normal and colitis conditions and PPARg regulates its expression. CONCLUSIONS: VNN1 is a marker for IBD. Polymorphic positions in the VNN1 locus are direct targets for nuclear factors that might regulate the level of VNN1 in colon, and this could be linked to IBD susceptibility. It is hoped that modulating locally VNN1 expression or activity can be exploited to develop future therapeutic strategies against IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anemia is poorly studied in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. This study explored the epidemiology and associated factors of anemia at diagnosis, after 1 year, and during treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN). METHODS: Three cohorts were included: (1) a representative population of newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease children (n = 184); (2) patients currently receiving care with data available at diagnosis (n = 179) and after 1 year (n = 139); and (3) 84 children treated with EEN. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 72% were anemic. Abnormal inflammatory markers were more common in Crohn's disease with severe anemia (severe versus no anemia [%]: raised C-reactive protein; 89% versus 48%; suboptimal albumin; 97% versus 29%; P < 0.002). Anemic children with Crohn's disease had shorter diagnosis delay and lower BMI than nonanemic patients (severe versus mild versus no anemia, median [interquartile range]; diagnosis delay [months]: 3 [3.9] versus 6 [10] versus 8 [18], P < 0.001; BMI z score [SD]: -1.4 [1.4] versus -1.3 [1.5] versus -0.2 [1.4], P = 0.003). Extensive colitis was associated with severe anemia in ulcerative colitis. The proportion of severely anemic patients decreased from 34% to 9% and mild anemia doubled at 1 year. After EEN, severe anemia decreased (32% to 9%; P < 0.001) and the hemoglobin concentration increased by 0.75 g/dL. This was observed only after 8 weeks of treatment. Disease improvement and low hemoglobin at EEN initiation but not weight gain were associated with hemoglobin improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is high at diagnosis and follow-up and should receive more attention from the clinical team; however, the focus should remain suppression of inflammatory process in active disease.},

   abstract = {The epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract is one of the most versatile tissues in the organism, responsible for providing a tight barrier between dietary and bacterial antigens and the mucosal and systemic immune system while maintaining efficient digestive and absorptive processes to ensure adequate nutrient and energy supply. Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are associated with a breakdown of both functions, which in some cases are clearly interrelated. In this updated literature review, we focus on the effects of intestinal inflammation and the associated immune mediators on selected aspects of the transepithelial transport of macronutrients and micronutrients. The mechanisms responsible for nutritional deficiencies are not always clear and could be related to decreased intake, malabsorption, and excess losses. We summarize the known causes of nutrient deficiencies and the mechanism of inflammatory bowel disease-associated diarrhea. We also overview the consequences of impaired epithelial transport, which infrequently transcend its primary purpose to affect the gut microbial ecology and epithelial integrity. Although some of those regulatory mechanisms are relatively well established, more work needs to be done to determine how inflammatory cytokines can alter the transport process of nutrients across the gastrointestinal and renal epithelia.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with its two distinct entities, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) are autoimmune diseases. The prevalence of these diseases continues to rapidly rise in the industrialized world. Despite the identification of several genetic loci that are associated with both IBD and T1D, thus far, there is a paucity of epidemiological data to support a clinical overlap. In an effort to better understand the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of both IBD and T1D, this review summarizes the literature about these related autoimmune diseases, describes the most recent advances in their etiopathogenesis and emphasizes the genetic and nongenetic factors that exercise a differential influence. Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic loci with a role in immune response regulation that are linked to both IBD (particularly Crohn's disease) and T1D. Some of these genetic loci (e.g., IL-18RAP) have a divergent role, conferring risk for one disease and protection for the other. Recent evidence highlights an important role of gut microbiota and cellular responses (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum stress) in the pathogenesis of both IBD and T1D.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease-associated liver diseases (IBD-LDs) include autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and an overlap syndrome. Prospective unbiased multicenter data regarding the frequency of IBD-LD in patients with pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are lacking. We examined early alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) elevations in children diagnosed as having IBD and assessed the likelihood of IBD-LD. METHODS: Data collected from the prospective observational Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Collaborative Research Group Registry enrolling children of age <16 years within 30 days of diagnosis. AIH, PSC, and overlap syndrome were diagnosed using local institutional criteria. RESULTS: A total of 1569 subjects had liver enzymes available. Of the total, 757 had both ALT and GGT, 800 had ALT only (no GGT), and 12 had GGT only (no ALT). Overall, 29 of 1569 patients (1.8%) had IBD-LD. IBD-LD was diagnosed in 1 of 661 (0.15%) of patients with both ALT and GGT </= 50 IU/L compared with 21 of 42 (50%) of patients with both ALT and GGT > 50 (odds ratio 660, P < 0.0001). Of the 29 patients with IBD-LD, 21 had PSC, 2 had AIH, and 6 had overlap syndrome. IBD-LD was more common in patients with ulcerative colitis and IBD-unclassified (indeterminate colitis) than in those with Crohn disease (4% vs 0.8%, respectively, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of both ALT and GGT within 90 days after the diagnosis of IBD is associated with a markedly increased likelihood of IBD-LD. Both ALT and GGT levels should be measured in all of the pediatric patients newly diagnosed as having IBD.},

Male Wistar rats, divided into five groups, were included in a 4-week dietary intervention study. Of the groups, four were exposed in the fourth week to 5 % dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce colitis, while one group was unexposed. The diets were: (1) control, (2) control + DSS, (3) FO (5 %) + DSS, (4) FP (3.5 %) + DSS, (5) FO + FP + DSS. Following DSS intake, weight and disease activity index (DAI) were assessed, and histological combined score (HCS), selected colonic PG, cytokines, oxidative damage markers and mRNA levels were measured. FP reduced HCS, tended to lower DAI (P = 0.07) and reduced keratinocyte chemoattractant/growth-regulated oncogene levels, as compared with the FO diet. FP also reduced mRNA levels of Il-6 and Cxcl1, although not significantly. FO intake increased the DAI as compared with DSS alone. PGE3 levels increased after the FO diet, and even more following FO + FP intake. The FP diet seems to have a protective effect in DSS-induced colitis as compared with FO. A number of beneficial, but non-significant, changes also occurred after FP v. DSS. A combined FO + FP diet may influence PG synthesis, as PGE3 levels were higher after the combined diet than after FO alone.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: 25(OH) vitamin D levels may be low in patients with moderately or severely active inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn's disease and Idiopathic Ulcerative Colitis) but this is less clear in patients with mild or inactive IBD. Furthermore there is limited information of any family influence on 25(OH) vitamin D levels in IBD. As a possible risk factor we hypothesize that vitamin D levels may also be low in families of IBD patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate 25[OH] vitamin D levels in patients with IBD in remission or with mild activity. A second objective is to evaluate whether there are relationships within IBD family units of 25[OH] vitamin D and what are the influences associated with these levels. METHODS: Participants underwent medical history, physical examination and a 114 item diet questionnaire. Serum 25[OH] vitamin D was measured, using a radioimmunoassay kit, (replete >/= 75, insufficient 50-74, deficient < 25-50, or severely deficient < 25 nmol/L). Associations between 25[OH] vitamin D and twenty variables were evaluated using univariate regression. Multivariable analysis was also applied and intrafamilial dynamics were assessed. RESULTS: 55 patients and 48 controls with their respective families participated (N206). 25[OH] vitamin D levels between patients and controls were similar (71.2 +/- 32.8 vs. 68.3 +/-26.2 nmol/L). Vitamin D supplements significantly increased intake but correlation with serum 25[OH] vitamin D was significant only during non sunny months among patients. Within family units, patients' families had mean replete levels (82.3 +/- 34.2 nmol/L) and a modest correlation emerged during sunny months between patients and family (r2 =0.209 p = 0.032). These relationships were less robust and non significant in controls and their families. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild or inactive IBD 25[OH] vitamin D levels are less than ideal but are similar to controls. Taken together collectively, the results of this study suggest that patient family dynamics may be different in IBD units from that in control family units. However contrary to the hypothesis, intra familial vitamin D dynamics do not pose additional risks for development of IBD.},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare postoperative outcomes after different techniques of management of the defunctionalized (colo)rectal stump. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Patients undergoing laparoscopic total abdominal colectomy for ulcerative colitis during 1998 to 2010 were assigned to an intraperitoneal group (creation of Hartmann rectal stump) or a subcutaneous group (subcutaneous placement of rectosigmoid stump). OUTCOME MEASURE: Postoperative morbidity was defined as complications occurred within 30 days after the operation or during the same hospital stay. RESULTS: Of 204 patients, 99 were in the intraperitoneal group and 105 were in the subcutaneous group. There were no significant differences in demographics or preoperative data, with the exception of a significantly increased age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index and preoperative total parental nutrition use in the intraperitoneal group. There was 1 postoperative death for myocardial infarction in the subcutaneous group. Overall postoperative morbidity, pelvic sepsis rates, and length of hospital stay were similar. Stump leaks occurred in 5 patients in the intraperitoneal group vs 10 patients in the subcutaneous group (p = 0.23). All stump leaks in the subcutaneous group only required local wound treatments without causing pelvic sepsis or need for reoperation. Pelvic sepsis in the intraperitoneal group required reoperation in 1 case, CT-guided drainage in 3, and antibiotics alone in 2 cases. Pelvic sepsis in the subcutaneous group required CT-guided drainage in 3 cases and antibiotics alone in 1 case. CONCLUSION: With the limitations of a retrospective study, postoperative outcomes were comparable after either technique of stump management, none of which could offset the risk of pelvic sepsis. Subcutaneous placement of colorectal stump was associated with more frequent but less morbid complications.},

   abstract = {Treatment options for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are notoriously either inadequate (IBS) or loaded with potentially serious side effects and risks (IBD). In recent years, a growing interest in effective and safer alternatives has focused on the potential role of probiotics and their metabolic substrates, prebiotics. It is in fact conceivable that the microbiome might be targeted by providing the metabolic fuel needed for the growth and expansion of beneficial microorganisms (prebiotics) or by administering to the host such microorganisms (probiotics). This review presents a concise update on currently available data, with a special emphasis on children. Data for prebiotics in IBS are scarce. Low doses have shown a beneficial effect, while high doses are counterproductive. On the contrary, several controlled trials of probiotics have yielded encouraging results. A meta-analysis including nine randomized clinical trials in children showed an improvement in abdominal pain for Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938, and the probiotic mixture VSL#3. The patients most benefiting from probiotics were those with predominant diarrhea or with a post-infectious IBS. In IBD, the use of prebiotics has been tested only rarely and in small scale clinical trials, with mixed results. As for probiotics, data in humans from about three dozens clinical trials offer mixed outcomes. So far, none of the tested probiotics has proven successful in Crohn's disease, while in ulcerative colitis a recent meta-analysis on 12 clinical trials (1 of them in children) showed efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in contributing to induce and to maintain remission. It is evident that this is a rapidly evolving and promising field; more data are very likely to yield a better understanding on what strains should be used in different specific clinical settings and in what doses.},

   abstract = {Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) are organised as a single cell layer which covers the intestine. Their primary task is to absorb nutrients present in the intestinal lumen. However, IEC also play an important role in the immune defence of our body by building a barrier that separates the bowel wall from potentially hazardous bacteria present in the gut lumen. The life cycle of IEC is determined by the time span in which cells migrate from their place of origin at the crypt base to the villus tip, from where they are shed into the lumen. Cell death in the intestinal epithelium has to be tightly regulated and irregularities might cause pathologies. Excessive cell death has been associated with chronic inflammation as seen in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. While until recently apoptosis was discussed as being essential for epithelial turnover and tissue homeostasis in the intestinal epithelium, recent data using gene deficient mice have challenged this concept. Moreover, an apoptosis-independent mode of programmed cell death, termed necroptosis, has been identified and described in the intestinal epithelium. The following article reviews previous studies on cell death regulation in IEC and a potential role of necroptosis for gut homeostasis.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: By screening seven traditional Chinese herbs, we found that Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis were the most effective in promoting the growth of probiotics including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in vitro. We then evaluated the effects of Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis on the growth of the bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella spp.) in vitro. In in vivo experiment, we gavage administrated trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid induced ulcerative colitis (UC) rats with Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis extracts. After two weeks treatment, we analyzed the structure of the gut microbiota and examined the UC symptoms by employing qPCR and animal pathology detection techniques. RESULTS: Both Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis promoted the growth of probiotics - Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in vitro. Red Ginseng also inhibited the growth of some pathogen strains. In vivo, Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis improved the structure of gut microbiota and relieved the symptoms of ulcerative colitis in vivo. Compared with Semen Coicis, Red Ginseng was more effective in relieving the symptoms of ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Red Ginseng could promote the growth of probiotic bacteria in vitro. Red Ginseng and, to a lesser extent Semen Coicis, gave positive results in an experimental in vivo model for ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Extensive research over the past half century has shown that curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of the golden spice turmeric (Curcuma longa), can modulate multiple cell signaling pathways. Extensive clinical trials over the past quarter century have addressed the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of this nutraceutical against numerous diseases in humans. Some promising effects have been observed in patients with various pro-inflammatory diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, uveitis, ulcerative proctitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel disease, tropical pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer, idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor, oral lichen planus, gastric inflammation, vitiligo, psoriasis, acute coronary syndrome, atherosclerosis, diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic microangiopathy, lupus nephritis, renal conditions, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, beta-thalassemia, biliary dyskinesia, Dejerine-Sottas disease, cholecystitis, and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Curcumin has also shown protection against hepatic conditions, chronic arsenic exposure, and alcohol intoxication. Dose-escalating studies have indicated the safety of curcumin at doses as high as 12 g/day over 3 months. Curcumin's pleiotropic activities emanate from its ability to modulate numerous signaling molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic proteins, NF-kappaB, cyclooxygenase-2, 5-LOX, STAT3, C-reactive protein, prostaglandin E(2), prostate-specific antigen, adhesion molecules, phosphorylase kinase, transforming growth factor-beta, triglyceride, ET-1, creatinine, HO-1, AST, and ALT in human participants. In clinical trials, curcumin has been used either alone or in combination with other agents. Various formulations of curcumin, including nanoparticles, liposomal encapsulation, emulsions, capsules, tablets, and powder, have been examined. In this review, we discuss in detail the various human diseases in which the effect of curcumin has been investigated.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon. alpha-Mangostin (alpha-MG), the most abundant xanthone in mangosteen fruit, exerts anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities in vitro. We evaluated the impact of dietary alpha-MG on murine experimental colitis and on the gut microbiota of healthy mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Colitis was induced in C57BL/6J mice by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Mice were fed control diet or diet with alpha-MG (0.1%). alpha-MG exacerbated the pathology of DSS-induced colitis. Mice fed diet with alpha-MG had greater colonic inflammation and injury, as well as greater infiltration of CD3(+) and F4/80(+) cells, and colonic myeloperoxidase, than controls. Serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, IL-6, and serum amyloid A were also greater in alpha-MG-fed animals than in controls. The colonic and cecal microbiota of healthy mice fed alpha-MG but no DSS shifted to an increased abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, a profile similar to that found in human UC. CONCLUSION: alpha-MG exacerbated colonic pathology during DSS-induced colitis. These effects may be associated with an induction of intestinal dysbiosis by alpha-MG. Our results suggest that the use of alpha-MG-containing supplements by patients with UC may have unintentional risk.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Questionnaires exist to assess inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related knowledge of adults. Owing to wording and content concerns, these were believed to be inappropriate for use in pediatric patients. The aim of this study was to develop a questionnaire to assess disease-related knowledge of pediatric patients with IBD and their parents. METHODS: Following a formal process of item generation and reduction, the IBD-Knowledge Inventory Device was developed and pilot tested. It was administered to 10- to 17-year-old patients with IBD, and to 1 of each of their parents. To evaluate its discriminatory validity, pediatric residents, nurses, and ward clerks completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients (mean 42, Crohn disease 46, age 14(+/-2) years) and 99 parents completed the IBD-Knowledge Inventory Device. Parent knowledge scores, 15(+/-4), were higher than those of patients, 11(+/-4), P < 0.001. Patient and parent knowledge scores were strongly correlated (r = 0.62, P < 0.001). Patient knowledge score was significantly related to disease type (Crohn disease scored higher than ulcerative colitis, P = 0.004) and to perceived knowledge level (P < 0.001) by regression analysis. Similarly, parent knowledge score was significantly related to sex (girls scored higher, P = 0.014), postsecondary education (P < 0.001), and perceived knowledge level (P = 0.002). The questionnaire scores of 23 were 19, 16, and 10, respectively, for residents, nurses, and ward clerks. Both residents and nurses scored significantly higher than ward clerks (P = 0.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: A valid IBD-related knowledge assessment questionnaire was developed for use in older children and adolescents with IBD and their parents.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the colonic mucosa. Administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to animals is a frequently used model to mimic human colitis. Deregulation of the immune response to the enteric microflora or pathogens as well as increased intestinal permeability have been proposed as disease-driving mechanisms. To enlarge the understanding of the pathogenesis, we have studied the effect of DSS on the immune system and gut microbiota in mice. Intestinal inflammation was verified through histological evaluation and myeloperoxidase activity. Immunological changes were assessed by flow cytometry in spleen, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes and through multiplex cytokine profiling. In addition, quantification of the total amount of bacteria on colonic mucosa as well as the total amount of lactobacilli, Akkermansia, Desulfovibrio and Enterobacteriaceae was performed by the use of quantitative PCR. Diversity and community structure were analysed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) patterns, and principal component analysis was utilized on immunological and T-RFLP patterns. DSS-induced colitis show clinical and histological similarities to UC. The composition of the colonic microflora was profoundly changed and correlated with several alterations of the immune system. The results demonstrate a relationship between multiple immunological changes and alterations of the gut microbiota after DSS administration. These data highlight and improve the definition of the immunological basis of the disease and suggest a role for dysregulation of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of colitis.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are emerging globally, indicating that environmental factors may be important in their pathogenesis. Colonic mucosal epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, can occur in response to the environment and have been implicated in IBD pathology. However, mucosal DNA methylation has not been examined in treatment-naive patients. We studied DNA methylation in untreated, left sided colonic biopsy specimens using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. We analyzed 22 control (C) patients, 15 untreated Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and 9 untreated ulcerative colitis (UC) patients from two cohorts. Samples obtained at the time of clinical remission from two of the treatment-naive UC patients were also included into the analysis. UC-specific gene expression was interrogated in a subset of adjacent samples (5 C and 5 UC) using the Affymetrix GeneChip PrimeView Human Gene Expression Arrays. Only treatment-naive UC separated from control. One-hundred-and-twenty genes with significant expression change in UC (> 2-fold, P<0.05) were associated with differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Epigenetically associated gene expression changes (including gene expression changes in the IFITM1, ITGB2, S100A9, SLPI, SAA1, and STAT3 genes) were linked to colonic mucosal immune and defense responses. These findings underscore the relationship between epigenetic changes and inflammation in pediatric treatment-naive UC and may have potential etiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic relevance for IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The interaction between a disturbed microbial composition, the intestinal mucosal barrier and the mucosal immune system plays an important role in IBD and its chronicity. It has been indicated that due to the altered microbial composition the balance between T regulatory cells (Treg) and T helper cells (Th) 17 is disturbed, leading to an inflammatory state. The present study shows that oral intake of a specific multi fibre mix (MF), designed to match the fibre content of a healthy diet, counteracts IBD-like intestinal inflammation and weight loss in dextran sodium sulphate treated mice. This reduction in inflammation might be brought about, at least in part, by the MF-induced decrease in inflammatory cytokines, increase in IL-10 and the relative increase in Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Moreover, the Treg percentage in the MLN correlates with the percentage of tolerogenic lamina propria derived CD103+RALDH+dendritic cells in the MLN, suggesting that these play a role in the observed effects. In children with CD exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a widely used safe and effective therapy. Optimizing enteral nutritional concepts with the tested fibre mix, know to modulate the gut microbiota composition, SCFA production and inflammatory status (as indicated by the present study) could possibly further improve efficacy in inducing remission.},

   abstract = {In the intestinal mucosa trefoil factors (TFF) and mucins (Muc) - primarily produced by goblet cells - are thought to play a major role in providing barrier function during infection and inflammation. To investigate their role in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) we obtained mucosal biopsies of children with CD, UC and healthy controls and analyzed genetic expression. Levels of TFF2 mRNA were lower in inflamed mucosal samples (terminal ileum (TI) and duodenum) of children with CD, but higher in non-inflamed mucosal samples when compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). Similarly, TFF2 levels in the TI were significantly lower in inflamed UC tissue. Adjustment for goblet cell density revealed slightly less marked, yet significantly different gene expression in IBD and controls. Furthermore, TI expression of TFF2 and Muc2 was inversely correlated with interleukin-8 expression in CD (p = 0.027). In Summary, our data demonstrate significant changes in Muc and TFF mRNA expression in pediatric patients with IBD suggesting a role in mucosal healing. Further studies are needed to elucidate a potential use as biomarkers for disease progression.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Gender differences in paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are frequently reported as a secondary outcome and the results are divergent. To assess gender differences by analysing data collected within the Swiss IBD cohort study database since 2008, related to children with IBD, using the Montreal classification for a systematic approach. METHODS: Data on gender, age, anthropometrics, disease location at diagnosis, disease behaviour, and therapy of 196 patients, 105 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 91 with ulcerative or indeterminate colitis (UC/IC) were retrieved and analysed. RESULTS: THE CRUDE GENDER RATIO (MALE : female) of patients with CD diagnosed at <10 years of age was 2.57, the adjusted ratio was 2.42, and in patients with UC/IC it was 0.68 and 0.64 respectively. The non-adjusted gender ratio of patients diagnosed at >/=10 years was 1.58 for CD and 0.88 for UC/IC. Boys with UC/IC diagnosed <10 years of age had a longer diagnostic delay, and in girls diagnosed with UC/IC >10 years a more important use of azathioprine was observed. No other gender difference was found after analysis of age, disease location and behaviour at diagnosis, duration of disease, familial occurrence of IBD, prevalence of extra-intestinal manifestations, complications, and requirement for surgery. CONCLUSION: CD in children <10 years affects predominantly boys with a sex ratio of 2.57; the impact of sex-hormones on the development of CD in pre-pubertal male patients should be investigated.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract mucosa and is related to an abnormal immune response to commensal bacteria. Our aim of the present work has been to explore the levels of antibodies (IgG and IgA) raised against extracellular proteins produced by LAB and its association with IBD. We analyzed, by Western-blot and ELISA, the presence of serum antibodies (IgA and IgG) developed against extracellular protein fractions produced by different food bacteria from the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. We used a sera collection consisting of healthy individuals (HC, n = 50), Crohn's disease patients (CD, n = 37), and ulcerative colitis patients (UC, n = 15). Levels of IgA antibodies developed against a cell-wall hydrolase from Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus GG (CWH) were significantly higher in the IBD group (P < 0.002; n = 52). The specificity of our measurements was confirmed by measuring IgA antibodies developed against the CWH peptide 365-VNTSNQTAAVSAS-377. IBD patients appeared to have different immune response to food bacteria. This paper sets the basis for developing systems for early detection of IBD, based on the association of high levels of antibodies developed against extracellular proteins from food and probiotic bacteria.},

   abstract = {Growth and nutritional status are important issues in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While linear growth is easy to assess, nutritional status is more complicated, with reports often compromised by the use of simple measures, such as weight and the body mass index, to assess nutritional status rather than more appropriate and sophisticated techniques to measure body composition. This review is an update on what is currently known about nutritional status as determined by body composition in paediatric IBD. Further, this review will focus on the impact of biologics on growth in paediatric IBD. Significant lean mass deficits have been reported in children with IBD compared with controls, and there is evidence these deficits persist over time. Furthermore, data imply that gender differences exist in body composition, both at diagnosis and in response to treatment. With respect to growth improvements following treatment with biologics, there are conflicting data. While some studies report enhancement of growth, others do not. The relationship between disease severity, impaired growth and the requirement for biologics needs to be considered when interpreting these data. However, key features associated with improvements in growth appear to be successful clinical response to treatment, patients in early stages of puberty, and the presence of growth failure at the onset of treatment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: It is reported that malnutrition is not a feature of ulcerative colitis (UC). Body mass index (BMI) is frequently used clinically to indicate nutritional status; however, it is a proxy measure at best, and body cell mass (BCM) is a much more accurate representation. The present study aims to investigate BMI in patients with UC in relation to their BCM. METHODS: A total of 18 patients (7M; 11F) had their nutritional status (BCM) measured using total body potassium(4)(0) counting every 6 months to yield a total of 77 measurements. BCM measurements were adjusted for height and sex, and BMI was calculated as weight/height(2), with z scores determined for both parameters. Disease activity was determined using the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) height, weight, BMI, and BCM z scores were 0.39 (0.96), 0.20 (1.08), -0.05 (1.18), and -0.74 (1.41), respectively. No correlation was found between BMI and BCM z scores, and these z scores were significantly different (P=0.02), particularly in the moderate/severe disease activity group (P=0.01). Mean BCM z scores were -0.69 (1.65) of a z score below BMI z scores. Furthermore, where BMI z scores showed no relation to disease activity and no differences between disease activity categories, BCM z scores were significantly negatively correlated (r=-0.32, P=0.01), with significantly lower scores found in the moderate/severe group (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Simply calculating BMI in patients with UC does not give adequate information regarding nutritional status, and more accurate, yet easily accessible "bedside" techniques need to be determined to improve patient care.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The present understanding of inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis mainly relies on studies of adult patients. Therefore, we studied the balance between T-effector and regulatory cells in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry served to quantify the expression of immunological markers in mucosal biopsies and flow cytometry analysis was used in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Colonic interleukin (IL)-17+, IL-22, and IL-6 mRNA upregulation and increase in the number of colonic IL-17 cells were demonstrated in both Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Likewise, colonic forkhead box P3 (FOXP3+) mRNA expression and the number of colonic FOXP3 cells were increased both in CD and in UC and were accompanied in CD also with increased numbers of FOXP3+CD25 High CD4 cells in peripheral blood. Ileal relation of IL-17/CD4 cells was increased only in CD. CONCLUSIONS: We showed activation of colonic IL-17/IL-22 axis and upregulation of FOXP3 to occur both in pediatric CD and in UC, indicating shared immunological characteristics. Upregulation of IL-17 was restricted to colon in UC, but existed in the ileum and in the colon in active CD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recent research suggests a relationship of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and depression. Our objective was to evaluate for improvement of depressive symptoms with treatment of IBD using immunosuppressive medications. METHODS: A retrospective study of consecutive patients with IBD started on immunosuppressive agents [anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) or immunomodulator therapy] was conducted. Patients were evaluated if disease activity indices using Harvey Bradshaw Index for Crohn's disease (CD) and Simple Clinical Colitis Disease Activity Index for ulcerative colitis (UC) and depressive indices using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores were obtained before and at least 30 days after initiation of therapy. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with UC and 53 patients with CD (all with active disease symptoms) were evaluated over a 60 day median follow-up evaluation (range 30, 140 days). Twenty-two patients started on immunomodulator therapy, and 47 patients started on anti-TNF therapy. Crohn's disease patients had significantly decreased PHQ-9 scores at follow-up [median 9 (range 3, 14) to 4 (1, 8)], with significant decreases only in those started on anti-TNF therapy. Changes in PHQ-9 and CRP were correlated (rho = 0.38, p < 0.05). In patients with UC, PHQ-9 scores [5 (3, 9) to 2 (0, 5)] were significantly decreased. Percentage at risk of moderate to severe depression (PHQ-9 scores >/=10) was lower after treatment [Crohn's disease 51-18 % (p < 0.05), ulcerative colitis 18-0 %]. CONCLUSION: Depressive scores decreased significantly in patients with IBD treated with immunosuppressive therapy and the number at risk for moderate to severe depression improved significantly.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Glutamine (Gln) is a nutrient with immunomodulatory effects in metabolic stressed conditions. This study investigated the effects of Gln on colonic-inflammatory-mediator expression and mucosal repair in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice received distilled water containing 3 % DSS for 5 d to induce colitis. One of the DSS-treated groups was intraperitoneally injected with an alanyl (Ala)-Gln solution 3 days before (G-DSS) while the other group was administered Ala-Gln 3 days after colitis (DSS-G) was induced. The Ala-Gln solution provided 0.5 g Gln/kg/d. The saline-DSS group (S-DSS) received an identical amount of saline before and after colitis was induced to serve as a positive control. RESULTS: The S-DSS group had a shorter colon length, higher plasma haptoglobin level, and more-severe colon inflammation. Also, the toll-like receptor (TLR)4 level, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation, and inflammatory cytokine gene expression in the colon were higher than those of the normal control group. Gln administration either before or after colitis suppressed TLR4 protein levels, decreased plasma haptoglobin, and reduced colon inflammation. Histological inflammatory scores were also lowered. Compared to the post-colitis Gln group, preventive use of Gln had higher colon length, expressions of mucin 2, trefoil factor 3, and heat shock protein 72 genes were also upregulated in the colon. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Gln administered either before or after the colitis mitigated inflammation of colitis that was not observed in group without Gln injection. Prophylactic treatment with Gln had more-beneficial effects on reducing inflammatory markers and enhancing the recovery of mucosa in DSS-induced colitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a high prevalence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). CDI in children with IBD may differ from adults. We aim to compare the prevalence of CDI in hospitalized pediatric and adult IBD patients and patients without IBD. METHODS: The rates of CDI per 1,000 IBD and non-IBD hospitalizations between 1993 and 2012 were examined using the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission database. Age, sex and calendar year adjusted incidence rate ratios comparing CDI in pediatrics and adults by type of IBD and with patients without IBD were calculated. p values for trend identifying changes in rates over time were calculated. RESULTS: Among children, the rate of CDI was over 12 times greater in IBD than non-IBD hospitalizations (p < 0.0001) and among adults, the rate of CDI was four times greater in IBD than non-IBD hospitalizations (p < 0.0001). In adults, CDI was significantly higher in ulcerative colitis (UC) than Crohn's disease (60.4 per 1,000 vs. 19.8 per 1,000, p < 0.0001) but in children there was no difference in CDI in UC compared with Crohn's disease (32 per 1,000 vs. 27 per 1,000, p = 0.45). The prevalence of CDI increased in pediatric and adult IBD patients, and patients without IBD, between 1993 and 2012 (p for trend <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: CDI was more common in adult patients with UC, and no difference was found between CDI and IBD type in pediatrics. There may be different risk factors for CDI during hospitalization between adults and children with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) is widely used for screening of latent tuberculosis (TB) before and during biological therapy (BT). An indeterminate result of IGRA represents a limitation in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Data on factors influencing IGRA results are scarce in children. The aim of the study was to identify factors influencing IGRA results in children with IBD. METHODS: Seventy-two children with IBD (59 Crohn disease, 11 ulcerative colitis, 2 IBD-unclassified) indicated for BT were tested for TB infection (history, TB skin test, chest radiograph, IGRA; QuantiFERON-TB Gold in tube [QFT]) and consecutively retested using QFT in 1-year intervals. RESULTS: We recorded 165 results of QFT (3% positive, 87% negative, and 10% indeterminate results). During follow-up we identified 4 conversions of negative QFT to positivity (3%) and 4 reversions (4%). Patients with indeterminate results of QFT had significantly lower actual weight-for-height z score (P = 0.022), higher platelet count (P = 0.00017), and lower levels of serum albumin (P = 0.015) compared with patients with positive or negative QFT. Indeterminate QFT was associated with corticosteroid treatment, BT, and disease activity, but not with treatment by immunomodulators. In a subanalysis of patients with Crohn disease alone, Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index was identified as single independent risk factor for indeterminate results (P = 0.00037). CONCLUSIONS: Although corticosteroid treatment is traditionally considered to be the main risk factor for indeterminate results of IGRA, the disease activity of IBD has even more profound effects on the results.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The base of human Peyer patches of the terminal ileum has been noted to contain black granular pigment deposits, composed of titanium dioxide and aluminosilicate, which are food additives typically present in a Western diet, and pharmaceuticals. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of exogenous pigment throughout the gastrointestinal tract of children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the correlation between their age and the presence and amount of pigment in Peyer patches, and its relation to pediatric IBD. METHODS: Biopsies (upper and lower gastrointestinal tract) from children suspected of having IBD who underwent endoscopy, were reassessed by a blinded, expert pathologist. The amount of pigment in biopsies was scored using a semiquantitative scale (range 0 to +++). RESULTS: A total of 151 children were included: 62 with Crohn disease (CD), 26 with ulcerative colitis, and 63 with non-IBD. In 63 children (42%), deposits of black pigment were found only in biopsies from the terminal ileum, located in Peyer patches. A significant correlation was found between increasing age and the amount of pigment (P = 0.004). Pigment deposits were found significantly less in the patients with CD compared with those in patients with ulcerative colitis and those with non-IBD (26% vs 62% and 49%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for the hypothesis that the amount of pigment, only present in Peyer patches in the terminal ileum, becomes denser with increasing age. Absence of pigment in Peyer patches in a higher number of patients with CD suggests that microparticles may have become involved in the inflammatory process, possibly because of disrupted autophagy.},

   abstract = {Similar to adults, there is heterogeneous phenotypic expression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children. Thus, a classification system for disease characteristics is obligatory if one seeks to understand and eventually change the natural history of IBD. Extrapolation of adult clinical trial results to children also depends upon comparable classifications of disease. Features that can differentiate IBD in children from adults include more extensive and severe disease at presentation, frequent corticosteroid dependency, change in location and behavior over time, and the implications of disease for growth and sexual maturation. In contrast to the Montreal classification where all patients <17 years were grouped together, the Paris classification recognizes the different expression of pediatric IBD between those patients aged <10 years and those 10-17 years of age. The recent identification of monogenic disorders in very young children (<2 years) with severe IBD-like disease has further clouded the issue of where appropriate pediatric age guidelines should be drawn, though it is clear these infantile-onset cases should not be grouped with older children. The Paris classification recognizes the importance of upper tract disease on natural history by dividing it into L4a and L4b (proximal and distal to the ligament of Treitz, respectively), while the Montreal system groups all upper-tract patients together. Complicated disease behavior in the Montreal system mandated a single category preventing the concomitant designation as stricturing and penetrating, whereas the Paris classification recognizes that both stricturing and penetrating behavior may occur at the same or different times. Growth delay is recognized only in the Paris classification as a serious manifestation of IBD in children affecting therapeutic decisions. As our understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in IBD changes over time, it is likely that the IBD classification will change as well. A single classification system that reflects both pediatric and adult disease is needed.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the diet of pouch patients compared to healthy controls, and to correlate pouch patients' diet with disease behavior. METHODS: Pouch patients were recruited and prospectively followed-up at the Comprehensive Pouch Clinic at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. Pouch behavior was determined based on clinical, endoscopic and histological criteria. Healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers were selected from the "MABAT" Israeli Nutrition and Public Health Governmental Study and served as the control group. All the participants completed a 106-item food frequency questionnaire categorized into food groups and nutritional values based on those used in the United States Department of Agriculture food pyramid and the Israeli food pyramid. Data on Dietary behavior, food avoidance, the use of nutritional supplements, physical activity, smoking habits, and body-mass index (BMI) were also obtained. Pouch patients who had familial adenomatous polyposis (n = 3), irritable pouch syndrome (n = 4), or patients whose pouch surgery took place less than one year previously (n = 5) were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: The pouch patients (n = 80) consumed significantly more from the bakery products food group (1.2 +/- 1.4 servings/d vs 0.6 +/- 1.1 servings/d, P < 0.05) and as twice as many servings from the oils and fats (4.8 +/- 3.4 servings/d vs 2.4 +/- 2 servings/d, P < 0.05), and the nuts and seeds food group (0.3 +/- 0.6 servings/d vs 0.1 +/- 0.4 servings/d, P < 0.05) compared to the controls (n = 80). The pouch patients consumed significantly more total fat (97.6 +/- 40.5 g/d vs 84.4 +/- 39 g/d, P < 0.05) and fat components [monounsaturated fatty acids (38.4 +/- 16.4 g/d vs 30 +/- 14 g/d, P < 0.001), and saturated fatty acids (30 +/- 15.5 g/d vs 28 +/- 14.1 g/d, P < 0.00)] than the controls. In contrast, the pouch patients consumed significantly fewer carbohydrates (305.5 +/- 141.4 g/d vs 369 +/- 215.2 g/d, P = 0.03), sugars (124 +/- 76.2 g/d vs 157.5 +/- 90.4 g/d, P = 0.01), theobromine (77.8 +/- 100 mg/d vs 236.6 +/- 244.5 mg/d, P < 0.00), retinol (474.4 +/- 337.1 mug/d vs 832.4 +/- 609.6 mug/d, P < 0.001) and dietary fibers (26.2 +/- 15.4 g/d vs 30.7 +/- 14 g/d, P = 0.05) than the controls. Comparisons of the food consumption of the patients without (n = 23) and with pouchitis (n = 45) showed that the former consumed twice as many fruit servings as the latter (3.6 +/- 4.1 servings/d vs 1.8 +/- 1.7 servings/d, respectively, P < 0.05). In addition, the pouchitis patients consumed significantly fewer liposoluble antioxidants, such as cryptoxanthin (399 +/- 485 mug/d vs 890.1 +/- 1296.8 mug/d, P < 0.05) and lycopene (6533.1 +/- 6065.7 mug/d vs 10725.7 +/- 10065.9 mug/d, P < 0.05), and less vitamin A (893.3 +/- 516 mug/d vs 1237.5 +/- 728 mug/d, P < 0.05) and vitamin C (153.3 +/- 130 mg/d vs 285.3 +/- 326.3 mg/d, P < 0.05) than the patients without pouchitis. The mean BMI of the pouchitis patients was significantly lower than the BMI of the patients with a normal pouch: 22.6 +/- 3.2 vs 27 +/- 4.9 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Decreased consumption of antioxidants by patients with pouchitis may expose them to the effects of inflammatory and oxidative stress and contribute to the development of pouchitis.},

However, knowledge about the optimal way in which to use these drugs continues to evolve. In this paper, the evidence regarding optimal timing and dosing of thiopurines and biologics will be reviewed as will the role of thiopurine methyltransferase testing along with therapeutic drug monitoring of both thiopurines and biologics.

   abstract = {Carnitine is a vitamin-like compound that plays important roles in fatty acid beta-oxidation and the control of the mitochondrial coenzyme A/acetyl-CoA ratio. However, carnitine is not added to ordinary enteral nutrition or total parenteral nutrition. In this study, we determined the serum carnitine concentrations in subjects receiving ordinary enteral nutrition (EN) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases to compare its levels with those of other nutritional markers. Serum samples obtained from 11 EN and 11 TPN patients and 82 healthy controls were examined. In addition, 10 Crohn's disease and 10 ulcerative colitis patients with malnutrition who were barely able to ingest an ordinary diet were also evaluated. Carnitine and its derivatives were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The carnitine concentrations in EN and TPN subjects were significantly lower compared with those of the control subjects. Neither the serum albumin nor the total cholesterol level was correlated with the carnitine concentration, although a significant positive correlation was found between the serum albumin and total cholesterol levels. Indeed, patients with CD and UC showed significantly reduced serum albumin and/or total cholesterol levels, but their carnitine concentrations remained normal. In conclusion, only a complete blockade of an ordinary diet, such as EN or TPN, caused a reduction in the serum carnitine concentration. Serum carnitine may be an independent biomarker of malnutrition, and its supplementation is needed in EN and TPN subjects even if their serum albumin and total cholesterol levels are normal.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) self-management fits well within a social-cognitive framework. At the heart of social-cognitive theory is self-efficacy, a set of beliefs about one's ability to perform certain tasks. Self-efficacy is a strong predictor of health outcomes in chronic diseases and could serve as an intermediary outcome measure of self-management for pediatric IBD. The aim of this preliminary study was to develop items for the design of a self-efficacy scale specifically for adolescents and young adults with IBD. METHODS: Survey development is an iterative process. As defined by the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines for developing a patient-reported outcome measurement, the first step of this process is to obtain patient input. Using qualitative research methods, adolescents and young adults were recruited from an outpatient pediatric gastroenterology clinic to participate in a semistructured interview. Transcriptions of the recorded interviews were reviewed for themes related to self-efficacy around disease management. A consensus panel of gastroenterologists and health psychologists reviewed the initially constructed items. Those specific items were then reviewed and adjusted by a panel of participants for content and understandability using cognitive interview methods. The resulting 13-item scale is presented here. RESULTS: Nineteen patients and 5 parents participated in the study. The study sample was 42% girls, 79% whites, 74% had Crohn disease, and 79% had not required surgery. Median age was 15 years (range 10-22 years). Theme analysis and expert review yielded 13 items across 4 theoretical domains: managing medical care, managing daily life with IBD, managing emotions, and managing the future with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: A 13-item disease-specific scale has been developed based on patient input to assess self-efficacy around self-management in adolescents with IBD. Efforts to validate this newly designed scale are presently under way.},

   abstract = {Conventional medical therapies for ulcerative colitis (UC) are still limited due to the adverse side effects like dose-dependent diarrhoea and insufficient potency to keep in remission for long-term periods. So, new alternatives that provide more effective and safe therapies for ulcerative colitis are constantly being sought. In the present study, probiotic LaBb Dahi was selected for investigation of its therapeutic effect on DSS-induced colitis model in mice. LaBb Dahi was prepared by co-culturing Dahi culture of Lactococci along with selected strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus LaVK2 and Bifidobacterium bifidum BbVK3 in buffalo milk. Four groups of mice (12 each) were fed for 17 d with buffalo milk (normal control), buffalo milk plus DSS (Colitis control), Dahi plus DSS, and LaBb Dahi plus DSS, respectively, with basal diet. The disease activity scores, weight loss, organ weight, colon length, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and beta-glucoronidase activity was assessed, and the histopathological picture of the colon of mice was studied. All colitis control mice evidenced significant increase in MPO, beta-glucoronidase activity and showed high disease activity scores along with histological damage to colonic tissue. Feeding with LaBb Dahi offered significant reduction in MPO activity, beta-glucoronidase activity and improved disease activity scores. We found significant decline in length of colon, organ weight and body weight in colitis induced controls which were improved significantly by feeding LaBb Dahi. The present study suggests that LaBb Dahi can be used as a potential nutraceutical intervention to combat UC related changes and may offer effective adjunctive treatment for management of UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested to be associated with high risk of Crohn's disease (CD). In France, where food fortification is limited, the major source of vitamin D is through sun exposure. The aim of this work was to analyze the relationship between residential sun exposure and the risk of incident CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The E3N cohort consists of women living in France, aged 40 to 65 years and free of major diseases at inclusion in 1990. Among the 91,870 women included in the study, we identified 123 incident cases (45 CD, 71 UC, and 7 indeterminate colitis). To assess residential sun exposure, we used a database containing mean daily ultraviolet radiation (UVR) dose for each French county. The relationship between residential sun exposure and risk of incident inflammatory bowel diseases was explored using Cox models. RESULTS: Higher levels of residential sun exposure were associated with a significant decreased risk of CD (hazard ratio [HR] for the third versus the first tertile of UVR dose, 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23-1.01; P for trend = 0.04), but not of UC (HR, 1.21; CI, 0.61-2.11). In women with available data on dietary vitamin D intake, we observed a lower risk of CD with higher residential UVR (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.80; P for trend = 0.01). Dietary vitamin D intake was neither associated with the risk of CD (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.14-1.24; P for trend = 0.14) nor UC (HR, 1.61; CI, 0.61-4.23). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective cohort of women, high residential sunlight exposure was associated with decreased incidence of CD, but not UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: The primary therapeutic goals in ulcerative colitis (UC) are to maintain excellent quality of life (QOL) by treating flare-ups when they occur, and preventing flare-ups. Since stress can trigger UC flare-ups, we investigated the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to reduce flare-ups and improve QOL. METHODS: Patients with moderately severe UC, in remission, were randomized to MBSR or time/attention control. Primary outcome was disease status. Secondary outcomes were changes in markers of inflammation and disease activity, markers of stress and psychological assessments. RESULTS: 55 subjects were randomized. Absence of flares, time to flare and severity of flare over 1 year were similar between the two groups. However, post hoc analysis showed that MBSR decreased the proportion of participants with at least one flare-up among those with top tertile urinary cortisol and baseline perceived stress (30 vs. 70%; p < 0.001). MBSR patients who flared demonstrated significantly lower stress at the last visit compared to flared patients in the control group (p = 0.04). Furthermore, MBSR prevented a drop in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire during flare (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: MBSR did not affect the rate or severity of flare-ups in UC patients in remission. However, MBSR might be effective for those with high stress reactivity (high perceived stress and urinary cortisol) during remission. MBSR appears to improve QOL in UC patients by minimizing the negative impact of flare-ups on QOL. Further studies are needed to identify a subset of patients for whom MBSR could alter disease course.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk for developing colorectal neoplasia. Researchers have debated whether treatment of IBD with thiopurines reduces cancer risk. We performed a meta-analysis of thiopurine exposure and risk of colorectal dysplasia or cancer in patients with IBD. METHODS: We used MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane search engines and abstract books from international conferences to identify relevant literature. We included studies on thiopurine exposure and risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. We calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and performed a meta-regression analysis of the effect of year of publication. Various sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Fifteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Overall, we did not observe a significant effect of thiopurines on risk for colorectal neoplasia (dysplasia and/or cancer) in patients with IBD (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71-1.06). The estimate did not change markedly in separate assessments of the 2 population-based studies (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.59-1.29), the 13 clinic-based studies (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.59-1.09), the 7 cohort studies (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.67-1.28), or the 8 case-control studies (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.65-1.08). Studies that used neoplasia (dysplasia or cancer) as outcomes tended to show that thiopurines had protective effects (OR for neoplasia, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.50-1.05); these effects were not observed in studies of colorectal cancer (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.72-1.12) or in studies published in recent years (meta-regression; P = .16). CONCLUSIONS: In a meta-analysis, we did not find a significant protective effect of treatment with thiopurines on the risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms compatible with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. It has been suggested that these symptoms are a reflection of occult inflammation rather than coexisting IBS. The aim of this study was to characterize IBS-like symptoms in patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) in clinical remission by assessing inflammatory markers, psychological symptoms, and quality of life. METHODS: Ninety-four patients with new onset of UC were followed prospectively during 3 years with yearly follow-up visits. The patients completed self-administrated questionnaires. Fecal calprotectin was used as an inflammatory biomarker. Remission was defined as a total Mayo-score </=2 and an endoscopic subscore </=1, with no relapse during the 3-month period prior to visit. KEY RESULTS: The prevalence of patients that fulfilled Rome II criteria for IBS among UC patients in remission was 11% at visit 1, 23% at visit 2, and 17% at visit 3. When comparing UC patients in remission with and without IBS-like symptom, patients with IBS-like symptoms had more severe gastrointestinal symptoms, tendencies toward more severe psychological symptoms and reduced levels of quality of life, but the calprotectin levels did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: IBS-like symptoms are common in patients with UC in clinical remission and these fluctuate over time. The symptoms are associated with poor psychological well-being and reduced quality of life, and do not seem to be a reflection of low-grade inflammatory activity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic recurrent disease characterized by acute inflammation of the colonic mucosa. In Japan, a dietary supplementation product enriched with glutamine, dietary fiber, and oligosaccharide (GFO) is widely applied for enteral nutrition support. These three components have been suggested to improve intestinal health. In this study, we investigated whether GFO has suppressive effects on mucosal damage in ulcerative colitis in an experimental mouse model. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice received 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water for 5 d to induce colitis. Then, they were given 0.25 mL of GFO or a 20% glucose solution twice daily for 10 d. Another set of mice receiving unaltered drinking water was used as the normal control group. RESULTS: The body weight loss and disease activity index were significantly lower in the GFO-treated mice compared with the glucose-treated mice (P < 0.05). The decrease in colon length induced by dextran sulfate sodium was significantly alleviated in GFO-treated mice compared with glucose-treated mice (P < 0.01). In addition, the histologic findings showed that intestinal inflammation was significantly attenuated in mice treated with GFO. Furthermore, treatment with GFO significantly inhibited the dextran sulfate sodium-induced increase in the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that GFO has potential therapeutic value as an adjunct therapy for ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the delivery of stool from a healthy prescreened donor to an individual with disease, is gaining increasing recognition as a potential treatment for inflammatory bowel diseases. Our objective was to describe patient interest in and social concerns around FMT. METHODS: We conducted a survey of adults with ulcerative colitis (UC) seen in outpatient clinic at the University of Chicago IBD Center. All English-speaking patients >/=18 years of age were eligible. Subjects completed a written survey in clinic. Ninety-five participants, median age 39 years, 53% female, were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Forty-four percent and 49% reported excellent or good/satisfactory medical management of their UC, respectively. Forty-six percent participants were willing to undergo FMT as a treatment of UC, 43% were unsure, and 11% were unwilling to undergo FMT. Subjects who had been hospitalized were more willing to undergo FMT, 54% versus 34%, P = 0.035. Primary concerns included the following: adequate screening for infections (41%), cleanliness (24%), and potential to worsen UC (18%); 21% reported no specific concerns. For donor selection, an equal number of participants (46%) preferred whomever their doctor recommended or family member/spouse. CONCLUSIONS: In our center despite reporting satisfactory to excellent disease control with their treatments, the vast majority of patients with UC are interested in or willing to consider FMT. Proof of safety and effectiveness, and failure of other medical therapies are key issues in considering FMT. Strong interest in this as-yet unproven therapy warrants attention and is a pressing priority for clinical research and education.},

The present study aimed to investigate the nutritional status of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients in Isfahan, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this descriptive analytical cross-sectional study, between Dec 2011 and Jun 2012, 99 patients with UC were randomly selected and evaluated. Age, sex, duration of disease, body mass index (BMI) and laboratory parameters recorded for all patients. Nutritional risk index (NRI) was calculated and its association with patients' variables was assessed with regard to UC disease severity. RESULTS: Twelve patients out of 99 patients had mild UC and 87 patients had moderate to severe UC. Based on the NRI, 90.9% were not malnourished and 9.1% were at moderate to severe risk for malnutrition. Among laboratory parameters only, serum potassium level in patients with moderate to severe UC was significantly higher than those with mild UC (P = 0.017). Other laboratory parameters were similar between patients stratified by US status. Patients age s significantly correlate with serum vitamin D, immunoglobulin a (IgA) and potassium level (P > 0.05), also duration of disease was significantly correlate with Phosphorus (P = 0.024) among laboratory parameters. CONCLUSION: In studied UC patients, malnutrition risk was based on degree of disease severity. Patients with moderate to severe UC were more at risk for malnutrition compared to the patients with mild UC. Furthermore, among laboratory parameters only serum potassium level was higher among patients with moderate to severe UC compared to others.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and the development of atherosclerosis are increased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one type of IBD; however, there is controversy in the literature regarding the association between UC and stroke. The present cohort study estimated the risk of subsequent stroke among UC patients compared with that among matched comparison subjects drawn from a population-based data set in Taiwan. METHODS: This investigation analyzed administrative claims data sourced from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. Our study consisted of a study cohort comprising 516 UC patients and a comparison cohort of 2,579 subjects without IBD. Cox proportional hazards regressions were performed to estimate the risk of subsequent stroke during the follow-up period. We also conducted additional analyses investigating the risk of subsequent stroke by age group and gender. RESULTS: After adjusting for selected medical co-morbidities and recent prescriptions of selected pharmaceuticals, the hazard ratio (HR) for subsequent stroke among patients with UC was 2.045 (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.374-3.043) than that among comparison subjects. While we did not detect an association between stroke and UC among patients aged 30-40 or 40-50 years, we did detect increased risks for stroke among UC patients aged over 50 years (HR = 2.045). We also found the association to remain significant for both men (HR = 2.153) and women (HR = 2.750). CONCLUSIONS: This study detected an increased HR for subsequent stroke among Taiwanese UC patients hen compared to that among matched comparison patients without IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) is efficacious for induction and maintenance of remission in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It has, however, not been studied in patients 7 years old and younger. Our aim was to characterize efficacy and safety of IFX therapy in this cohort. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with IBD ages 7 years and younger, treated with IFX between 1999 and 2011. Medical records were reviewed for age of diagnosis, disease phenotype, therapy, surgery, IFX infusion dates, dose, and intervals. Outcome measures included physician global assessment, corticosteroid requirement, and adverse events. RESULTS: Thirty-three children (ages 2.4-7 years) were included. Twenty patients had Crohn disease, 4 had ulcerative colitis, and 9 had indeterminate colitis. Maintenance of IFX therapy at 1, 2, and 3 years was 36%, 18%, and 12%, respectively. Patients of age 5 years and younger had the lowest rates of maintenance of therapy at 25% at year 1, and 10% at years 2 and 3 combined. Nine percent of all of the patients demonstrated response measured by the physician global assessment and were steroid free at 1 year. There were 8 infusion reactions. There were no malignancies, serious infections, or deaths. CONCLUSIONS: IFX demonstrated a modest response rate and a low steroid-sparing effect in patients with IBD 7 years old and younger. Although this is a limited study, there appears to be a trend for decreased sustained efficacy with IFX in this age group, particularly in children 5 years old and younger, when compared with the previously published literature in older children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain. The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel, which is involved in visceral pain signalling, has been shown to be up-regulated in IBS. Activation of TRPV1 leads to the release of neuropeptides, such as somatostatin and substance P (SP). We hypothesized that increased pain perception in IBS could be explained by increased transcription in TRPV1 and/or altered levels of neuropeptides. We therefore assessed the transcription of TRPV1 and the mucosal concentration of somatostatin and SP in IBS in comparison to healthy volunteers and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission as disease controls, and to ascertain their relationship to pain symptoms. METHOD: Sigmoid colonic mucosal samples were collected from 12 patients with IBS, 34 patients with UC in remission and 9 healthy volunteers, in which groups TRPV1 mRNA levels were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and neuropeptide concentrations by radioimmunoassay. Pain symptom intensity was determined by questionnaires. RESULTS: Transcription of TRPV1 as well as the concentration of neuropeptides were significantly higher in IBS, but only the former correlated with pain symptom severity. CONCLUSION: Increased transcription of TRPV1 may provide a possible explanation for pain generation in IBS. While the neuropeptides SP and somatostatin were both found to be increased in IBS, these changes are not sufficient to explain pain generation. Pain generation in IBS is probably explained by a complex redundancy in the regulation of local nociceptive mechanisms, which remains a subject of intensive investigation.},

Such effects were investigated using in vitro batch cultures (with/without mucin, peptone or starch) inoculated with faecal slurries from healthy or UC patients; the growth of five bacterial groups was monitored along with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. Healthy cultures gave two-fold higher growth and SCFA levels with up to ten-fold higher butyrate production. Starch gave the highest growth and SCFA production (particularly butyrate), indicating starch-enhanced saccharolytic activity. Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were the predominant bacterial group (of five examined) for UC inocula whereas they were the minority group for the healthy inocula. Furthermore, SRB growth was stimulated by peptone presumably due to the presence of sulphur-rich amino acids. The results suggest raised SRB levels in UC, which could contribute to the condition through release of toxic sulphide.},

   abstract = {The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rapidly increasing in developing countries, especially among populations that are adopting Western-style diets. Several, but not all, epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that a high intake of meat, especially red and processed meat, is associated with increased CRC risk. Potential reasons for the association between high red and processed meat intake and CRC risk include the content of the meat (e.g. protein, heme) and compounds generated by the cooking process (e.g. N-nitroso compounds, heterocyclic amines). These factors can affect the large intestine mucosa with genotoxicity and metabolic disturbances. Increased bacterial fermentation (putrefaction) of undigested protein and production of bacterial metabolites derived from amino acids may affect colon epithelial homeostasis and renewal. This correlates with the fact that most colonic cancers are detected in the distal colon and rectum where protein fermentation actively occurs. However, there are still large controversies on the relationship between red meat consumption and CRC risk. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to enhance the current understanding on the association between high red and processed meat intakes with CRC risk. A principal focus of this review will be to discuss the meat-related components, such as proteins in the meat, heme, N-nitroso compounds, and heterocyclic amines, and the effects they have upon the large intestine mucosa and the intestinal gut microbiota.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Infliximab (IFX) is considered safe and effective for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) in both adults and children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short- and long-term clinical course of IFX in Korean children with UC. METHODS: Pediatric patients with UC who had received IFX infusions between November 2007 and May 2013 at Samsung Medical Center were retrospectively investigated. The clinical efficacy of IFX treatment was evaluated at 8 weeks (short term) and 54 weeks (long term) after the initiation of IFX treatment using the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI). The degree of response to IFX treatment was defined as complete response (PUCAI score=0), partial response (decrement of PUCAI score>/=20 points), and non-response (decrement of PUCAI score <20 points). Adverse events associated with IFX treatment were also investigated. RESULTS: Eleven pediatric patients with moderate to severe UC had received IFX. The remission rate after IFX treatment was 46% (5/11) and 82% (9/11) at 8 weeks and 54 weeks after IFX treatment, respectively. All patients who were steroid-dependent before treatment with IFX achieved remission at 54 weeks and were able to stop treatment with corticosteroids, while all steroid-refractory patients failed to achieve remission at 54 weeks after treatment with IFX. CONCLUSION: Response to IFX treatment after 8 weeks may predict a favorable long-term response to IFX treatment in Korean pediatric UC patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, involves chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Previously, Sasa quelpaertensis leaves have been shown to mediate anti-inflammation and anti-cancer effects, although it remains unclear whether Sasa leaves are able to attenuate inflammation-related intestinal diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of Sasa quelpaertensis leaf extract (SQE) using an in vitro co-culture model of the intestinal epithelial environment. MATERIALS/METHODS: An in vitro co-culture system was established that consisted of intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce inflammation. RESULTS: Treatment with SQE significantly suppressed the secretion of LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-6, and IL-1beta in co-cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages. In addition, expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were down-regulated in response to inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation by SQE. Compared with two bioactive compounds that have previously been identified in SQE, tricin and P-coumaric acid, SQE exhibited the most effective anti-inflammatory properties. CONCLUSIONS: SQE exhibited intestinal anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting various inflammatory mediators mediated through nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-kB) activation. Thus, SQE has the potential to ameliorate inflammation-related diseases, including IBD, by limiting excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {Sasa quelpaertensis leaves exert anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic effects, although it remains unclear whether these leaves can suppress inflammation-related intestinal diseases. This study hypothesized that Sasa quelpaertensis leaf extract (SQE) exerts a protective effect against inflammation in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. Therefore, colon tissues of DSS-induced colitis mice that were treated with SQE were assayed for levels of proinflammatory markers, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, and activation of nuclear factor kappaB. For this purpose, mice were pretreated with SQE (100 mg/kg or 300 mg/kg body weight) by gavage for a 2-week period. Mice then received either SQE or sulfasalazine (100 mg/kg body weight) with 2.5% DSS in drinking water for 7 days twice daily and 7 days of tap water ad libitum between DSS treatment. Treatment with SQE was found to attenuate the severity of DSS-induced colitis, as assessed by disease activity index scores, shrinkage of colon length, and histopathologic changes. SQE reduced DSS-induced proliferation in distal colon tissues. It also significantly suppressed levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in serum and colon tissues, nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase, and levels of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinases, p38, extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2, and IkappaBalpha in colon tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that SQE supplementation can exert an anti-inflammatory effect on experimental chronic colitis.},

The goal of the studies was to evaluate the concentrations of MMP-3 and MMP-9, in the sera of children suffering from ulcerative colitis (UC) in relation to disease activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was comprised of 31 children with UC (aged 3-18 years) and 37 children in the control group (aged 1-18 years). Disease activity was estimated using the Truelove-Witts scale. MMP-3 and -9 concentrations were determined using ELISA tests. RESULTS: Median MMP-3 concentrations were 18.4 ng/mL (95% CI: 12.5-24.3) for moderate and severe, 4.35 ng/mL (95% CI: 2.5-7.8) for the mild form of UC and 1.8 ng/mL (95% CI: 1.2-2.5) for the control group. Median MMP-9 concentrations were 18.0 ng/mL (95% CI: 2.83-36.6) for moderate and severe, 1.55 ng/mL (95% CI: 0.4-3.0) for the mild form of UC and 1.3 ng/mL (95% CI: 0.7-1.96) for the control group. Serum MMP-3 and MMP-9 concentrations in the moderate group were higher than those in the mild and control groups (p < 0.001). MMP-3 concentrations in the mild group also differed from those in the control group (p < 0.001). Among the parameters studied (MMP-3, MMP-9, CRP and ESR), MMP-3 had the highest discriminative value (AUC = 0.9, p < 0.001, sensitivity = 71%, specificity = 92%) in distinguishing patients with UC from healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of MMP-3 and MMP-9 concentrations along with the disease activity suggests the possibility of their application in the evaluation of the clinical activity of UC.},

   abstract = {While the etiological underpinnings of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are highly complex, it has been noted that both clinical and pathophysiological similarities exist between IBD and both asthma and non-pulmonary allergic phenomena. In this review, several key points on common biomarkers, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and nutritional and probiotic interventions for both IBD and non-pulmonary allergic diseases are discussed. Histamine and mast cell activity show common behaviors in both IBD and in certain allergic disorders. IgE also represents a key immunoglobulin involved in both IBD and in certain allergic pathologies, though these links require further study. Probiotics remain a critically important intervention for both IBD subtypes as well as multiple allergic phenomena. Linked clinical phenomena, especially sinonasal disease and IBD, are discussed. In addition, nutritional interventions remain an underutilized and promising therapy for modification of both allergic disorders and IBD. Recommending new mothers breastfeed their infants, and increasing the duration of breastfeeding may also help prevent both IBD and allergic diseases, but requires more investigation. While much remains to be discovered, it is clear that non-pulmonary allergic phenomena are connected to IBD in a myriad number of ways and that the discovery of common immunological pathways may usher in an era of vastly improved treatments for patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Colonic dysbiosis contributes to the development of colonic inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC). Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) is being proposed as a novel treatment for UC because it can eliminate dysbiosis; however, no prospective data exist. We initiated a pilot study to evaluate feasibility and safety of FMT in children with UC. METHODS: Ten children, 7 to 21 years of age, with mild-to-moderate UC (pediatric UC activity index [PUCAI] between 15 and 65) received freshly prepared fecal enemas daily for 5 days. Data on tolerability, adverse events, and disease activity were collected during FMT and weekly for 4 weeks after FMT. Clinical response was defined as decrease in PUCAI by >15, and decrease in PUCAI to <10 was considered clinical remission. RESULTS: No serious adverse events were noted. Mild (cramping, fullness, flatulence, bloating, diarrhea, and blood in stool) to moderate (fever) adverse events were self-limiting. One subject could not retain fecal enemas. Average tolerated enema volume by remaining 9 subjects was 165 mL/day. After FMT, 7 of the 9 (78%) subjects showed clinical response within 1 week, 6 of the 9 (67%) subjects maintained clinical response at 1 month, and 3 of the 9 (33%) subjects achieved clinical remission at 1 week after FMT. Median PUCAI significantly improved after FMT (P = 0.03) compared with the baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal enemas were feasible and tolerated by children with UC. Adverse events were acceptable, self-limiting, and manageable by subjects. FMT indicated efficacy in the treatment of UC.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The clinical presentations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) prior to diagnosis are so diverse or vague that many of them waste time before final diagnosis. This study was undertaken to know the medical history of the pediatric patients until the final diagnosis could be reached. METHODS: The medical records of all pediatric patients who were diagnosed with IBD (Crohn's disease [CD] in 14 children, ulcerative colitis [UC] in 17) during the last 13 years were reviewed. We investigated the length of the diagnostic time lag, chief clinical presentation, and any useful laboratory predictor among the routinely performed examinations. Indeterminate colitis was not included. RESULTS: The mean ages of children at the final diagnosis was similar in both diseases. As for the pre-clinical past history of bowel symptoms in CD patients, 5 were previously healthy, 9 had had 1-3 gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, weight loss, bloody stool, anemia and rectal prolapse. With UC, 9 were previously healthy, 8 had had 1-3 GI symptoms, bloody stool, anorexia. The average diagnostic time lag with CD was 3.36 months, and with UC 2.2 months. Body mass index (BMI) and the initial basic laboratory data (white blood cell, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, serum albumin, and serum total protein) were lower in CD, statistically significant only in BMI. CONCLUSION: IBD shows diverse clinical symptoms before its classical features, making the patients waste time until diagnosis. It is important to concern possibility of IBD even in the mildly sick children who do not show the characteristic symptoms of IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The impact of food on relapse in ulcerative colitis has not been clearly defined. The aim of this prospective, randomized-controlled study was to evaluate the impact of comprehensive dietary guidelines on the clinical course of the disease and quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were allocated randomly to an intervention or a control group. Participants in the intervention group were provided dietary guidelines in the form of an educational booklet that was recommended for use for 4-6 weeks during disease flare, that patients eat little and often (four to six times a day), drink adequate fluids, decrease excess intake of fat, decrease simple carbohydrates and decrease high-fibre foods during flare.Validated and study-designed questionnaires were used to compare patients' perceived quality of life, colitis activity scores and eating habits before and following the dietary advice provided. RESULTS: Overall, 112 patients completed the study. Study participants were asked to complete the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index together with the Food Frequency Questionnaire at 0, 6 and 24 weeks. At 24 weeks, there was a mean reduction in the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index score in the intervention group compared with an increase in the score in the control group [-1.304 (P=0.0108) vs. 0.875 (P=0.0249)]. There was a mean increase in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire score in the intervention group compared with a reduction in the score in the control group [7.17 (P=0.126) vs. -3.44 (P=0.205)]. A total of 69% of patients in the intervention group found the dietary advice significantly or moderately helpful. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that there is likely to be a link between the dietary advice provided and symptomatic improvement. The effect of diet may not occur through the addition or the elimination of single nutrients; rather, each food consumed combines many nutrients that allow for a synergistic or an antagonistic action when present in a certain composition.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinicians often evaluate for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) presenting with exacerbations. A highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for the toxin B gene of C difficile is increasingly used to diagnose CDI. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive C difficile PCR results in children and young adults with and without active IBD compared with patients with non-IBD gastrointestinal disease. METHODS: Fecal samples were obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 76) or Crohn disease (CD, n = 69) and 51 controls followed in our gastroenterology program. Samples were analyzed for C difficile using a PCR test for the C difficile toxin B gene (BD GeneOhm Cdiff assay). Proportions of positive tests in each group were compared using the Pearson chi2 test. RESULTS: The prevalence of positive PCR results was 11.6% in patients with CD, 18.4% in patients with UC, and 11.8% in controls (P = 0.25). There were no significant differences in the prevalence of positive C difficile results among patients with IBD with and without active disease or among patients with and without diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: Positive C difficile PCR results occur with similar frequency in patients with IBD with and without active disease and in patients with other gastrointestinal diseases. A positive result in a highly sensitive PCR assay that detects low copy numbers of a toxin gene in C difficile may reflect colonization in a subset of patients with IBD, confounding clinical decision making in managing disease exacerbations.},

These oral manifestations may assist in the diagnosis and the monitoring of disease activity, whilst ignoring them may lead to an inaccurate diagnosis and useless and expensive workups. Indurated tag-like lesions, cobblestoning, and mucogingivitis are the most common specific oral findings encountered in CD cases. Aphthous stomatitis and pyostomatitis vegetans are among non-specific oral manifestations of IBD. In differential diagnosis, side effects of drugs, infections, nutritional deficiencies, and other inflammatory conditions should also be considered. Treatment usually involves managing the underlying intestinal disease. In severe cases with local symptoms, topical and/or systemic steroids and immunosuppressive drugs might be used.},

The results of this workshop are presented in three separate manuscripts. This first section describes the most important mechanisms that contribute to the initiation and progression of intestinal fibrosis in IBD including the cellular and molecular mediators, the extracellular matrix molecules and matrix metalloproteinases/tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases-system, the microbiota products, the role of fat, genetic and epigenetic factors, as well as the currently available experimental models. Furthermore, it identifies unanswered questions in the field of intestinal fibrosis and provides a framework for future research.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Several studies have indicated that plasma citrulline levels reflect the extent of mucosal injury of the small intestine. This study was performed to determine whether plasma citrulline levels correlate with the disease activity in pediatric patients with Crohn disease (CD). METHODS: A total of 63 CD and 23 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were included in this study. Disease severity was assessed by pediatric CD activity index (PCDAI), pediatric UC activity index, simplified endoscopic activity score for CD, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The correlations among these variables and plasma citrulline levels were evaluated. We performed subgroup analysis whether correlations between plasma citrulline levels and disease activity depend on small bowel involvement in patients with CD. RESULTS: The plasma citrulline levels correlated negatively with CRP (r = -0.332, P = 0.008), ESR (r = -0.290, P = 0.022), and PCDAI (r = -0.424, P = 0.001) in patients with CD. The plasma citrulline levels were significantly lower in patients with jejunal involvement than in those without (P = 0.027). In subgroup analysis, patients with CD with jejunal involvement showed significantly negative correlations of plasma citrulline levels with CRP (r = -0.628, P = 0.016) and PCDAI (r = -0.632, P = 0.015); however, patients with CD without jejunal involvement revealed no correlations of plasma citrulline levels with CRP and PCDAI. There were no significant correlations between plasma citrulline levels and simplified endoscopic activity score for CD. There were no significant correlations of plasma citrulline levels with CRP, ESR, and pediatric UC activity index in patients with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma citrulline levels correlated with disease severity as measured by PCDAI, CRP, and ESR in pediatric patients with CD with jejunal involvement.},

We compared the proportion of patients in continuous remission for all recorded visits in each season. We also compared the distribution of all recorded visits with a physician global assessment (PGA) of remission or active disease across seasons. RESULTS: A total of 1325 patients with CD (6102 visits) and 587 patients with UC (2394 visits) were included. The proportion of patients with UC in continuous remission during each season was highest in the summer (67%) and lowest in the winter (55%) (P=0.01). A similar pattern was found for CD but was not significant. Similarly, the proportion of visits in remission was highest in the summer and lowest in the winter for both UC (29%, 21%; P<0.001) and CD (28%, 23%; P<0.001); however, the distribution of visits with active disease was not significantly different across seasons. CONCLUSIONS: The higher proportion of patients with UC in continuous remission in the summer may be related to the higher proportion of remission visits in the summer, because the proportion of visits with active disease was similar across seasons. These findings do not support any strong associations between season of the year and disease activity in pediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thiopurine immunosuppressants such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are widely used to maintain remission in children with both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Therapeutic efficacy is associated with higher red blood cell levels of the thiopurine metabolite 6-thioguanine (6-TGN). Studies in both children and adults have inexplicably failed to demonstrate a significant correlation between prescribed dose and level of 6-TGN. We aimed to quantify the relationship between 6-TGN levels and adherence. METHODS: We used electronic monitoring devices to assess adherence in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel diseases who were prescribed 6-MP. RESULTS: During 3230 days of monitoring in 19 subjects, adherence to 6-MP was 74.2%. Due to the generally low adherence to the prescribed dose of 6-MP, the 6-TGN level was not correlated with the prescribed dose. The 6-TGN level was significantly correlated with the adherence-adjusted dose (R(2) = 0.395). It was also significantly correlated to adherence alone (R(2) = 0.478). Adherence to 5-aminosalicylic acid and 6-MP were significantly positively correlated (r(s)(9) = 0.82, P = 0.00), and a significant relationship was found between 5-aminosalicylic acid adherence and 6-TGN levels independent of 6-MP adherence. Furthermore, low adherence to 6-MP was associated with increased likelihood of escalation of medical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Red blood cell 6-TGN levels are strongly correlated with the dose, when the dose is actually taken. Lack of efficacy of thiopurines may often be the result of poor adherence. Novel ways of assessing and improving adherence are necessary. Future trials should assess adherence in study participants. Intake of 5-aminosalicylic acid positively influences 6-TGN levels.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) include bloody diarrhea, fatigue, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Long-term management of remission for most patients requires adherence to taking 1 or more oral medications daily, in the absence of symptoms. We investigated whether disease characteristics and behavioral characteristics predict adherence to prescribed medical regimens. METHODS: : Patients aged 8 to 17.5 years, newly diagnosed with IBD, and a matched cohort previously diagnosed were studied over a 6-month period. Adherence was assessed using medication electronic monitoring devices (Medication Event Monitoring Systems); participants and parents completed questionnaires regarding emotional and behavioral functioning, and biological parameters were monitored. RESULTS: : Adherence was monitored for 45 newly and 34 previously diagnosed patients. In total, 16,478 patient-days (including 12,066 discrete days) were electronically monitored. Overall, 70.6% of 5-aminosalicylic acid and 65.4% of 6-mercaptopurine doses were taken. Only 25% and 15% of older adolescents took at least 80% of their 5-aminosalicylic acid and 6-mercaptopurine, respectively, compared with about 83% and 64% of 8-year-olds to 11-year-olds. Only age and behavioral issues were statistically linked to rates of adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to commonly prescribed oral medications for IBD is challenging for patients. Screening for emotional and behavioral problems, especially among older adolescents, would be important in identifying patients at risk of poor adherence, who might benefit from interventions. Biological solutions, although critical, when applied without attention to behavioral issues, are not likely to provide the level of therapeutic benefit that can be provided in a combined biobehavioral approach.},

   abstract = {Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two main types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have become increasingly common in Australasian children and adolescents in recent years. Furthermore, CD and UC are seen more often in younger children. These conditions are typically more extensive in children and tend to follow more severe disease courses than in adults. Although many children may present with typical symptoms (such as abdominal pain or bloody diarrhoea), others have atypical features (including oral ulceration, short stature or skin manifestations). In addition, many children with IBD will have altered growth or nutrition, which may compromise normal linear growth and pubertal development. Early identification and full assessment of children presenting with possible IBD are essential to avoid consequences of diagnostic delay and to optimise short- and long-term outcomes. Management of IBD encompasses various options and should be undertaken within a team-based, child and family-focused, multidisciplinary setting.},

   abstract = {Tributyrin (TBT) is a TAG composed of three butyric acids that has beneficial effects on ulcerative colitis due to its trophic, anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic and anti-carcinogenic properties. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of action of TBT supplementation in the prevention of mucosal damage in experimental colitis. Mice received either a control diet or a TBT-supplemented diet for 15 d. Colitis was induced by dextran sodium sulphate administration during the last 7 d. Mucosal damage and the activation of immune cells and cytokines were determined by histological score, flow cytometry and ELISA. Leucocyte rolling and adhesion were assessed by intravital microscopy. Oxidative stress was determined by monitoring hydroperoxide concentration and evaluating superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities. Intestinal permeability was analysed using diethylenetriaminepentaacetate acid (99mTcDTPA). Compared with the colitis group, the animals in the colitis+TBT group had reduced mucosal damage and neutrophil and eosinophil mucosal infiltration, which were associated with a higher percentage of regulatory T cells (Treg) and higher levels of transforming growth factor beta and IL-10 in the lamina propria. The level of in vivo leucocyte adhesion in the colon microvasculature was reduced after TBT supplementation. A lower level of hydroperoxide and higher levels of SOD and catalase activities were associated with TBT supplementation. TBT-supplemented mice showed reduced intestinal permeability to the levels intermediate between the control and colitis groups. In conclusion, the present results show that TBT has positive effects on colonic restructuring in experimental colitis. Additionally, TBT supplementation changes the immune response by controlling inflammation and regulating the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and Treg.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Definitive diagnosis of pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) may be particularly challenging since isolated colitis with overlapping features is common in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD), while atypical phenotypes of UC are not uncommon. The Paris classification allows more accurate phenotyping of atypical inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Our aim was to identify the prevalence of atypical disease patterns in new-onset pediatric UC using the Paris classification. METHODS: Information was collected from the EUROKIDS Registry, an inception cohort of untreated pediatric IBD patients undergoing evaluation at diagnosis. Patients with IBD-unclassified were excluded. Patients with isolated Crohn's colitis served as a control group. RESULTS: Data from 898 pediatric patients (643 UC, 255 CD colitis) were included. Extensive or pancolitis was present in 77% of UC patients and macroscopic rectal sparing in 5%. Rectal sparing was inversely associated with age (mean age with rectal sparing 9.9 years vs. 11.8 without; P = 0.02). Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) involvement occurred in 4% of patients. Erosions in the stomach were present in 3.1% of children, but frank ulcerations in 0.4%; 0.8% of children had erosions or ulcerations limited to the esophagus or duodenum. The corresponding UGI involvement in Crohn's colitis was 22%. A cecal patch occurred in 2% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive disease and rectal sparing are age-dependent phenotypes in pediatric UC. Rectal sparing, cecal patch, backwash ileitis, and gastric erosions are not uncommon at diagnosis, while gastric ulcerations and erosions in the duodenum or esophagus are. Recognition of atypical phenotypes in pediatric-onset UC is crucial to prevent misclassification of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) can be challenging in choosing the most informative diagnostic tests and correctly classifying PIBD into its different subtypes. Recent advances in our understanding of the natural history and phenotype of PIBD, increasing availability of serological and fecal biomarkers, and the emergence of novel endoscopic and imaging technologies taken together have made the previous Porto criteria for the diagnosis of PIBD obsolete. METHODS: We aimed to revise the original Porto criteria using an evidence-based approach and consensus process to yield specific practice recommendations for the diagnosis of PIBD. These revised criteria are based on the Paris classification of PIBD and the original Porto criteria while incorporating novel data, such as for serum and fecal biomarkers. A consensus of at least 80% of participants was achieved for all recommendations and the summary algorithm. RESULTS: The revised criteria depart from existing criteria by defining 2 categories of ulcerative colitis (UC, typical and atypical); atypical phenotypes of UC should be treated as UC. A novel approach based on multiple criteria for diagnosing IBD-unclassified (IBD-U) is proposed. Specifically, these revised criteria recommend upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and ileocolonscopy for all suspected patients with PIBD, with small bowel imaging (unless typical UC after endoscopy and histology) by magnetic resonance enterography or wireless capsule endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: These revised Porto criteria for the diagnosis of PIBD have been developed to meet present challenges and developments in PIBD and provide up-to-date guidelines for the definition and diagnosis of the IBD spectrum.},

Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D is characterized by febrile attacks, often associated with transient digestive manifestations, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Here we report for the first time 2 patients with MKD revealed by severe neonatal colitis. Both patients had chronic bloody diarrhea and failure to thrive; 1 patient since the age of 1 month and the other since the age of 12 days. Total parenteral nutrition was required. A marked elevation of acute phase reactants was present, and no evidence of infection was found. In patient 1, ileocolonoscopy revealed ulcerative colitis at the age of 5 months. Patient 2 suffered from enterocolitis and shock, associated with multiple bowel adhesions at age 5 weeks; the rectosigmoidoscopy showed aphtoid lesions of the sigmoid colon. Pathologic findings of colonic biopsies revealed a dense polymorph inflammatory infiltrate associated with deep ulcerations. Febrile attacks occurred 2 months after the onset of digestive symptoms in patient 1, and at onset of disease in patient 2. Genomic sequencing of the mevalonate kinase gene revealed compound heterozygous mutations in both patients. Anti-interleukin-1 agent produced long-term remission of all digestive features and laboratory parameters. This report emphasizes that MKD may be the cause of severe early-onset inflammatory colitis, and must be considered by physicians, even in the absence of fever, after ruling out infections. Anti-interleukin-1 therapy may result in a dramatic improvement of MKD-related inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic debilitating diseases that occur in populations around the world. The underlying etiology is thought to be multifactorial. There is a well-defined genetic contribution to the diseases, but this does not fully explain the epidemiology. Environmental factors, including the composition of the gut microbiota, are also important. There is wide geographic variability in the incidence and prevalence of IBD. High incidence rates have been observed in the United Kingdom, Northern Europe, Canada, and the United States. Globally, there is evidence of increasing incidence of CD and UC over time. The rising incidence of IBD in Western countries has generally predated that in developing nations, supporting the hypothesis that 'Westernization' of our lifestyle has led to the increased incidence of IBD. Smoking, antibiotic use, and diet are potentially reversible risk factors for IBD. Recommendations to avoid smoking are appropriate for all people, for numerous reasons. Antibiotic use should be limited to appropriate indications, a recommendation that too is appropriate for all populations. Detangling the relationship between diet, the gut microbiome and IBD raises the potential to reduce the incidence of IBD through dietary modification, an approach that might be considered among those at the highest risk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mesenteric fat plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD), and a higher ratio of visceral fat area (VFA) to subcutaneous fat area (SFA) is related to complicated disease status. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective treatment option for patients with CD, and the aims of this study were to assess the effects of EEN on abdominal fat in patients with CD. METHODS: Patient data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. The SFA and VFA were measured in 38 patients with CD before and after 8-week EEN therapy, and the mesenteric fat index (MFI), defined as the ratio of VFA to SFA, was calculated. The correlations between MFI and CD activity index and C-reactive protein level were also evaluated. RESULTS: The median age of the patients in our study was 29 years, and the median duration of disease was 3.05 years. Both VFA (P = 0.029) and MFI (P = 0.021) were significantly decreased in patients after EEN, but no significant change was observed in SFA (P = 0.335). MFI was significantly correlated with CD activity index (r = 0.523, P = 0.001) and C-reactive protein (r = 0.634, P < 0.0001) in patients with active CD before EEN, although no positive correlations were observed in patients after EEN treatment. CONCLUSIONS: EEN induction therapy was associated with a significant decrease in VFA in patients with CD, and MFI was significantly correlated with CD activity index and C-reactive protein in active CD. Thus, our data reveal additional beneficial therapeutic mechanisms of enteral nutrition treatment in CD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation, and it can modulate immune response. In this work, we asked whether levels of either TGF-beta1 or mRNA of the corresponding gene in plasma or tissue can be useful in diagnosing and/or monitoring of the clinical course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). METHODS: The study group consisted of 104 pediatric patients with IBD: 36 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 68 with ulcerative colitis (UC); 42 children represented the control group. TGF-beta1 levels in plasma and intestinal mucosa were estimated by ELISA and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. Levels of TGF-beta1 mRNA were determined by reverse transcription and real-time PCR. RESULTS: In patients with IBD, and in subgroups with CD and UC, no significant differences in the TGF-beta1 level in plasma and tissue were found relative to the control group. These variables were not dependent on the stage of the disease, its activity or severity of endoscopic and histopathological findings. TGF-beta1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in tissue samples withdrawn during the relapse of the disease than in those taken during the remission or in the control group. However, no correlation between TGF-beta1 plasma levels and TGF-beta1 mRNA amount in the intestinal mucosa was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The TGF-beta1 mRNA level, but not the amount of the gene product, was significantly increased in the pathologically changed tissue during the relapse of IBD. We suggest that this parameter might be considered as a potential prognostic value when assessing IBD in children.},

IBD has been reported an increased prevalence of low bone mass. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the nutritional status and to investigate the correlation between bone mineral density (BMD) and nutrient factors in patients with IBD. METHODS: A total of 41 subjects were classified into normal group (n=21) and malnourished group (n=20) by the subjective global assessment result. We surveyed the dietary habit, nutrient intake, and BMD. RESULTS: Subjects' average age was 36.7 years old, and included 26 ulcerative colitis and 15 Crohn's disease. The serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher and serum calcium was significantly lower in the malnourished group. Lower bone density subjects were more in the malnourished group but no significant difference. Intake of energy, protein, carbohydrate, fiber, iron, sodium, potassium, zinc, vitamin B6, vitamin C and folate were significantly lower in the malnourished group. The BMD of malnourished group showed correlation with triceps skin fold thickness (TSF), CRP, dietary calcium, phosphorous, iron, animal iron, zinc and vitamin. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that adequate intake of nutrients is important to prevent bone loss and systemic education programs are need for IBD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) diagnosis requires comprehensive examination of the patient. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Escherichia coli have been reported as representatives of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) dysbiosis. The aim was to determine whether or not quantification of these species can be used as a complementary tool either for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. METHODS: Mucosa-associated F. prausnitzii and E. coli abundance was determined in 28 controls (H), 45 CD, 28 UC patients and 10 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subjects by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the F. prausnitzii-E. coli index (F-E index) was calculated. Species abundances were normalized to total bacteria and human cells. Data was analyzed taking into account patients' phenotype and most relevant clinical characteristics. RESULTS: IBD patients had lower F. prausnitzii abundance than H and IBS (P<0.001). CD patients showed higher E. coli counts than H and UC patients (P<0.001). The F-E index discriminated between H, CD and UC patients, and even between disease phenotypes that are usually difficult to distinguish as ileal-CD (I-CD) from ileocolonic-CD and colonic-CD from extensive colitis. E. coli increased in active CD patients, and remission in I-CD patients was compromised by high abundance of this species. Treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha diminished E. coli abundance in I-CD whereas none of the treatments counterbalanced F. prausnitzii depletion. CONCLUSION: F. prausnitzii and E. coli are useful indicators to assist in IBD phenotype classification. The abundance of these species could also be used as a supporting prognostic tool in I-CD patients. Our data indicates that current medication does not restore the levels of these two species to those found in a healthy gut.},

   abstract = {The vast majority of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will receive immunosuppressive therapy at some point for their disease, whether for the short term (such as a course of corticosteroids) or long term (such as maintenance therapy with immunomodulators or biologics). The systemic immunosuppression places patients at increased risk for infections. Therefore, it is important that patients are up-to-date with immunizations to minimize vaccine-preventable infections. However, the literature shows that the rate of immunization in patients with IBD is low. Ideally, the vaccination status is checked at diagnosis, and patients are immunized with the vaccines they need. Drawing titers is helpful in cases in which vaccination history is unclear or to confirm that titers are at an adequate level in cases in which patients have been vaccinated. Current guidelines recommend that patients with IBD follow the same routine immunization schedule as healthy children, but patients should not be administered live vaccines if they are receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, it is ideal to administer any necessary vaccinations as early as possible, prior to starting immunosuppressive therapy. Patients may receive inactivated vaccines regardless of immunosuppressive status. The IBD literature suggests that inactivated vaccines are safe and do not worsen disease activity. In general, patients with IBD mount an immune response to vaccines, but the response may be lower if patients are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, especially tumor necrosis factor inhibitors.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a risk factor for the development of colon cancer. Environmental factors including diet and the microflora influence disease outcome. Folate and homocysteine have been associated with IBD-mediated colon cancer but their roles remain unclear. We used a model of chemically induced ulcerative colitis (dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)) with or without the colon carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) to determine the impact of dietary folic acid (FA) on colonic microflora and the development of colon tumours. Male mice (n 15 per group) were fed a FA-deficient (0 mg/kg), control (2 mg/kg) or FA-supplemented (8 mg/kg) diet for 12 weeks. Folate status was dependent on the diet (P< 0.001) and colitis-induced treatment (P= 0.04) such that mice with colitis had lower circulating folate. FA had a minimal effect on tumour initiation, growth and progression, although FA-containing diets tended to be associated with a higher tumour prevalence in DSS-treated mice (7-20 v. 0%, P= 0.08) and the development of more tumours in the distal colon of AOM-treated mice (13-83% increase, P= 0.09). Folate deficiency was associated with hyperhomocysteinaemia (P< 0.001) but homocysteine negatively correlated with tumour number (r - 0.58, P= 0.02) and load (r - 0.57, P= 0.02). FA had no effect on the intestinal microflora. The present data indicate that FA intake has no or little effect on IBD or IBD-mediated colon cancer in this model and that hyperhomocysteinaemia is a biomarker of dietary status and malabsorption rather than a cause of IBD-mediated colon cancer.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Bacteria play an important role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Unlike in Crohn's disease (CD), in which dysbiosis has been better characterised, in ulcerative colitis (UC), only small cohorts have been studied and showed conflicting data. Therefore, we evaluated in a large cohort if the microbial signature described in CD is also present in UC, and if we could characterise predominant dysbiosis in UC. To assess the functional impact of dysbiosis, we quantified the bacterial metabolites. DESIGN: The predominant microbiota from 127 UC patients and 87 age and sex-matched controls was analysed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Differences were quantitatively validated using real-time PCR. Metabolites were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Based on DGGE analysis, the microbial signature previously described in CD was not present in UC. Real-time PCR analysis revealed a lower abundance of Roseburia hominis (p<0.0001) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p<0.0001) in UC patients compared to controls. Both species showed an inverse correlation with disease activity. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were reduced in UC patients (p=0.014), but no direct correlation between SCFA and the identified bacteria was found. CONCLUSIONS: The composition of the fecal microbiota of UC patients differs from that of healthy individuals: we found a reduction in R hominis and F prausnitzii, both well-known butyrate-producing bacteria of the Firmicutes phylum. These results underscore the importance of dysbiosis in IBD but suggest that different bacterial species contribute to the pathogenesis of UC and CD.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES: Focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates are found in the upper gastrointestinal involvement of Crohn's disease, and may reflect an underlying defective innate immunity. These features, however, are also described in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection. The role of these gastric abnormalities in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease was assessed in a population with high prevalence of H. pylori infection. METHODS: Thirty-seven Crohn's disease, 26 ulcerative colitis, and 30 control patients were included. The H. pylori status was evaluated by the rapid urease test and histology. The presence of focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates was recorded. RESULTS: Focally enhanced gastritis was present in 24% of Crohn's disease patients, 4% of ulcerative colitis patients and 11.5% of controls, presenting an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn's disease of 24% and 88%, respectively. Macrophage microaggregates were found in all groups, but were only detected in ulcerative colitis and controls in association with H. pylori infection, with an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn's disease of 61% and 69%, respectively. In the absence of H. pylori infection, focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates were significantly associated with Crohn's disease (P<0.02 and P = 0.001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Focally gastritis and macrophage microaggregates are suggestive of Crohn's disease only in H. pylori-negative specimens.},

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to determine early effects of infliximab therapy on T cells in the blood of UC patients and if effects differed in therapy responders and nonresponders. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained before and two weeks post-treatment start from 34 anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy-naive UC patients undergoing infliximab therapy. Response to therapy was evaluated prior to the fourth treatment dose. Expression of T cell surface markers and levels of soluble receptors and cytokines in serum were determined. RESULTS: At baseline, there were no differences in cellular, biochemical or clinical parameters between therapy responders and nonresponders. Infliximab therapy reduced frequencies of CD25(+) T cells and increased frequencies of annexin V(+) T cells in patients responding to infliximab, but not in nonresponding patients, two weeks after therapy start. Only therapy responders had decreased serum levels of sCD25 and sTNFRII two weeks after treatment start. In contrast, clinical parameters did not reflect therapy outcome already two weeks after therapy start. CONCLUSION: Soluble and membrane-bound T cell receptors may be early indicators of infliximab therapy response in UC, which can be of clinical importance for the decision when to continue or to stop the treatment.},

We therefore investigated early effects of infliximab therapy on monocytes and associated chemokines linked to clinical therapy response in UC patients. METHODS: Blood and biopsies were obtained from anti-TNF therapy-naive UC patients (n = 43) before (baseline) and during induction therapy with infliximab. Therapy response was evaluated at Week 14. Expression of monocyte activation markers and levels of chemokines in serum and biopsies were determined. Quantitative proteomic analysis was performed in cultured mucosal biopsies, and obtained data was validated in serum. RESULTS: In therapy responders, but not in non-responders, infliximab reduced blood monocyte expression of CD14 and CD86, 2 weeks after therapy commenced, relative to baseline. Serum CCL2 levels were decreased only among therapy responders at Week 2 and Week 14, relative to baseline. These data corresponded with lower levels of CD14, CD86 and CCL2 in intestinal tissue in responders as compared with non-responders at Week 14. Proteomic analysis of cultured biopsies showed that infliximab induced a reduction in Tenascin C that predicted downregulation of CCL2. Therapy responders, but not non-responders, had decreased serum Tenascin C levels at Week 2 and Week 14, relative to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab therapy response in UC patients is associated with reduced monocyte activation and serum levels of CCL2 2 weeks after therapy commencement. In therapy responders, infliximab influenced Tenascin C, which might be a regulator of CCL2 expression and important for induction of the clinical therapy response.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Health-related quality of life (HRQL) is not well studied in proctocolectomy patients with pediatric onset of ulcerative colitis (UC). We aimed to (1) compare the HRQL of proctocolectomy patients with those treated with conventional therapy and (2) determine factors that influence HRQL in UC patients < 18 years. METHODS: Chart review was done on patients diagnosed with pediatric onset of UC (<18) at the Stollery Children's Hospital. HRQL was evaluated in 88 patients using disease- and age-specific questionnaires; IMPACT III (<18) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ; >/=18). Demographics, disease characteristics, disease index (PUCAI), HRQL EuroQoL visual analog scale (EQ-5D/VAS) were collected and analyzed from all patients. RESULTS: Sixty-five respondents completed the IMPACT III (74 %) and 23 patients completed the IBDQ (26 %). Thirty-three surgical patients (34 %) responded (mean IMPACT III score = 148.9 +/- 12.7; mean IBDQ = 171.2 +/- 40.1). There was no significant difference in IMPACT III scores of surgical patients vs. medically treated patients (148.9 +/- 12.7 vs. 140.6 +/- 19.4, p = 0.09). Patients with high IMPACT scores (>143 points) were most likely to be in remission (p = 0.05), they were less likely to be on medication (p < 0.05), have parent/guardian with postsecondary education (p = 0.01), did not suffer from fatigue (p < 0.01), and did not report depression (p < 0.02). The IMPACT correlation with PUCAI (adjusted r (2) = 0.33) and EQ-VAS (adjusted r (2) = 0.45) was strong. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical patients reported to have a HRQL comparable to or better than the nonsurgical patients. Depression, fatigue, parent/guardian education, and drugs influence HRQL.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A sharp increase in paediatric (younger than 16 years) inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) incidence was observed in northern Stockholm County, Sweden, in 1990-2001. The increasing incidence was primarily explained by a rising incidence of Crohn disease (CD). Here, we present an update on the trends in incidence of paediatric IBD, 2002-2007. METHOD: Medical records of all children diagnosed as having suspected IBD in northern Stockholm County, 2002-2007, were scrutinised using defined diagnostic criteria. Disease extension, localisation, and behaviour at diagnosis were classified within the framework of the Paris classification. RESULT: A total of 133 children were diagnosed as having IBD 2002-2007 corresponding to a sex- and age-standardised incidence (per 10 person-years) for paediatric IBD of 12.8 (95% CI 10.8-15.2). The standardised incidence was 9.2 (95% CI 7.5-11.2) for CD and 2.8 (95% CI 1.9-4.0) for ulcerative colitis (UC). A significant increasing incidence of UC (P < 0.05) was observed during the study period. No temporal trend was observed for the incidence of CD. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rate of paediatric IBD in northern Stockholm was significantly higher in 2002-2007 than that observed in our earlier study covering 1990-2001. The former sharp increase in incidence of paediatric CD seems, however, to have levelled out, although at a higher rate than reported from most other regions in the world. Although CD was still predominant, the observed increase in incidence of UC during the study period is notable.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis are chronic intestinal disorders, which are on the increase in "Westernised" countries. IBD can be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that has been identified as being involved in several diseases including IBD. Studies have shown that polymorphisms in the promoter region reduce serum levels of IL-10 and this reduction has been associated with some forms of IBD. Mouse models have shown promising results with IL-10 supplementation, as such IL-10 supplementation has been touted as being a possible alternative treatment for CD in humans. Clinical trials have shown that recombinant human IL-10 is safe and well tolerated up to a dose of 8 mug/kg. However, to date, the results of the clinical trials have been disappointing. Although CD activity was reduced as measured by the CD activity index, IL-10 supplementation did not result in significantly reduced remission rates or clinical improvements when compared to placebo. This review discusses why IL-10 supplementation is not effective in CD patients currently and what can be addressed to potentially make IL-10 supplementation a more viable treatment option in the future. Based on the current research we conclude that IL-10 supplementation is not a one size fits all treatment and if the correct population of patients is chosen then IL-10 supplementation could be of benefit.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) diagnosis has increased in the last decades in Spain, there are no consistent epidemiologic data. Our aim was to describe the changing pattern of pediatric IBD incidence in Spain in the last 14 years. METHODS: A retrospective survey of patients diagnosed below 18 years of age in the period 1996-2009 was performed. Patients' data were obtained from the hospitals' databases. To avoid reduced accrual of cases diagnosed by adult physicians, adult IBD units in referral centers were invited to participate. Seventy-eight centers participated in our survey. Rates of incidence were calculated using age-stratified population-based epidemiologic data. Incidence rates were compared for the last 14 years (1996-2009). RESULTS: In total, data from 2107 patients were obtained: 1,165 Crohn's disease (CD, 55.3%), 788 ulcerative colitis (UC, 37.4%), and 154 IBD unclassified. The sex distribution was 56.4% male, with higher predominance for CD (59.3%) as compared to UC (52.8%) and IBD unclassified (53.2%) (P = 0.012). The median age at diagnosis was 12.3 years (p25-75 9.7-14.6) with significant differences between diseases. IBD incidence increased from 0.97 to 2.8/100,000 inhabitants <18 years/year in the study period. Although this increase is more evident for CD (from 0.53 to 1.7), UC has also risen considerably (0.39 to 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first attempt to calculate the current incidence of pediatric IBD in Spain. A significant increase of incidence rates in the study period was observed. In the last 14 years pediatric IBD incidence has almost tripled, with a more important CD increase.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A growing incidence of pediatric IBD (PIBD) in southern Europe has been recently reported. The SPIRIT registry (1996-2009) confirmed these tendencies in Spain. Our aim is to obtain data from 1985 to 1995 and describe the complete picture of PIBD presentation changes in Spain in the last 25years. METHODS: A retrospective survey of incident PIBD in the period 1985-1995 was performed. Patients' data were obtained from the hospitals' databases and compared with the published data from the 1996 to 2009 period. Seventy-eight IBD reference centers took part in this survey. RESULTS: Data from 495 patients were obtained: 278 CD (56.2%), 198 UC (40%), and 19 IBDU (3.8%); 51.7% were female, with higher predominance both in UC (58.6%) and in IBDU (57.9%), but not in CD (46.4%). Median (IQR) age at diagnosis was 12.9 (10.0-15.7) years, with significant differences among IBD subtypes: CD: 13.1 (10.8-16.0) vs UC: 12.4 (9.4-15.1) vs IBDU: 7.5 (3.0-13.0) (p</=0.001). These results are significantly different to the ones in the SPIRIT registry, with a higher proportion of IBDU, younger age and male predominance. The data from both periods taken together give a complete picture of a 25-year period. An annual increase of incident patients was observed, with a ten-fold increase over this period. CONCLUSION: These data extend the epidemiological trends to a full 25-year period (1985-2009). PIBD incidence in Spain has experienced a sixteen-fold increase. The IBD subtype, localization of the affected segment, age- and sex distribution observed are in accordance with our previously published ones of 1996-2009.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a relapsing inflammatory disorder of unconfirmed aetiology, variable severity and clinical course, characterised by progressive histological inflammation and with elevation of eicosanoids which have a known pathophysiological role in inflammation. Therapeutic interventions targetting eicosanoids (5-aminosalicylates (ASA)) are effective first line and adjunctive treatments in mild-moderate UC for achieving and sustaining clinical remission. However, the variable clinical response to 5-ASA and frequent deterioration in response to cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors, has prompted an in depth simultaneous evaluation of multiple lipid mediators (including eicosanoids) within the inflammatory milieu in UC. We hypothesised that severity of inflammation is associated with alteration of lipid mediators, in relapsing UC. DESIGN: Study was case-control design. Mucosal lipid mediators were determined by LC-MS/MS lipidomics analysis on mucosal biopsies taken from patients attending outpatients with relapsing UC. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to investigate the association of mucosal lipid mediators, with the disease state and severity graded histologically. RESULTS: Levels of PGE2, PGD2, TXB2, 5-HETE, 11-HETE, 12-HETE and 15-HETE are significantly elevated in inflamed mucosa and correlate with severity of inflammation, determined using validated histological scoring systems. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach of capturing inflammatory mediator signature at different stages of UC by combining comprehensive lipidomics analysis and computational modelling could be used to classify and predict mild-moderate inflammation; however, predictive index is diminished in severe inflammation. This new technical approach could be developed to tailor drug treatments to patients with active UC, based on the mucosal lipid mediator profile.},

   abstract = {Since the introduction of biological therapy, endoscopic and histological remission, i.e. mucosal healing, has become an important therapeutic goal in Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Mucosal healing is associated with lower rates of hospitalization and surgery, although its role in preventing progression and changing the natural history of the disease has not been clearly demonstrated. A precise definition of mucosal healing has not yet been established, although the concept used in clinical trials is the "complete absence of all inflammatory and ulcerative lesions in all segments of gut" at endoscopy. This definition does not include mucosal improvement and does not distinguish among grades of mucosal healing. In both Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis trials, several qualitative and quantitative numeric endoscopic indices have been proposed to measure and distinguish endoscopic changes. In addition, the microscopic features associated with inflammatory bowel diseases are considerably modified by the course of the disease and the treatments adopted. However, it is not yet clear whether microscopic healing should be a primary endpoint in clinical trials. In this paper we discuss endoscopic and histological findings and the limitations of the endoscopic and histological indices as a basis for a standardised diagnosis of mucosal healing.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) in children is frequently severe and treatment-refractory. While medical therapy is well standardized, little is known regarding factors that contribute to surgical indications. Our aim was to identify factors associated with progression to colectomy in a large cohort of pediatric UC patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Health Information System database. We identified all patients under age 18 discharged between January 1, 2004 and September 30, 2011 with a primary diagnosis of UC. Primary outcome was odds of total colectomy. RESULTS: Of 8,688 patients, 240 (2.8 %) underwent colectomy. Compared with non-operative patients, a greater proportion of colectomy patients received advanced therapies during admission, including corticosteroids (84.2 vs. 71.3 %) and biological therapy (25.4 vs. 13.6 %). Odds of colectomy were increased with malnutrition (OR 1.86), anemia (OR 2.17), electrolyte imbalance (OR 2.31), and Clostridium difficile infection (OR 1.69). TPN requirement also independently predicted colectomy (OR 3.86). Each successive UC admission significantly increased the odds of colectomy (OR 1.08). CONCLUSION: These data identify factors associated with progression to colectomy in children hospitalized with UC. Our findings help to identify factors that should be incorporated into future studies aiming to reduce the variability in surgical treatment of childhood UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) is an established treatment modality for moderate to severe pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). The purpose of this study was to identify clinical and laboratory parameters, which predict response to IFX in pediatric UC defined by colectomy as the primary outcome measure. Postsurgical complications were examined as well. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on children younger than 19 years who received IFX therapy at Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas for the treatment of UC from January 2005 to April 2012. Demographics, laboratory data, clinical subtype, duration of disease, transfusion requirement, number of IFX infusions, concurrent medications, and postoperative complication with regard to IFX exposure were examined. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (22 male and 25 female; average age at diagnosis: 11.4 y) received IFX. Twenty-six (55.3%) required colectomy, 20 (42.6%) of which occurred within a year of therapy initiation. Disease duration <20 months before IFX initiation, increased the likelihood of a colectomy within a year [OR: 3.8 (95% CI, 1.6-13.3), P=0.044]. Blood transfusion requirement before IFX was associated with higher rates of colectomy within a year [OR: 9.78 (95% CI, 2.2-43.3), P=0.0028]. Preoperative exposure to IFX within 8 weeks did not significantly increase postoperative complications (P=0.26). Serum albumin levels at diagnosis did not predict colectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Shorter disease duration and need for blood transfusion may be useful indicators of limited response to IFX in pediatric UC.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence, baseline disease characteristics, and disease location based on the Paris classification in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the Hungarian nationwide inception cohort. In addition, 1-year follow-up with therapy was analyzed. METHODS: From January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009, newly diagnosed pediatric patients with IBD were prospectively registered. Twenty-seven pediatric gastroenterology centers participated in the data collection ensuring the data from the whole country. Newly diagnosed patients with IBD younger than 18 years were reported. Disease location was classified according to the Paris classification. RESULTS: A total of 420 patients were identified. The incidence rate of pediatric IBD was 7.48/10(5) (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.34/10(5)-8.83/10(5)). The incidence for Crohn disease (CD) was 4.72/10(5) (95% CI 3.82-5.79), for ulcerative colitis (UC) 2.32/10(5) (95% CI 1.71-3.09), and for IBD-unclassified 0.45/10(5) (95% CI 0.22-0.84). Most common location in CD was L3 (58.7%); typical upper gastrointestinal abnormalities (ulcer, erosion and aphthous lesion) were observed in 29.9%. Extensive colitis in patients with UC (E4, proximal to hepatic flexure) was the most common disease phenotype (57%), whereas only 5% of children had proctitis. A total of 18.6% of patients had ever severe disease (S1). Frequency of azathioprine administration at diagnosis was 29.5% in patients with CD, and this rate increased to 54.6% (130/238) at 1-year follow-up. In UC, only 3.3% received azathioprine initially, and this rate elevated to 22.5% (25/111). Use of corticosteroid decreased from 50% to 15.3% in patients with UC. Rate of bowel resection in patients with CD during the first year of follow-up was 5%. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pediatric IBD in Hungary was among the higher range reported. This is the first large, nationwide incident cohort analyzed according to the Paris classification, which is a useful tool to determine the characteristic pediatric CD phenotype.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Multiple characteristics of industrialization have been proposed to contribute to the global emergence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs: Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis). Major changes in eating habits during the last decades and the effectiveness of exclusive enteral nutrition in the treatment of Crohn disease indicate the etiologic importance of dietary intake in IBDs. A uniform characteristic of nutrition in developing countries (where the incidence of IBD is low) and exclusive enteral nutrition is their consistent nature for prolonged periods; however, the potentially beneficial effect of dietary monotony in respect to mammalian intestinal inflammation has not been examined. METHODS: The association between alternating (2 different complete chows) and persistent regular diets, and dextran sulfate sodium colitis susceptibility in C57BL/6J mice was studied. Colonic mucosal microbiota changes were investigated by high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. RESULTS: The severity of colitis increased upon dietary alternation compared with consistent control feeding. The microbiota of the alternating nutritional group clustered discretely from both control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that monotonous dietary intake may decrease mammalian vulnerability against colitis in association with microbiota separation. The epidemiologic and therapeutic implications of our results are also discussed.},

   abstract = {The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) include Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis. The disease may present at any age although the peak of presentation is the second and third decades of life. The incidences of these diseases are increasing around the world with the age of presentation getting younger. At present CD is incurable with colectomy being the treatment for severe UC. Although several pharmacological approaches are used to modulate the inflammatory response in IBD, few lead to histological healing and most have side effects. An alternative approach is to use enteral formulae given exclusively (EEN) to treat IBD. EEN requires the consumption of an elemental or polymeric formula, with the exclusion of all other nutrients, for a period of up to 12 weeks. The introduction of EEN as a therapeutic option for IBD was through prudent observation; however, EEN has become an established and reliable option for the treatment of paediatric IBD. Despite this, the mechanisms through which EEN induces disease remission are unknown and remain hypothetical. This review will discuss recent research into EEN both describing clinical features of EEN therapy and discussing the most up-to-date understanding of the mechanisms through which EEN may be reducing intestinal inflammation and inducing disease remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) occurring during childhood is generally extensive and is associated with severe flares that may require intravenous steroid treatment. In cases of corticosteroid resistance is necessary to introduce a second-line treatment to avoid or delay surgery. AIMS: To describe the efficacy and safety of oral tacrolimus for the treatment of severe steroid-resistant UC. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study that included all patients under age 18 suffering from severe steroid-resistant UC treated with oral tacrolimus during the period January 1998 to October 2012 and with a follow-up period after treatment of 24 months or more. RESULTS: A total of ten patients were included. The age at baseline was 9.4+/-4.9 years, and the time from diagnosis was 1.3 months (IQR, 1-5.7). Seven of the patients were in their first flare of disease. All of them received an oral dose of 0.12 mg/kg/day of tacrolimus divided in two doses. Trough plasma levels of tacrolimus were maintained between 4 and 13 ng/ml. Response was seen in 5/10 patients at 12 months, colectomy was eventually performed in 60% of patients during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Tacrolimus is useful in inducing remission in patients with severe steroid-resistant UC, preventing or delaying colectomy, and allowing the patient and family to prepare for a probable surgery. Tacrolimus may also be used as a treatment bridge for corticosteroid-dependent patients until the new maintenance therapy takes effect.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is defined as a chronic inflammatory condition causing continuous mucosal inflammation of the colon without granulomas on biopsy. It affects the rectum, and, to a variable extent, the colon in continuity and is characterized by a relapsing and remitting course. Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) regimens are recommended as first-line induction therapy for mild to moderately active pediatric UC and for maintenance of remission regardless of other initial treatments. In large clinical trials in adults, mesalamine intolerance was found in 2-5 % of the patients. We present a case of an 8-year-old female patient with intolerance to mesalamine and proctitis resistant to conventional therapy who responded to rectal tacrolimus treatment. The patient started with a dose of 2 mg/day at night with an excellent response. She reported feeling better than any of the previously prescribed treatments and without feeling the discomfort of previously administered enemas. After four weeks of treatment, the dose was reduced to 2 mg/week with no relapses. Tacrolimus suppositories were very well tolerated, and no adverse effects have been reported. Although only very little data has been published, rectal tacrolimus seems to be safe and of efficacy in ulcerative proctitis resistant to standard therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cyclosporine and infliximab (IFX) are effective medical therapies for inducing remission in patients with steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis (UC). Patients with acute severe disease who do not respond to these therapies require colectomy, however, the risk of postoperative complications in such patients is not known. Analyzing patients with acute severe UC, we compared the incidence of postoperative complications in patients who failed rescue therapy with cyclosporine or IFX with that in patients who received intravenous (IV) corticosteroids alone. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of UC patients who underwent colectomy after inpatient treatment with cyclosporine plus IV corticosteroids (CsA+IVS), infliximab plus IV corticosteroids (IFX+IVS), or IV corticosteroids alone (IVS) at the University of Chicago Hospitals from October 1, 2006 to October 1, 2012. Primary endpoints were infectious, noninfectious, and total complications occurring within 30 days of colectomy. RESULTS: Of 78 patients, 19 were treated with CsA+IVS, 24 with IFX+IVS, 4 with both CsA and IFX+IVS, and 31 with IVS alone. Patients treated with rescue therapy plus IVS had no difference in total postoperative complications compared with those receiving IVS alone (CsA+IVS: relative risk (RR) = 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.33-1.23; IFX+IVS: RR = 0.65, 95% CI, 0.36-1.17). There remained no difference in postoperative complications between the rescue therapy and IVS alone groups when subcategorizing overall complications into infectious (CsA+IVS: RR = 0.54, 95% CI, 0.17-1.76; IFX+IVS: RR = 0.86, 95% CI, 0.36-2.09) and noninfectious (CsA+IVS: RR = 0.88, 95% CI, 0.43-1.80; IFX+IVS: RR = 0.40, 95% CI, 0.15-1.07) causes. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclosporine and IFX are not associated with an increased risk for postoperative complications in patients hospitalized for severe UC refractory to corticosteroids.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are susceptible to protein-calorie malnutrition secondary to decreased oral intake, malabsorption, and increased metabolic expenditure. In this study, we seek to assess the national frequencies of parenteral nutrition (PN) use among hospitalized patients with IBD and to determine their in-hospital outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1988-2006 to determine the frequency of PN usage among patients with UC or CD and to determine their in-hospital outcomes. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of increased inpatient mortality in this population. RESULTS: From 1988-2006, the annual incidence of PN use among hospitalized patients with CD was 4.29 per 100,000 and among those with UC was 3.80 per 100,000, with trends being relatively stable through the indexed period. The mean length of hospitalization among patients with UC receiving PN was longer compared with patients with CD. Factors predictive of an increased risk for mortality include the following: age >50 years, acute kidney injury, hospital-acquired pneumonia, Clostridium difficile colitis, prolonged postoperative ileus requiring PN use, pulmonary embolism, malnutrition, and patients with UC relative to CD. CONCLUSION: Traditionally, patients with CD are at a higher risk for developing malnutrition than patients with UC; however, there is a 2-fold higher risk for inpatient mortality and a longer length of hospitalization among patients with UC compared with those with CD. This pattern suggests that the use of PN, particularly among patients with UC, serves as a surrogate marker of higher disease acuity and severity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Guidelines for the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) from the American College of Chest Physicians do not address patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a group with a high risk of both VTE and gastrointestinal bleeding. We present recommendations for the prevention and treatment of VTE in patients with IBD. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies on VTE in IBD. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an iterative online platform, then finalized and voted on by a working group of adult and pediatric gastroenterologists and thrombosis specialists. RESULTS: IBD patients have an approximately 3-fold higher risk of VTE compared with individuals without IBD, and disease flares further increase this risk. Anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is recommended for IBD patients who are hospitalized with IBD flares without active bleeding and is suggested when bleeding is nonsevere. Anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is suggested during moderate-severe IBD flares in outpatients with a history of VTE provoked by an IBD flare or an unprovoked VTE, but not otherwise. The recommended duration of anticoagulation after a first VTE is based on the presence of provoking factors. Specific suggestions are made for the prevention and treatment of VTE in pediatric and pregnant IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Using the American College of Chest Physicians' guidelines as a foundation, we have integrated evidence from IBD studies to develop specific recommendations for the management of VTE in this high-risk population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metabolite monitoring and response predictors to azathioprine (AZA) in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are debatable. In an attempt to optimize thiopurine therapy and understand the mechanism of action of thiopurines, we correlated metabolites and other factors with AZA efficacy in children with IBD. METHODS: Data from 86 children with IBD with 440 metabolite measurements were retrospectively analyzed using multilevel logistic regression analyses. A therapeutic response was defined as a pediatric Crohn's disease activity index </=10 for Crohn's disease or a pediatric ulcerative colitis activity index </=10 for ulcerative colitis without any treatment with steroids, antitumor necrosis factor, other immunomodulators, or exclusive enteral nutrition. RESULTS: The 6-thioguanine nucleotide levels >250 pmol per 8 x 10 red blood cells correlated with a higher response (odds ratio, 4.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-11.46, P = 0.007), whereas 6-methyl-mercaptopurine and 6-methyl-mercaptopurine:6-thioguanine nucleotide ratio showed no correlation. Other novel response predictors in children with IBD were relative leukopenia (odds ratio, 14.01; 95% confidence interval, 3.77-52.10; P < 0.001) and the absence of lymphopenia (odds ratio, 3.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-10.89; P = 0.017). Lower thiopurine methyltransferase activity (P = 0.015), lower platelet count (P = 0.020), and higher aspartate aminotransferase level (P = 0.009) also predicted therapeutic response. Age, gender, patient adherence, the duration of AZA therapy, IBD type, erythrocyte count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate did not predict efficacy. The high interindividual variability accounting for 57.7% of variance in therapeutic response was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The significant 6-thioguanine nucleotide level-response relationship may support metabolite monitoring to improve thiopurine efficacy in pediatric IBD. The reported response predictors may be helpful for treatment optimization in AZA-treated children with IBD, but should be proved in prospective studies.},

   abstract = {Agaricus blazei Murill (AbM) is traditionally used against a wide range of conditions such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, foot-and-mouth disease and chronic hepatitis C infection. In this study, we evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of AbM. For the non-specific immune response experiments, a total of 40 female BALB/c mice were divided into control (group 1) and experimental (groups 2-4) groups of 10 animals each. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were orally-administered high (819 mg/kg), medium (273 mg/kg) and low (136.5 mg/kg) doses of AbM daily for six weeks and then six parameters related to non-specific immune response were detected. For the adaptive immune response experiments, 40 female mice were similarly divided into four groups. After six weeks of treatment, animals were immunized with the OVA immunogen. Two weeks later, splenocytes and sera were collected. Four parameters related to adaptive immune response were evaluated. We found that feeding mice with AbM extract increased the IgG level in serum, promoted phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages and elevated the activity of Natural killer cells. We also found that the highest dose of AbM increased interleukin-2 (IL-2) levels in splenocytes and that a medium dose increased interferon-gamma. The levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4) were reduced or unchanged. T-helper type 1 cytokine levels were increased. AbM increased the humoral immune response and also affected the cellular immune response. These results provide evidence that AbM can modulate innate and adaptive immunity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of venous thrombotic events (TEs). We sought to evaluate the risk for TE in children and adolescents with IBD using a large population database. METHODS: The triennial Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database was used in a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized children in the United States across 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009. Billing codes were used to identify discharges with Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, thrombosis of intracranial venous sinus, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and portal vein thrombosis. A logistic regression model was fitted to quantify the increased risk of TE in children with IBD, while adjusting for other risk factors of thrombosis. RESULTS: The total weighted number of pediatric discharges was 7,448,292, and 68,394 (0.92%) were identified with IBD. The incidence of any TE in a hospitalized child or adolescent with IBD was 117.9/10,000 with a relative risk (95% confidence interval) of 2.36 (2.15-2.58). The adjusted odds ratio for any TE in a patient with IBD without surgery was 1.22 (1.08-1.36). Risk factors for TE among patients with IBD include older age, central venous catheter, parenteral nutrition, and an identified hypercoagulable condition. There is an increasing trend of TE in both the IBD and non-IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized children and adolescents with IBD are at increased risk for TE. Conservative methods of TE prevention including hydration, mobilization, or pneumatic devices should be considered in hospitalized patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical course of ulcerative colitis (UC) is unpredictable. The need for reliable biomarkers to reflect disease severity and predict disease course is therefore large. We investigated whether cytokines in mucosal tissue and serum reflect clinical disease severity at the onset of UC and predict the future disease course. METHODS: We prospectively monitored 102 patients from the onset of UC during 3 years, and they were followed up yearly for clinical and biochemical disease severity. Rectal biopsies were obtained from healthy controls and patients with UC. Serum and stool samples were obtained from patients with UC. Total mRNA from biopsies was analyzed with real-time PCR. Cytokine levels in serum were determined using Luminex or ELISA. RESULTS: Mucosal mRNA expression of IL-17A was 99.8 times higher while IFN-gamma and IL-13 expression was increased 12.4 and 6.7 times, respectively, in patients relative to controls. Serum IL-17A correlated with clinical disease severity at the onset. Also, contrary to a number of other parameters, serum IL-17A at the onset predicted the clinical and biochemical course of the disease, as reflected by the Mayo score, number x severity of flares, and fecal calprotectin levels, respectively, during 3 years after the onset of the disease. None of these associations were found with mucosal cytokines at the onset. CONCLUSIONS: Serum IL-17A levels of treatment-naive patients with UC reflect clinical disease severity at the onset of the disease and also predicted the disease course over the following 3 years. Thus, serum IL-17A may be valuable in the clinical management of patients with UC at the onset of the disease.},

   abstract = {It has been presumed that aberrant immune response to intestinal microorganisms in genetically predisposed individuals may play a major role in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel disease, and there is a good deal of evidence supporting this hypothesis. Commensal enteric bacteria probably play a central role in pathogenesis, providing continuous antigenic stimulation that causes chronic intestinal injury. A strong biologic rationale supports the use of probiotics and prebiotics for inflammatory bowel disease therapy. Many probiotic strains exhibit anti-inflammatory properties through their effects on different immune cells, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion depression, and the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines. There is very strong evidence supporting the use of multispecies probiotic VSL#3 for the prevention or recurrence of postoperative pouchitis in patients. For treatment of active ulcerative colitis, as well as for maintenance therapy, the clinical evidence of efficacy is strongest for VSL#3 and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. Moreover, some prebiotics, such as germinated barley foodstuff, Psyllium or oligofructose-enriched inulin, might provide some benefit in patients with active ulcerative colitis or ulcerative colitis in remission. The results of clinical trials in the treatment of active Crohn's disease or the maintenance of its remission with probiotics and prebiotics are disappointing and do not support their use in this disease. The only exception is weak evidence of advantageous use of Saccharomyces boulardii concomitantly with medical therapy in maintenance treatment.},

   abstract = {There is increasing scientific interest in the field of vitamin D research, moving the focus beyond bone health to other disease processes. Low circulating vitamin D levels have been reported as a risk factor for several pathophysiologically divergent diseases, including cancers, diabetes, CVD, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But, therein, remains the challenge: can any single nutrient contribute to multiple complex disease mechanisms and, ultimately, have therapeutic potential? The aim of this review is to critically evaluate several strands of scientific evidence surrounding vitamin D and inflammation, primarily focusing on IBD. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased incidence of IBD and rheumatoid arthritis in countries of more northern latitudes, mirroring sunlight patterns. A considerable body of evidence supports the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, at least in animal models of IBD. Although it is accepted that suboptimal vitamin D status is common in IBD, some studies suggest that this associates with more severe disease. With regard to treatment, the data are only beginning to emerge from randomised controlled trials to suggest that people with IBD may remain in remission longer when treated with oral vitamin D. In conclusion, several strands of evidence suggest that vitamin D may modify the immune response in IBD. There is a continued need for large well-designed clinical trials and mechanistic studies to determine if, and how, this emerging promise translates into tangible clinical benefits for people with chronic debilitating diseases such as IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), similar to adults, are at increased risk of acquiring a Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Our objective was to characterize the health care burden associated with CDI in hospitalized pediatric patients with IBD. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed cases with a discharge diagnosis of IBD or CDI from the U.S. Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database. RESULTS: In our primary analysis, we evaluated pediatric cases with a principal diagnosis of IBD or CDI. For the year 2009, we identified 12,610 weighted cases with IBD of which 3.5% had CDI. In children with IBD, CDI was independently associated with lengthier hospital stays (8.0 versus 6.0 days; adjusted regression coefficient, 2.1 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-2.8), higher charges ($45,126 versus $34,703; adjusted regression coefficient, $11,506; 95% CI, 6192-16,820), and greater need for parenteral nutrition (15.9% versus 12.1%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0) and blood transfusion (17.7% versus 9.8%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.4). There were no deaths. We made similar observations in a subanalysis of cases with principal or secondary diagnoses of IBD or CDI. The incidence of CDI in patients with IBD increased between 2000 and 2009 from 21.7 to 28.0 cases per 1000 IBD cases per year (P < 0.001). There was a significant increase in CDI complicating ulcerative colitis (28.1 versus 42.2, P < 0.001) but not for Crohn's disease (18.3 versus 20.3). CONCLUSIONS: CDI represents a significant health care burden in hospitalized children with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence and prevalence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) seems to be increasing in North America and Europe. Our objective was to evaluate hospitalization rates in children with IBD in the United States during the decade 2000 to 2009. METHODS: We analyzed cases with a discharge diagnosis of Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) within the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. RESULTS: We identified 61,779 pediatric discharges with a diagnosis of IBD (CD, 39,451 cases; UC, 22,328 cases). The number of hospitalized children with IBD increased from 11,928 to 19,568 (incidence, 43.5-71.5 cases per 10,000 discharges per year; P < 0.001). For CD, the number increased from 7757 to 12,441 (incidence, 28.3-45.0; P < 0.001) and for UC, 4171 to 7127 (15.2-26.0; P < 0.001). Overall, there was a significant increasing trend for pediatric hospitalizations with IBD, CD, and UC (P < 0.001). In addition, there was an increase in IBD-related complications and comorbid disease burden (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: There was a significant increase in the number and incidence of hospitalized children with IBD in the United States from 2000 to 2009.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Utilization trends and health effects of infliximab and adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are incompletely understood. We aimed to describe utilization trends of these 2 anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, determine the correlation between utilization with rates of hospitalization and surgery and describe differences in use between adults and children. METHODS: Longitudinal data were analyzed for drug utilization, hospitalization, and abdominal surgery. Descriptive statistics were used to show trends, and utilization quotients were compared for standardization. Multivariate logistic regression analysis assessed the association between drug use and rates of hospitalization and surgery. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-eight pediatric and 2514 adult patients with IBD generated a total of 51,882 inpatient and outpatient encounters, representing 1185 Crohn's disease, 1531 ulcerative colitis, and 236 indeterminate colitis patients. From 2007 through 2012, utilization quotients declined for hospitalization but remained unchanged for surgery; adalimumab saw a 3-fold increase, despite continued dominance of infliximab. Median band and mean fitted plots showed downward hospitalization trends from 2006 to 2012. Utilization of infliximab peaked in 2008, Q4 with gradual decline to 2012, Q2; and adalimumab showed moderate increased utilization since 2007, Q1. Use of infliximab (odds ratio [OR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.83) and adalimumab (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.72-0.87) was associated with decreased hospitalization risk but not associated with reduced abdominal surgery risk. Children had increased hospitalization (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 2.49-2.88) but decreased risk for abdominal surgery (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46-0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Current infliximab use remains substantially greater than adalimumab use, despite recent increased use of adalimumab. Although trends for hospitalization for IBD are decreasing, it is not reflected in abdominal surgery rates in a tertiary IBD referral center.},

   abstract = {The chronic intestinal inflammation that characterises Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis arises from a complex interplay between host genotype, the immune system, and the intestinal microbiota. In addition, environmental factors such as smoking impact on disease onset and progression. Individuals who smoke are more likely to develop Crohn's disease, and smoking is associated with recurrence after surgery and a poor response to medical therapy. Conversely, smoking appears protective against ulcerative colitis and smokers are less likely to require colectomy. The mechanism by which smoking exerts its impact on disease and the rational for the dichotomous effect in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is not clear. Recent evidence suggests that smoking induces alterations to both the innate and acquired immune system. In addition, smoking is associated with a distinct alteration in the intestinal microbiota both in patients with active Crohn's disease and healthy subjects.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We developed a new IgA and IgG anti-MZGP2 antibody ELISAs based on recombinant isoform-4 of human zymogen granule protein-2 (GP2), which is the major autoantigen of Crohn's disease (CrD)-specific pancreatic autoantibodies and assessed their clinical relevance in the largest inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort tested to date. METHODS: 832 sera were studied, including 617 consecutive IBD patients from 323 CrD and 294 ulcerative colitis (UC) follow-up in a tertiary centre, and 112 pathological and 103 normal controls. RESULTS: Sensitivity of IgA anti-MZGP2 for CrD in the IBD population was 15% and specificity was 98% (95, 99), while the sensitivity and specificity of IgG anti-MZGP2 were 27% and 97%. IgA and IgG anti-MZGP2 combined testing led to a sensitivity of 31% and a specificity of 96%. Positivity for either ASCA (IgA or IgG) or anti-MZGP2 (IgA or IgG) showed a sensitivity of 75% (70, 80) and a specificity of 84% (79, 89). IgA anti-MZGP2 antibodies were more prevalent in CrD patients with early disease onset (p=0.011). Also, anti-MZGP2 positive patients more frequently had extensive disease with ileal involvement. Patients with longer disease duration were more likely to have IgG anti-MZGP2 antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel ELISA confirms the high specificity of anti-MZGP2 antibodies for CrD and their association with disease severity phenotypes.},

   abstract = {Frequency of inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) tends to increase in developing countries. Nearly 25% of cases affects pediatric patients. Inflammatory bowel diseases are often associated with weight loss and stunting in children. Moreover, weight and height deficiencies are often early symptoms. Initially, nonspecific or latent course of disease delays the diagnostic process. Malnutrition in inflammatory bowel diseases can be caused by disorders of digestion and nutrients' absorption, intestinal loss, increased energy expenditure and appetite impairment. Nutritional deficiencies and inflammatory agents lead to disturbance of tissue metabolism - muscle and bone - and retardation of somatic development of affected children. Thus, deficiencies of muscle mass, bone mineral density and body height are observed. Insufficient normalization of somatic features may be the consequence of recurrent nature of disease and specificity of pharmacological treatment. Present work deals with the current state of knowledge concerning the somatic development disorders of children with inflammatory bowel diseases. Abnormal nutritional status, bone mineral density deficits and growth failure of patients have been discussed in the context of their relations and dependencies on inflammatory, nutritional and therapeutic factors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) arachidonic acid (AA, n-6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, n-3) are precursors of eicosanoids and other lipid mediators which have critical roles in inflammation. The mediators formed from the different PUFA have different potencies. We hypothesised that metabolic changes associated with colonic mucosal inflammation would modify the bioavailability of the eicosanoid precursors AA and EPA. METHODS: Colonic mucosa biopsies were obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis and from matched controls. Inflammation was graded endoscopically and histologically. Esterified and non-esterified fatty acids were determined within the biopsies using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. RESULTS: Biopsy samples were collected from 69 UC patients (54 providing both inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa) and 69 controls. Inflamed mucosa had higher AA (p<0.001) and lower EPA (p<0.010) contents and a higher AA:EPA ratio (p<0.001). Inflamed mucosa also had higher docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and lower linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-LNA) contents (all p<0.001), compared to non-inflamed and controls. There were significant correlations between severity of inflammation and contents of AA, DPA and DHA (positive correlations) and of LA, alpha-LNA and EPA (negative correlations). CONCLUSIONS: Higher AA, AA:EPA ratio, DPA and DHA and lower LA, alpha-LNA and EPA are seen in inflamed mucosa in UC and correlate with severity of inflammation. This suggests an alteration in fatty acid metabolism in the inflamed gut mucosa, which may offer novel targets for intervention and should be considered if nutritional strategies are used.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with ulcerative colitis (UC) are at increased risk for colorectal cancer. The standard method of surveillance for neoplasia in UC by colonoscopy is invasive and can miss flat lesions. We sought to identify a gene expression signature in nondysplastic mucosa without active inflammation that could serve as a marker for remote neoplastic lesions. METHODS: Gene expression was analyzed by complementary DNA microarray in 5 normal controls, 4 UC patients without dysplasia, and 11 UC patients harboring remote neoplasia. Common gene ontology pathways of significantly differentially expressed genes were identified. Expression of genes which were progressively and significantly upregulated from controls to UC without neoplasia, to UC with remote neoplasia were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Several gene products were also examined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-eight genes were significantly upregulated, and 541 genes were significantly downregulated in UC patients with neoplasia compared with UC patients without neoplasia. Nine genes (ACSL1, BIRC3, CLC, CREM, ELTD1, FGG, S100A9, THBD, and TPD52L1) were progressively and significantly upregulated from controls to nondysplastic UC to UC with neoplasia. Immunostaining of proteins revealed increased expression of S100A9 and REG1alpha in UC-associated cancer and in nondysplastic tissue from UC patients harboring remote neoplasia compared with UC patients without neoplasia and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression changes occurring as a field effect in the distal colon of patients with chronic UC identify patients harboring remote neoplastic lesions. These markers may lead to a more accurate and less invasive method of detection of neoplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {The cytokine IL-1 is critical to the pathogenesis of a variety of human conditions and diseases. Unlike most other cytokines, IL-1 is counterbalanced by two endogenous inhibitors. The functional significance of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) is well documented due to the clinical utilization of the recombinant human IL-1RA analog, anakinra. In contrast, much less is known about the type 2 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R2), which acts as a decoy receptor for IL-1. While IL-1R2 is structurally similar to the type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) responsible for IL-1 signal transduction, its truncated cytoplasmic domain and lack of Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) region renders IL-1R2 incapable of transmembrane signaling. IL-1R2 competes with IL-1R1 for ligands and for the IL-1R1 co-receptor, IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAP). Additionally, IL-1R2 exists in both a membrane bound and soluble form (sIL-1R2) that has biological properties similar to both a decoy receptor and a binding protein. Thus far, IL-1R2 has been implicated in arthritis, endometriosis, organ transplantation, sepsis/sickness behavior, diabetes, atherosclerosis, autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED), Alzheimer's disease and ulcerative colitis. In this review, we will detail the functional properties of IL-1R2 and examine its role in human disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory process of gastrointestinal tract, which frequently affects children. Recent advances in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique have made small bowel imaging possible, what is extremely useful in pediatrics. The purpose of this article is to describe the characteristic MR enterography findings and to present the advantages of this modality in pediatric patients. MATERIAL/METHODS: A group of 40 patients referred from the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Medical University of Warsaw was included in the analysis. The patients' age ranged from 7 to 18 years (mean age 14 years). Among the study participants, 28 patients were diagnosed with CD, whereas 12 patients had a history of ulcerative colitis or were strongly suspected of CD based on clinical data. The examinations were performed on GE Signa HD 1,5 T system. Small bowel distention was achieved by oral administration of 600-1000 ml of hyperosmotic solution of polyetylenglycol (PEG). Prior to the examination, 20-40 mg of a spasmolytic drug, hioscine-N-butylobromide (Buscolysin((R))), was administrated to reduce peristaltic movements. RESULTS: The abnormal small bowel segments were found in 21 patients and the features of colonic disease were detected in 5 patients. In 2 patients the lesions involved both small and large bowel. In 16 subjects mural changes were not found. Among studied patients, following signs of small bowel inflammation were fund: bowel wall thickening (n=21), submucosal edema (n=8), segment wall hyperenhancement (n=18), deep ulceration (n=6), fistula (n=3), stenosis (n=7), mesenteric signs such as hyperemia (n=9), fibrofatty proliferation (n=8) and lymphadenopathy (n=28). CONCLUSIONS: MR enterography is an excellent examination, which provides an accurate information about severity and activity of and complications related to CD. It is especially valuable in children, because of lack of the negative consequences of repeated exposure to ionizing radiation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional implications of IBD.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammation increases colorectal cancer (CRC) risk as seen in ulcerative colitis (UC). Proinflammatory cytokines play a critical role in mediating the development of colitis associated cancer (CAC). In this study, the therapeutic efficacy of anti-interleukin (IL)-17A by anti-IL-17A antibody injection on the development of CAC was assessed in 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) plus dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced CAC mouse model. The results showed that mice dosed with DMH plus DSS for 10 weeks evoked high degree dysplastic lesion in the large bowel that accompanied with significant increased IL-17A expression, proliferation index and inflammation degree in mice. After anti-IL-17A antibody injection for 2 weeks, the number of tumors, proliferation index and the expression level of IL-17A protein in the large bowel tissues were significantly decreased. Therefore, we concluded that the anti-IL-17A blockade can suppress the development of CAC and is a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention of CAC in colitis mice.},

   abstract = {In recent years, pediatric health care has embraced the concept of quality improvement to improve patient outcomes. As quality improvement efforts are implemented, network collaboration (where multiple centers and practices implement standardized programs) is a popular option. In a collaborative network, improvement in the conduct of structural, process and outcome quality measures can lead to improvements in overall health, and benchmarks can be used to assess and compare progress. In this review article, we provided an overview of the quality improvement movement and the role of quality indicators in this movement. We reviewed current quality improvement efforts in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as well as other pediatric chronic illnesses. We discussed the need to standardize the development of quality indicators used in quality improvement networks to assess medical care, and the validation techniques which can be used to ensure that process indicators result in improved outcomes of clinical significance. We aimed to assess current quality improvement efforts in pediatric IBD and other diseases, such as childhood asthma, childhood arthritis, and neonatal health. By doing so, we hope to learn from their successes and failures and to move the field forward for future improvements in the care provided to children with IBD.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: One of the elements of treatment considering inflammatory bowel diseases is nutritional therapy. The duration of the above-mentioned depends on the prevalence of such symptoms as fever, bowel movements, length of the functioning gastrointestinal tract, stoma and intestinal fistula presence. Nutritional therapy is an essential element of successful treatment alongside pharmacological, surgical, and biological therapy, as well as other methods. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis considered as chronic diseases, lead towards physical and biopsychosocial disability, being responsible for the reduction in the quality of life. The aim of the study was to determine the quality of life after surgical procedures in case of patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, subjected to natural and parenteral nutrition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised 52 patients from the Department of Gastroenterology, Military Medical Institute, and Department of Surgery and Clinical Nutrition, Clinical Hospital in Warsaw. The study was performed between October, 2011 and April, 2012. The World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument - Bref (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to deter-mine the patients' quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: A lower quality of life was observed in case of patients subjected to parenteral nutrition, poor education, disease symptoms exacerbation, in the majority-rural inhabitants. The quality of life does not depend on gender, type of disease, family status, and additional medical care.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The distribution of IgG4 plasma cells in colonic mucosa, its significance, and relation to disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unclear. We systematically evaluated IgG4 cell distribution in colonic mucosal biopsies of patients with IBD and correlated histological findings with disease pattern and mucosal inflammation. METHODS: We reviewed clinical records and pathology specimens of 54 randomly selected patients with IBD (13 Crohn's colitis: 7 active, 6 inactive; 18 ulcerative colitis [UC]: 10 active, 8 inactive; 23 UC with primary sclerosing cholangitis: 11 active colitis, 12 inactive colitis), and 11 controls (3 nonspecific diarrhea, 8 collagenous/lymphocytic colitis) who had colonoscopy and biopsies performed at our institution from April 2003 to July 2010. Immunostains for IgG4 were performed on archived rectal biopsies. Presence of >10 IgG4 cells per high-power field (x40 field) on microscopic evaluation was considered significant. RESULTS: Overall, significant IgG4 plasma cell infiltration was seen in 24% of patients compared with none of the controls (P = 0.05). Within IBD groups, significant infiltration was limited to patients with UC with active colitis (30%), primary sclerosing cholangitis with inactive (25%) and active (64%) colitis. In contrast, patients with Crohn's colitis, UC with inactive colitis, and controls had rare IgG4 plasma cells. No correlation was observed between the number of IgG4 cells and degree of active inflammation. In 4 patients with UC and primary sclerosing cholangitis who had more than 1 colonoscopy and biopsies, the number of IgG4 cells fluctuated without correlation with colonic disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: IgG4 plasma cells are significantly increased in a subset of patients with IBD suggesting the possibility of a B-cell-mediated mechanism in these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Telephone communication is common between healthcare providers and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We analyzed telephone activity at an IBD care center to identify disease and patient characteristics associated with high levels of telephone activity and determine if call volume could identify individuals at risk for future visits to the emergency department (ED) or hospitalization. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study in which we categorized telephone calls received by nursing staff over 2 years at a tertiary care IBD clinic (2475 patients in 2009 and 3118 in 2010). We analyzed data on 21,979 ingoing and outgoing calls in 2009 and 32,667 calls in 2010 and assessed associations between clinical factors and logged telephone encounters, and between patterns of telephone encounters and future visits to the ED or hospitalization. RESULTS: Telephone encounters occurred twice as frequently as office visits; 15% of the patients generated >10 telephone encounters per year and were responsible for half of all telephone encounters. A higher percentage of these high telephone encounter (HTE) patients were female, had Crohn's disease, received steroid treatment, had increased levels of C-reactive protein and rates of erythrocyte sedimentation, had psychiatric comorbidities, and had chronic abdominal pain than patients with lower telephone encounters. The HTE patients were also more frequently seen in the ED or hospitalized over the same time period and in subsequent years. Forty-two percent of patients with >8 telephone encounters within 30 days were seen in the ED or hospitalized within the subsequent 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Based on an analysis of telephone records at an IBD clinic, 15% of patients account for half of all calls. These HTE patients are a heterogeneous group with refractory disease who are likely to visit the ED or be hospitalized.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous investigations have produced mixed findings on whether youth with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experience elevated rates of depressive symptoms. Our first aim was to compare self-report of depressive symptoms by youth with IBD with a community sample. The second aim was to examine the relationship between symptoms of depression and measures of disease activity. METHODS: Item-level responses on the Children's Depression Inventory among a sample of 78 youth diagnosed with IBD were compared with responses from a community sample using 1-sample t-tests. Particular attention was given to items assessing somatic symptoms of depression given the potential overlap with IBD disease symptoms. The relationship between depressive symptoms and IBD disease activity was evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and linear regression. RESULTS: Youth with IBD reported lower levels of depressive symptoms compared with the community sample on the Children's Depression Inventory Total Score, and similar or lower levels of difficulty on items assessing somatic symptoms. Most of the sample had inactive or mild disease activity at the time of participation, with 14% experiencing moderate/severe disease activity. Higher ratings of disease activity were related to greater depressive symptoms. Responses on somatic items from the Children's Depression Inventory were not differentially related to disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: As a group, pediatric patients with IBD did not experience the clinical levels of depressive symptoms or elevations in depressive symptoms when compared with a community sample. Somatic symptoms of depression do not differentiate youth with IBD experiencing elevations in disease activity from youth experiencing nonsomatic symptoms of depression.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Managing patients with inflammatory bowel disease requires multidisciplinary coordination. Technological advances have enhanced access to care for patients and improved physician interactions. The primary aim of our project was to convene diverse institutions and specialties through a multisite virtual conferencing platform to discuss complex patient management. METHODS: The case conference is designed to include multiple institutions to exchange ideas, review evidence-based data, and provide input on the management of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Technology is supplied and coordinated by an information technology specialist and Chorus Call, Inc., an international teleconferencing service provider. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Live Interinstitutional Interdisciplinary Videoconference Education (IBD LIVE) initiative is accredited by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Center for Continuing Education in the Health Sciences for 1 AMA PRA Category 1 Credit per weekly session. RESULTS: IBD LIVE began in 2009 comprising only adult gastroenterology and pediatric gastroenterology from UPMC Presbyterian and Children's Hospitals. Participation steadily increased from 5 sites in 2010 to 11 sites in 2014. Maximum attendance for a single conference was 73 participants with a median of 48. The Continuing Medical Education scores (1 = worst to 5 = best) have a high median overall score (4.6, range 3.2-5.0) with positive responses with regard to the degree to which the conference changed practice. CONCLUSIONS: IBD LIVE has been successful and continues to grow. Implementation of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Virtual Preceptor Program using the IBD LIVE platform will provide expanded national physician access to this professional education activity.},

   abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate serum amino acids profile in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and impacts of graded dose of arginine or glutamine supplementation on the colitis. Using DSS-induced colitis model, which is similar to human ulcerative colitis, we determined serum profile of amino acids at day 3, 7, 10 and 12 (5 days post DSS treatment). Meanwhile, effects of graded dose of arginine (0.4%, 0.8%, and 1.5%) or glutamine (0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0%) supplementation on clinical parameters, serum amino acids, colonic tight junction proteins, colonic anti-oxidative indicators [catalase, total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)], colonic pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)] in DSS-induced colitis were fully analyzed at day 7 and 12. Additionally, the activation of signal transduction pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3K)/PI3K-protein kinase B (Akt), and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)-myosin light chain (MLC20), were analyzed using immunoblotting. Serum amino acids analysis showed that DSS treatment changed the serum contents of amino acids, such as Trp, Glu, and Gln (P<0.05). Dietary arginine or glutamine supplementation had significant (P<0.05) influence on the clinical and biochemical parameters (T-SOD, IL-17 and TNF-alpha) in colitis model. These results were associated with colonic NF-kappaB, PI3K-Akt and MLCK signaling pathways. In conclusion, arginine or glutamine could be a potential therapy for intestinal inflammatory diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease (CD) and the epidemiological associations between diet and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) implicate diet in IBD causation. There is little evidence, however, to support specific dietary changes and patients often receive contradictory advice. AIM: To review the literature on the impacts of diet on IBD causation and activity to produce guidance based on 'best available evidence'. METHOD: Review of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases from 1975 to 2012 using MeSH headings 'crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'enteral' 'diet' 'nutrition' 'fatty acid' and 'food additives'. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with a formula-defined feed is effective treatment for CD, but approximately 50% of patients relapse within 6 months of return to normal diet. There is no direct evidence of benefit from any other specific dietary modification in CD, but indirect evidence supports recommendation of a low intake of animal fat, insoluble fibre and processed fatty foods containing emulsifiers. Foods tolerated in sustained remission may not be tolerated following relapse. Some evidence supports vitamin D supplementation. In ulcerative colitis (UC), evidence is weaker, but high intakes of meat and margarine correlate with increased UC incidence and high meat intake also correlates with increased likelihood of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence from interventional studies to support specific dietary recommendations. Nevertheless, people with IBD deserve advice based on 'best available evidence' rather than no advice at all, although dietary intake should not be inappropriately restrictive. Further interventional studies of dietary manipulation are urgently required.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) starting during childhood has been assumed to impair quality of life (QoL) of affected children. As this aspect is crucial for further personality development, the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed in a Swiss nationwide cohort to obtain detailed information on the fields of impairment. METHODS: Data were prospectively acquired from pediatric patients included in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study. IBD activity was evaluated by PCDAI and PUCAI. The age adapted KIDSCREEN questionnaire was evaluated for 110 children with IBD (64 with Crohn's disease 46 with ulcerative colitis). Data were analyzed with respect to established reference values of healthy controls. RESULTS: In the KIDSCREEN index a moderate impairment was only found for physical wellbeing due to disease activity. In contrast, mental well-being and social support were even better as compared to control values. A subgroup analysis revealed that this observation was restricted to the children in the German speaking part of Switzerland, whereas there was no difference compared to controls in the French part of Switzerland. Furthermore, autonomy and school variables were significantly higher in the IBD patients as compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The social support for children with IBD is excellent in this cohort. Only physical well-being was impaired due to disease activity, whereas all other KIDSCREEN parameters were better as compared to controls. This indicates that effective coping and support strategies may be able to compensate the burden of disease in pediatric IBD patients.},

   abstract = {Patients suffering from ulcerative colitis (UC) exhibit chronic colonic inflammation caused by a dysregulated mucosal immune response and epithelial barrier disruption. Th2 cytokines, including IL-13, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of UC. IL-13 induces phosphorylation of STAT6, and we previously demonstrated increased epithelial p-STAT6 in children with UC. In this study, we investigated the role of STAT6 in oxazolone colitis, a murine model of UC, by inducing colitis in STAT6-deficient (STAT6(-/-)) and wild type (WT) mice. We observed increased epithelial cell, T cell, macrophage, and NKT cell STAT6 phosphorylation, as well as increased p-STAT6(+) IL-13-producing NKT cells, in colitic WT mice. Colitis was attenuated in STAT6(-/-) mice, with improvements in weight, colon length, and histopathology. There was decreased induction of the pore-forming tight junction protein claudin-2 in STAT6(-/-) mice. Similarly, short hairpin RNA STAT6 knockdown reduced claudin-2 induction and transepithelial resistance decrease in IL-13-treated human T84 cells. Tissue expression of IL-13, IFN-gamma, IL-17, and IL-10 mRNA was similarly induced in WT and STAT6(-/-) colitic mice; however, we observed increased mRNA expression for the Th2-inducing cytokines IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin in WT mice with colitis, which was abrogated in STAT6(-/-) mice. Mesenteric lymph node cells from STAT6(-/-) mice with colitis exhibited reduced secretion of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IFN-gamma. IL-33 augmented mesenteric lymph node cell secretion of IL-5, IL-13, IL-6, and IFN-gamma. These data implicate STAT6 in the pathogenesis of colitis in vivo with important roles in altering epithelial barrier function and regulating Th2-inducing cytokine production.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although paediatric-onset IBD is becoming more common, few medications have a registered paediatric indication. There are multiple hurdles to performing clinical trials in children, emphasising the importance of choosing an appropriate outcome measure, which can facilitate enrolment, and thereby also drug approval. The aim of this consensus statement is to highlight paediatric specific issues and key factors critical for the optimal conduct of paediatric IBD trials. DESIGN: The Paediatric European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) committee has established an international expert panel to determine the best outcome measures in paediatric IBD, following a literature search and a modified Delphi process. All recommendations were endorsed by at least 80% agreement. RESULTS: Recognising the importance of mucosal healing (MH), the panel defined steroid-free MH as primary outcome measure for all drugs of new category with one or two postintervention endoscopies per trial (at 8-12 weeks and/or 54 weeks). Since endoscopic evaluation is a barrier for recruitment in children, trials with medications already shown to induce MH in children or adults, could use paediatric-specific disease activity scores as primary outcome, including a modified Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index in Crohn's disease and the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index in UC. Secondary outcomes should include safety issues, MR enterography-based damage and inflammatory scores (in Crohn's disease), faecal calprotectin, quality of life scales, and a patient-reported outcome. CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial to perform paediatric trials early in the development of new drugs in order to reduce off-label use of IBD medication in children. The thoughtful choice of feasible and standardised outcome measures can help move us towards this goal.},

Treatment strategies must reflect that pediatric-onset UC has a slightly different phenotype than adult-onset disease with more often extensive (pancolitis) and more aggressive disease course. Other pediatric-specific aspects include growth, puberty, bone density accrual and emotional development and body image acquisition. These differences and others influenced the development of pediatric treatment algorithms. It is recommended that virtually all children with UC must be treated with some maintenance therapy and 5-ASA requirement and dosing are often higher in children. A larger number of children are at risk for steroid-dependency, and this should not be tolerated; steroid sparing strategies with early use of immunosuppressors are recommended in high-risk patients. On the other hand, the safety profile of immunosuppressive therapy in children includes the rare forms of lymphomas and many future treatment years. Colectomy and pouch formation should be balanced in the treatment algorithms against the higher rate of future infertility in girls. The acute and on-going management of pediatric UC should be guided by evidence- and consensus-based balanced decisions, reflecting a vision of long-term treatment goals.},

Implementation of psychosocial screening into clinical practice remains a challenge. This study examines the clinical utility of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) screening in predicting disease outcome and healthcare utilization. METHODS: One hundred twelve youth of 7 to 18 years diagnosed with IBD and their parents. Youth completed standardized measures of HRQOL and depression. Parents completed a proxy report of HRQOL. Pediatric gastroenterologists provided the Physician Global Assessment. Families were recruited from a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Retrospective chart reviews examined disease outcome and healthcare utilization for 12 months after baseline measurement. RESULTS: Linear regressions, controlling for demographic and disease parameters, revealed that baseline measurement of youth and parent proxy-reported HRQOL predicted the number of IBD-related hospital admissions, gastroenterology clinic visits, emergency department visits, psychology clinic visits, telephone contacts, and pain management referrals over the next 12 months. Disease outcome was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Lower HRQOL was predictive of increased healthcare utilization among youth with IBD. Regular HRQOL screening may be the impetus to providing better case management and allocating resources based on ongoing care needs and costs. Proactive interventions focused on patients with poor HRQOL may be an efficient approach to saving on healthcare costs and resource utilization.},

Qing Dai has been traditionally used in Chinese herbal medicine for various inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis. We previously reported that Qing Dai suppressed inflammations by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ulcerative colitis patients. Thus, Qing Dai can attenuate the production of ROS, which play an important role in NSAID-induced gastrointestinal injuries. In this study, we aimed to elucidate whether Qing Dai decreased mitochondrial ROS production in NSAID-treated gastrointestinal cells by examining cellular injury, mitochondrial membrane potentials, and ROS production with specific fluorescent indicators. We also performed electron paramagnetic resonance measurement in isolated mitochondria with a spin-trapping reagent (CYPMPO or DMPO). Treatments with indomethacin and aspirin induced cellular injury and mitochondrial impairment in the gastrointestinal cells. Under these conditions, mitochondrial alterations were observed on electron microscopy. Qing Dai prevented these complications by suppressing ROS production in gastrointestinal cells. These results indicate that Qing Dai attenuated the ROS production from the NSAID-induced mitochondrial alteration in the gastrointestinal epithelial cells. Qing Dai treatment may be considered effective for the prevention NSAID-induced gastrointestinal injury.},

   abstract = {We evaluated the protective effect of dietary extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) polyphenol extract (PE) supplementation in the inflammatory response associated to chronic colitis model. Six-week-old mice were randomized in four dietary groups: standard diet (SD), EVOO diet and both enriched with PE (850 ppm) (SD+PE and EVOO+PE). After 30 days, animals that were exposed to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) (3%) followed by 3 weeks of drinking water developed chronic colitis, which was evaluated by disease activity index (DAI) and histology. Cell proliferation was analyzed by immunohistochemical and changes in monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Colonic expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), IkappaBalpha inhibitory and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) were determined by western blotting. SD-DSS group showed a significant increase of DAI, histological damage and cell proliferation, as well as an up-regulation of TNF-alpha, MCP-1, COX-2 and iNOS proteins. p38 and JNK MAPKs phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha degradation and PPARgamma deactivation were also observed. However, in DSS-treated and EVOO+PE-fed mice, DAI and cell proliferation were significantly reduced, as well as MCP-1, TNF-alpha, COX-2 and iNOS expression levels. In addition, this dietary group, notably down-regulated JNK phosphorylation, prevented IkappaBalpha degradation and PPARgamma deactivation. These results demonstrated, for the first time, that EVOO-PE supplementation possessed marked protective effects on experimental colitis through PPARgamma up-regulation and nuclear transcription factor-kappa B and MAPK signaling pathway inhibition, decreasing the inflammatory cascade. We concluded that PE-enriched EVOO diet could be a beneficial functional food on ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: Squalene is a polyunsaturated triterpene, which has exhibited anticancer and antioxidant activities among others. We investigated dietary squalene supplementation effect on an acute colitis model induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in C57BL/6 mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice were fed from weaning with squalene at 0.02% and 0.1%. After 4 weeks, mice were exposed to 3% DSS for 5 days developing acute colitis. After DSS removal (5 days), colons were histological and biochemically processed. Our results showed that dietary squalene treatment exerts anti-inflammatory action in DSS-induced acute colitis. Western blot revealed that squalene downregulated COX-2 (where COX is cyclooxygenase) and inducible nitric oxide synthase system by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways, preventing an increase in the cytokines levels. Under our experimental conditions, STAT3 and FOXP3 (where FOXP3 is forkhead box P3) were not modified and the transcriptional regulation of antioxidant and/or detoxifying enzymes, Nrf2 (where Nrf2 is nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2), was reduced in DSS-induced colitis. However, any change could be observed after squalene supplementation. CONCLUSION: Squalene was able to improve the oxidative events and returned proinflammatory proteins expression to basal levels probably through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways. However, supplementary studies are needed in order to provide a basis for developing a new dietary supplementation strategy.},

These disorders occur in areas of highest bacterial concentrations. Pouchitis and Crohn's colitis respond to antibiotics, while pouchitis and UC can be treated with probiotics. Serologic markers recognizing intestinal bacteria and yeast are present in the majority of Crohn's disease patients and may predict disease aggressiveness. Abnormal profiles of fecal and mucosally associated enteric bacteria (dysbiosis) occur in Crohn's disease, UC, pouchitis and experimental enterocolitis, with a proliferation of aggressive species that promote experimental colitis and a corresponding decrease in protective bacterial subsets. Many of these protective bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids, including butyrate, that promote epithelial barrier function, inhibit effector immune responses and induce regulatory T cell subsets. Furthermore, certain Clostridia species stimulate regulatory T cells that can inhibit intestinal inflammation. Animal models of chronic, immune-mediated enterocolitis convincingly demonstrate that enteric resident bacteria stimulate effector immune cells in susceptible hosts and that a subset of enteric bacteria has particularly aggressive activities, with host and bacterial specificity. Recent studies suggest parallel and perhaps complementary roles for enteric viruses, which have only very recently been identified.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Data to support treatment algorithms in ambulatory paediatric UC are scarce. We aimed to explore the 1 year outcome in an inception cohort of paediatric UC patients and to identify early predictors of good outcome that might serve as short term treatment targets. DESIGN: A chart review of 115 children with new onset UC was performed (age 11 +/- 4.1 years; 58 (50%) males; 86 (75%) extensive colitis; 70 (61%) moderate-severe disease; 63 (55%) received steroids at baseline). We assessed the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and laboratory variables at the time of diagnosis and at 3 months, and endoscopy at diagnosis. RESULTS: The 3 month PUCAI was the strongest predictor of 1 year sustained steroid free remission (SSFR) (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)=0.7 (95% CI 0.6 to 0.8) and colectomy by 2 years (AUROC=0.75 (0.6 to 0.89)). SSFR was achieved in 9/54 (17%) children who had active disease (PUCAI >/= 10) at 3 months (negative predictive value (NPV)=83%) and by 4/46 (8.6%) of those with a PUCAI score >10; (NPV=91%, positive predictive value=52%; p<0.001), implying that PUCAI >10 at 3 months has a probability of 9% for achieving SSFR versus 48% with a PUCAI value of </=10. None of the variables at baseline was predictive of SSFR or colectomy (endoscopic severity, disease extent, age, PUCAI or C reactive protein/erythrocyte sedimentation rate/albumin/haemoglobin; all AUROC<0.6, p>0.05) but baseline PUCAI predicted subsequent acute severe colitis and the need for salvage medical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Completeness of the early response appears more important than baseline UC severity for predicting outcome in children, and supports using PUCAI<10 as a feasible treatment goal. Our data suggest that treatment escalation should be considered with a PUCAI value of >/= 10 at 3 months.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We sought to define the point at which a recently noted marked increase in the incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) had occurred in children in Victoria, Australia. METHODS: A 60-year retrospective review (1950-2009) of children age 16 years or less diagnosed with UC in the state's major pediatric centers was performed. RESULTS: In all, 342 children were diagnosed with UC (male to female ratio of 1.25:1.0, median age 10.9 years, interquartile range [IQR] 7.0, 13.2). The overall median annual incidence of UC was 0.36/10(5) children </= 16 years of age (IQR 0.18, 0.66). The number of reported cases increased by 11-fold during the study period (P < 0.001). This marked increase appeared to occur from the early 1990s and has yet to plateau. Children diagnosed during the last two decades were older at diagnosis (median 10 years vs. 11.6, P < 0.0001), and had higher weight- and height-for-age z scores than those diagnosed during the first 40 years (mean weight-for-age [standard deviation] 1950-1989: -0.80 [1.56] vs. 1990-2009: -0.11 [1.17], P < 0.001; mean height-for-age 1950-1989: -0.50 [1.15] vs. 1990-2009: -0.13 [1.12], P < 0.05). More recently diagnosed children also had more extensive disease (1950-1989: 52% vs. 1990-2009: 71%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of UC has increased markedly in Victorian children since 1990. Although some of this change may be attributable to earlier diagnosis, it is unlikely that this can provide a complete explanation for this still-increasing condition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) commonly affect young patients in the reproductive phase of their lives. The chronic and relapsing nature of IBD and the potential need for medical or surgical interventions raise concerns about family planning issues. AIM: To review the current knowledge on IBD management in pregnant and nursing IBD patients. METHODS: A PubMed literature search was performed using the search terms 'reproduction' and 'inflammatory bowel disease' and using the headers and main subjects of each section of this article as search terms. RESULTS: Male and female fertility are not impaired in the majority of IBD patients. In IBD patients with quiescent disease pregnancy outcomes are not impaired in comparison to the general population, however, an increased incidence of pregnancy complications is observed in active IBD patients. As methotrexate (MTX) has been demonstrated to be teratogenic, the use of MTX is contraindicated in patients, who wish to conceive, throughout pregnancy and when nursing. However, normal pregnancies following MTX treatment at conception and later have been reported. Most of the other currently approved IBD medications are not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and may be used to maintain quiescent disease or to induce a rapid remission in patients with flares and active disease. Breast-feeding in IBD patients is possible and recommended. CONCLUSIONS: The overall outcome of pregnancies in IBD patients is favourable and not different to healthy controls, thus patients with IBD should not be discouraged from having children.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: We investigated the protective effect of the flavonoid myricitrin in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis as promising candidate for the treatment of ulcerative colitis which is considered an important worldwide public health problem. METHODS AND RESULTS: Male CD1 mice were provided with a solution of filtered water containing 3% w/v DSS ad libitum over a 5-day period followed by 2 days with normal drinking water. Myricitrin was administered orally, once a day, at the doses 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg of body weight. At the end of day 7th, the animals were euthanized and the colonic tissue was collected to be analyzed by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Our results showed that oral treatment with myricitrin exerts consistent anti-inflammatory action in DSS-induced acute colitis in mice by the inhibition of the Akt/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-dependent phosphorylation. Consequently, the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p38, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase and of the nuclear factor B (NF-kappaB) was reduced and prevented an increase in the cytokines/chemokines levels. CONCLUSION: Together, these data reveal that the anti-inflammatory effect of myricitrin in DSS-induced colitis in mice is likely associated with its ability to prevent the activation of upstream kinases, such as phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-dependent Akt, NF-kappaB, and mitogen-activated protein kinase.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: SLC22A23 is an orphan gene in the SLC22 family of organic membrane transporters, and its single-nucleotide polymorphism rs17309827-T was recently nominally associated with intestinal inflammation in a genome-wide association study. Other polymorphisms in the SLC22A23 gene have been associated with diseases with an inflammatory component, and polymorphisms in related genes in the SLC22 family have been repeatedly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). OBJECTIVE: In a candidate-gene study using a well-phenotyped, highly monitored, Manitoban white cohort, we investigated whether variations in SLC22A23 were associated with intestinal inflammation. DESIGN: Selected genetic variations were genotyped by using fluorescent-based assays or a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 160 individuals with Crohn disease, 149 individuals with ulcerative colitis, and 142 healthy control subjects to determine genetic associations. RESULTS: Homozygocity for single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs4959235-TT and rs950318-GG was associated with IBD, whereby 6% of patients (18 of 311 cases) carried these genotypes, but they were not seen in healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Associations reported in this article add to the emerging evidence that SLC22A23 variants could modify IBD risk. However, the biology of the gene and impact of variations on the gene's functions need to be tested to validate a causative role.},

   abstract = {Neonatal-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) accounts for only 0.25% of pediatric IBD cases. The molecular pathogenesis of IBD remains unclear. Recently, rare Mendelian mutations have been identified in children with very early-onset Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In this study, we report compound heterozygous mutations in the interleukin-10 receptor A (IL-10RA) gene in children with severe neonatal-onset IBD. Patient 1 had chronic diarrhea within the first month of life and had perianal fistulae. She was diagnosed with 'intractable ulcerating enterocolitis in infancy' and underwent subtotal colectomy at the age of 24 months because of poor response to immunosuppressant therapy. Compound heterozygous mutations, c.[301C>T];[350G>A](p.[R101W];[R117H]), were discovered in IL-10RA for this patient. Patient 2 presented symptoms within the first month of life and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Severe colitis and perianal and enteroenteric fistulae occurred repeatedly, and he underwent surgical management involving colectomy, colostomy, and ileostomy. We identified mutations in IL-10RA, c.[272A>G];[784C>T] (p.[Y91C];[R262C]). Patient 3 had chronic diarrhea and a rectovaginal fistula at 3 days of life and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. She underwent fistulectomy and ileostomy, but experienced frequent relapses. Mutations, c.[272A>G];[301C>T] (p.[Y91C];[R101W]), were found in IL-10RA. This report confirms the genetic defect of IL-10RA in neonatal-onset IBD including 'intractable ulcerating enterocolitis in infancy'.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are few reports from Iran about the epidemiology and clinical features of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aims to determine the epidemiologic profile and clinical features of IBD in Northwest Iran referral centers. METHODS: In a cross-sectional setting, we evaluated 200 patients with definitive diagnoses of IBD who referred to Tabriz educational hospitals during the period of 2005 to 2007. Demographic characteristics as well as patients' clinical profiles were evaluated. Disease activity and severity were determined by the Crohn's Disease Activity Index and Truelove and Witt's classification of ulcerative colitis (UC). The related probable demographic factors were tested. RESULTS: Of the 200 IBD patients, 183 (91.5%) were diagnosed with UC and 17 (8.5%) with Crohn's disease (CD). There was a positive first degree relative of IBD in 10.9% of UC and 11.8% of CD patients. Abdominal pain was the primary presenting symptom in 25.7% of UC patients and in 58.8% of those with CD. Among UC patients, left-sided colitis was the main feature (52.5%); while in patients with CD, colon involvement was predominant (52.9%). There was no significant contributor for activity or severity of disease noted among demographic factors. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of UC was much higher than CD. The onset of IBD occurred in younger ages with a predominance in males. Left-sided colitis in UC and colon involvement in CD was common. Mostly, the pattern of IBD was mild to moderate with good response to pharmacotherapy. Disease activity and severity were unaffected by demographic features.},

   abstract = {Intact interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R) signaling on effector and T regulatory (Treg) cells are each independently required to maintain immune tolerance. Here we show that IL-10 sensing by innate immune cells, independent of its effects on T cells, was critical for regulating mucosal homeostasis. Following wild-type (WT) CD4(+) T cell transfer, Rag2(-/-)Il10rb(-/-) mice developed severe colitis in association with profound defects in generation and function of Treg cells. Moreover, loss of IL-10R signaling impaired the generation and function of anti-inflammatory intestinal and bone-marrow-derived macrophages and their ability to secrete IL-10. Importantly, transfer of WT but not Il10rb(-/-) anti-inflammatory macrophages ameliorated colitis induction by WT CD4(+) T cells in Rag2(-/-)Il10rb(-/-) mice. Similar alterations in the generation and function of anti-inflammatory macrophages were observed in IL-10R-deficient patients with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. Collectively, our studies define innate immune IL-10R signaling as a key factor regulating mucosal immune homeostasis in mice and humans.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the etiology of two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are unknown and evidence suggests that chronic intestinal inflammation is caused by an excessive immune response to mucosal antigens. Previous studies support the role for TGF-beta1 through 3 in the initiation and maintenance of tolerance via the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to control intestinal inflammation. Leptin, a satiety hormone produced primarily by adipose tissue, has been shown to increase during colitis progression and is believed to contribute to disease genesis and/or progression. AIM: We investigated the ability of a pegylated leptin antagonist (PG-MLA) to ameliorate the development of chronic experimental colitis. RESULTS: Compared to vehicle control animals, PG-MLA treatment of mice resulted in an (1) attenuated clinical score; (2) reversed colitis-associated pathogenesis including a decrease in body weight; (3) reduced systemic and mucosal inflammatory cytokine expression; (4) increased insulin levels and (5) enhanced systemic and mucosal Tregs and CD39(+) Tregs in mice with chronic colitis. The percentage of systemic and mucosal TGF-beta1, -beta2 and -beta3 expressing CD4(+) T cells were augmented after PG-MLA treatment. The activation of STAT1 and STAT3 and the expression of Smad7 were also reduced after PG-MLA treatment in the colitic mice. These findings clearly suggest that PG-MLA treatment reduces intestinal Smad7 expression, restores TGF-beta1-3 signaling and reduces STAT1/STAT3 activation that may increase the number of Tregs to ameliorate chronic colitis. CONCLUSION: This study clearly links inflammation with the metabolic hormone leptin suggesting that nutritional status influences immune tolerance through the induction of functional Tregs. Inhibiting leptin activity through PG-MLA might provide a new and novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Curcumin, an active ingredient of turmeric with anti-inflammatory properties, has been demonstrated to be useful in experimental models of ulcerative colitis (UC). It's efficacy in humans needs to be investigated. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, single-centre pilot trial was conducted in patients with distal UC (<25 cm involvement) and mild-to-moderate disease activity. Forty-five patients were randomized to either NCB-02 (standardized curcumin preparation) enema plus oral 5-ASA or placebo enema plus oral 5-ASA. Primary end point was disease response, defined as reduction in Ulcerative Colitis Diseases Activity Index by 3 points at 8 weeks, and secondary end points were improvement in endoscopic activity and disease remission at 8 weeks. RESULTS: Response to treatment was observed in 56.5% in NCB-02 group compared to 36.4% (p=0.175) in placebo group. At week 8, clinical remission was observed in 43.4% of patients in NCB-02 group compared to 22.7% in placebo group (p=0.14) and improvement on endoscopy in 52.2% of patients in NCB-02 group compared to 36.4% of patients in placebo group (p=0.29). Per protocol analysis revealed significantly better outcomes in NCB-02 group, in terms of clinical response (92.9% vs. 50%, p=0.01), clinical remission (71.4% vs. 31.3%, p=0.03), and improvement on endoscopy (85.7% vs. 50%, p=0.04). CONCLUSION: In this pilot study we found some evidence that use of NCB-02 enema may tend to result in greater improvements in disease activity compared to placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate distal UC. The role of NCB-02 as a novel therapy for UC should be investigated further.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Antibodies reacting with various microbial epitopes have been described in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and are associated with a specific diagnosis and clinical presentation. AIM: To evaluate the profile of new anti-glycan antibodies, their potential association with disease phenotype and diagnostic accuracy in paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood samples from 134 paediatric IBD patients (109 CD, 25 ulcerative colitis (UC)) and 67 controls were blindly analysed for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA), anti-chitobioside carbohydrate (ACCA), anti-laminaribioside carbohydrate (ALCA), and anti-mannobioside carbohydrate (AMCA) antibodies using commercially available assays. The serological response to glycans was correlated with clinical disease characteristics. RESULTS: At least one of the tested anti-glycan antibodies was present in 75% of CD patients. Despite the high frequency of reactivity to glycan epitopes, a limited overlap of serological markers was observed. In total, 49% of ASCA-negative patients presented with one of the following: ACCA, ALCA, or AMCA. The occurrence of one antibody from the anti-glycan panel was independently associated with complicated disease phenotype and ileocolonic disease location. A higher level of immune response as assessed by the quartile sum scores for ACCA, ALCA, and AMCA was linked with older age at diagnosis (10-17 years) and ileocolonic disease location. The ASCA had the greatest accuracy for diagnosis and differentiation of CD. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative and quantitative serologicalal response to glycan epitopes was associated with distinct clinical presentation in paediatric CD patients. This raises the possibility for the use of these markers to differentiate subgroups of CD patients with more sever clinical presentation. The ASCA was the most accurate serological marker for CD; however, testing for the new anti-glycan antibodies may constitute an adjunctive tool in a specific group of patients to aid in the differentiation of CD with absent ASCA from ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) has changed dramatically in recent years with a wider use of immunomodulators and the introduction of antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents. This article reviews the existing data on the long-term efficacy of biologics, that is, anti-TNF agents, for preventing complications and surgery in patients with IBD. RECENT FINDINGS: Anti-TNF agents are effective for preventing endoscopic and surgical recurrence after surgery for Crohn's disease. They are able to achieve fistula closure and do not increase the risk of stricture. Most randomized short-term trials also showed decreased requirement for hospitalizations and surgery in patients receiving anti-TNF. However, observational studies from referral centers or based on population have shown conflicting results. The need for surgery in Crohn's disease and the risk of colectomy in ulcerative colitis seem to be decreasing in recent years, but the specific effect of the introduction of anti-TNF agents cannot be currently evaluated. SUMMARY: Although anti-TNF agents are the most powerful drugs in IBD, their ability to decrease the need for surgery remains unclear. Conflicting results observed in observational surveys might be because of anti-TNF agents administered too late in the course of IBD.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 38 (28 Male; 10 Female) hospitalized patients with moderate or severe IBD (13 with Crohn's disease (CD); 25 with Ulcerative colitis (UC)) were included. At stage 1, the disease severity, clinical symptoms and, signs, food consumption and nutritional status by using subjective global assessment (SGA) were recorded. At stage 2, the patients were blindly randomized into a Study Group and Controls. In the Study Group, a standard enteral product was added into the regulated hospital diets, but for the Controls, deficits were regulated by only hospital diets for 3 weeks. the independent variables were the group, the disease and its activity, age, Body body mass index (BMI), weight loss history, the hospitalization period; the dependent variables were SGA, bowel movements, change in nutritional status, disease severity, clinical findings, and also consumption of macronutrients. RESULTS: Prevalance of malnutrition (SGA-B or SGA-C) for all the patients was 92.1% at the beginning and 71.1% at the end of study. Improvements in disease activity score for the patients with UC were statistically significant in both the Study Group and the Controls (p=0.006 for the Study Group and p=0.001 for the Controls, respectively). Macronutrients, total and water soluble fiber consumption levels improved, with statistically significant differences for all the groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is a major problem in patients with IBD. Not only the regulation of hospital food, but also enteral nutritional support, improved their levels of malnutrition, as well as their energy, macronutrients, and fiber consumption, and SGA is an easy method for nutritional monitoring.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The lumen of the gastrointestinal tract contains many substances produced from the breakdown of foodstuffs, from salivary, esophageal, intestinal, hepatic, and pancreatic secretions, and from sloughed cells present in the gastrointestinal lumen. Although these substances were traditionally regarded as waste products, there is increasing realization that many can be biologically active, either as signalling compounds or as nutrients. For example, proteins are broken down into amino acids, which are then sensed by nutrient receptors. The gut microbiome, which is at highest abundance in the ileocecum, has powerful metabolic activity, digesting and breaking down unabsorbed carbohydrates, proteins, and other ingested nutrients into phenols, amines, volatile organic compounds, methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and hydrogen sulfide into volatile fatty acids, also called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). CONCLUSION: These latter substances are the topic of this review. In this review, we will briefly discuss recent advances in the understanding SCFA production, signalling, and absorption, followed by a detailed description and discussion of trials of SCFAs, probiotics, and prebiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal disease, in particular ulcerative colitis (UC), pouchitis, short bowel syndrome, and obesity.},

The fermented sauces, particularly FSeS, significantly suppressed DSS-induced body weight loss, increased colon length, and decreased colon weight/length ratios. Histological observations suggested that the fermented sauces prevented edema, mucosal damage, and the loss of crypts induced by DSS compared to the control mice and animals fed AHSS. FSeS and FSS decreased the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-17alpha. mRNA expression of these cytokines as well as that of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in colon mucosa was also inhibited by the two sauces. Our results suggest that fermented sauces, especially FSeS, exert an anticolitic effect partially by reducing the serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines and inhibiting the mRNA expression of these factors in the colon tissue of mice treated with DSS. However, AHSS did not protect against DSS-induced colitis. In addition, low-dose treatment (4 mL/kg) with the fermented sauces resulted in greater anticolitic effects than consumption of a high quantity (8 mL/kg) of the sauces.},

Body weight, disease activity index (DAI), colon length, colon weight to length ratio, colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured. Histological changes were observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Colonic levels of tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNFalpha), interleukin(IL)1beta and IL6 were measured with an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA expression of TNFalpha, IL1beta, 6, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase2 (COX-2) in the colon tissue, was quantified by RTPCR. KME significantly suppressed DSSinduced body weight loss, colon length shortening and decreased the colon weight to length ratio. It also resulted in increased GSH and reduced MPO and MDA levels in the colon tissue. Histological observation suggested that KME prevented edema, mucosal damage and loss of crypts, which are induced by DSS. In addition, KME decreased the levels of TNFalpha, IL1beta and 6 in the colon tissues, while inhibiting the mRNA expression of these cytokines, as well as iNOS and COX2. The results of this study suggested that KME has antiinflammatory effects on DSSinduced UC in mice (C57BL/6J strain) by reducing the colonic levels and inhibiting the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is supported by migration studies and increasing incidences in line with Westernisation. AIM: To give a complete overview of studies associating habitual diet with the onset or relapses in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: A structured search in Pubmed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE was performed using defined key words, including only full text papers in English language. RESULTS: Forty-one studies were identified, investigating onset (n = 35), relapses (n = 5) or both (n = 1). Several studies reported high intake of sugar or sugar-containing foods (n = 7 UC, n = 12 CD), and low intake of fruits and/or vegetables (n = 5 UC, n = 10 CD) to be associated with an increased onset risk. However, these findings could not be confirmed by similar or higher numbers of other studies. A possible protective role was found for grain-derived products in CD onset, but results were inconsistent for dietary fibre in UC and CD and grain-derived products in UC. No definite conclusions could be drawn for unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), protein and energy intake due to limited and/or inconsistent results. Six studies reported on diet and relapse risk, of which only two (n = 1 UC, n = 1 CD) had a prospective follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence is not sufficient to draw firm conclusions on the role of specific food components or nutrients in the aetiology of IBD. Furthermore, large prospective studies into the role of habitual diet as a trigger of relapses are needed, to identify new therapeutic or preventive targets.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known of the importance of chromogranins (Cg) and secretogranins (Sg) in ulcerative colitis (UC). We therefore investigated fecal levels of CgA, CgB, SgII and SgIII, and their association with inflammatory activity, disease duration and medical therapy in UC. METHODS: Analyses of CgA, CgB, SgII, SgIII and calprotectin in stool samples from 41 UC patients and 29 healthy controls were performed. Two stool samples, during relapse and remission, respectively, were obtained from each UC patient. RESULTS: The levels of fecal CgA and SgII were higher in UC patients with active disease as compared to healthy controls. CgB and SgII were positively correlated with disease duration, but none of the granins were positively correlated with calprotectin, Mayo score, CRP or serum concentrations of TNF in UC patients with active disease. Also UC patients in remission had higher levels of CgA, CgB, SgII, and SgIII as compared to healthy controls. However, levels of fecal CgA, CgB, SgII and SgIII were lower during active disease relative to remission. Moreover, fecal levels of CgA and SgII were higher in UC patients in remission treated with thiopurines than in thiopurine-naive patients in remission. CONCLUSION: Fecal chromogranins and secretogranins are increased in UC but are not associated with disease activity, but seem to increase with duration of the disease. Thus, fecal granins might reflect structural changes associated with chronicity of disease, or medical therapy.},

The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that inflammation affects the expression of Fe-related proteins in the duodenum and monocytes of patients with chronic inflammatory disorders, thus contributing to dysregulated Fe homeostasis. Duodenal mucosal samples and peripheral blood monocytes obtained from patients with chronic inflammatory disorders, namely ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and rheumatoid arthritis, were used for gene and protein expression studies. Hb levels were significantly lower and serum C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in patients in the disease groups. The gene expression of several Fe-related proteins in the duodenum was significantly up-regulated in patients with UC and CD. In patients with UC, the protein expression of divalent metal transporter 1 and ferroportin, which are involved in the absorption of dietary non-haem Fe, was also found to be significantly higher in the duodenal mucosa. The gene expression of the duodenal proteins of interest correlated positively with one another and negatively with Hb. In patients with UC, the gene expression of Fe-related proteins in monocytes was found to be unaffected. In a separate group of patients with UC, serum hepcidin levels were found to be significantly lower than those in the control group. In conclusion, the expression of Fe-related proteins was up-regulated in the duodenum of patients with chronic inflammatory conditions in the present study. The effects appeared to be secondary to anaemia and the consequent erythropoietic drive.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Presently, there is no consensus on endpoint measures to assess clinical outcomes for pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). This study reviewed the endpoints used in the registration trials of approved drugs for pediatric UC. METHODS: The primary efficacy endpoints of all registration trials completed from 1950 to 2008 that led to Food and Drug Administration approval for indications in pediatric and adult UC were reviewed. RESULTS: Colazal and Remicade have been approved for pediatric UC indication, and clinical response was used as a primary endpoint in these registration trials. The clinical response in the adult Colazal trials was defined as a reduction of rectal bleeding and improvement in at least one of the other assessed symptoms (stool frequency, patient functional assessment, abdominal pain, sigmoidoscopic grade, and physician's global assessment) assessed by the Sutherland UC Activity Index. The pediatric Colazal trial defined clinical response using the Modified Sutherland UC Activity Index, which excluded abdominal pain and functional assessment. Both adult and pediatric Remicade trials used clinical response defined by the Mayo score as the primary endpoint. The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index was used to measure various secondary endpoints in the pediatric Remicade trial. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric-specific endpoints were used, but outcome measures and definition of clinical response were not consistent in pediatric UC trials. Consensus on the definition of successful treatment outcome (clinical response and/or remission) and collaboration in the development of well-defined and reliable measures of signs and symptoms for use in conjunction with endoscopic parameters of mucosal healing will facilitate pediatric drug development.},

METHODS: Representatives from the US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, Health Canada, and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan convened monthly to explore existing regulatory approaches, reviewed the results of a literature search, and provided perspectives on pediatric UC drug development based on the available medical literature. RESULTS: Although pediatric UC, when compared with UC in adults, has a similar disease progression and response to intervention, the similarity of the exposure-response relation has not been adequately established. Consequently, clinical endpoints should be selected to optimally assess efficacy in children. The inclusion of a placebo control in pediatric trials to assure assay sensitivity may be appropriate under limited circumstances. In clinical studies, although the drug under investigation could provide possible direct benefit, placebo treatment should present no more than a minor increase over minimal risk to children with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Partial extrapolation of efficacy from informative adult studies may be appropriate. Placebo-controlled efficacy trials are scientifically and ethically appropriate for pediatric UC given appropriate patient selection and the use of early escape. Clinical studies in pediatric UC may include initial dose-finding studies and exposure-response modeling followed by an efficacy and safety study to further explore the exposure-response relation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There is a pressing need for drug development in pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). Lack of scientific consensus on efficacy endpoints and disease outcome assessments presents a hurdle for global drug development in pediatric UC. Scientists from 4 regulatory agencies convened an International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Working Group (i-IBD Working Group) to harmonize present thinking about various aspects of drug development in pediatric UC globally. METHODS: The i-IBD Working Group was convened in 2012 by scientists from the US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, Health Canada, and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan. The members of this group considered reasons for differences in their acceptance of efficacy endpoints and disease activity indices used in pediatric UC, reviewed the available literature, and developed consensus opinions regarding approaches for evaluating outcomes in pediatric UC trials. RESULTS: There is lack of harmonization in using efficacy endpoint and outcome assessments including disease activity indices to assess clinical benefit in pediatric UC trials. Many disease activity indices have been developed, but their biometric properties, such as responsiveness, reliability, and validity, have not been properly validated. Biomarkers, such as fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin, are being investigated for their potential as noninvasive surrogate endpoints in UC. CONCLUSIONS: Consensus on the efficacy endpoints, disease activity indices, and outcome assessments is needed for globalization of pediatric UC trials. The i-IBD Working Group offers several perspectives to facilitate harmonization across regions. The development of noninvasive biomarkers as reliable surrogate endpoints needs to be explored further.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammation-associated disease of the colon and rectum. The onset and progress of the disease are directly influenced by the nature of the intestinal microflora, the intestinal barrier function, and the immunological responses of the host. The epithelial invasion of pathogenic bacteria due to excess contact and/or barrier dysfunction is related to inflammation mediated by intestinal immune responses. Although the etiology of UC is not clearly understood, recent studies have shown a rising incidence of UC worldwide, and this phenomenon is more prominent in Asian countries and in Asian immigrants in Western countries. The increased prevalence of UC also contributes to an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Environmental factors, including changes in dietary habits, have been suggested as major risk factors of UC. A systematic review showed a negative association between UC risk and vegetable intake, whereas total fat, omega-6 fatty acids and meat intake were positively associated with an increased risk of UC. Individual dietary factors and energy balance have been suggested as having important roles in inducing changes in the microbial population and intestinal barrier integrity and in regulating inflammatory immune responses, directly or indirectly. Excess energy intake is now known to increase pathogenic microbial populations. Likewise, the application of appropriate probiotics may reverse the pathogenic progression of the disease. In the meantime, dietary anti-inflammatory compounds, including omega-3 fatty acids and other phytochemicals, may directly suppress inflammatory responses in the course of UC development. In this review, the increased prevalence of UC and its management are interpreted from the standpoint of nutritional modulation to regulate the intestinal microflora population, intestinal epithelium permeability, and inflammatory responses.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation in the absence of a recognized etiology. The primary therapies are medications that possess anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects. Given the high use of complementary alternative medicines in pediatric IBD, a prospective tolerability study of curcumin, an herbal therapy with known anti-inflammatory effects, was conducted to assess possible dosage in children with IBD. METHODS: Prospectively, patients with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis in remission or with mild disease (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] <30 or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [PUCAI] score <34) were enrolled in a tolerability study. All patients received curcumin in addition to their standard therapy. Patients initially received 500 mg twice per day for 3 weeks. Using the forced-dose titration design, doses were increased up to 1 g twice per day at week 3 for a total of 3 weeks and then titrated again to 2 g twice per day at week 6 for 3 weeks. Validated measures of disease activity, using the PUCAI and PCDAI, and the Monitoring of Side Effect System score were obtained at weeks 3, 6, and 9. RESULTS: All patients tolerated curcumin well, with the only symptom that was consistently reported during all 3 visits being an increase in gassiness, which occurred in only 2 patients. Three patients saw improvement in PUCAI/PCDAI score. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that curcumin may be used as an adjunctive therapy for individuals seeking a combination of conventional medicine and alternative medicine.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammation of long-term ulcerative colitis contributes to an increased risk of colon cancer. Few studies address whether extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake suppresses inflammation, cell proliferation and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) in the experimental colitis model. The aim of this study was to assess whether a 5% EVOO suppressed inflammation, increased cell proliferation and the expressions of STAT3 and STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Rats were administered DSS via drinking water (weight percentage: 4%) for 1 week with a 1-week recovery period for three cycles. Rats were divided into three groups: control group, standard diet without DSS; DSS group, standard diet+DSS; and DSS+EVOO group, EVOO diet (weight percentage: 5%)+DSS. Rats were sacrificed 5 weeks after DSS was first administered, and colonic damage was histologically and biochemically evaluated. As a result, chronic feeding of 5% EVOO attenuated inflammation. This was evaluated using a disease activity index, body weight loss and a histological score. Enhanced expressions of STAT3, pSTAT3, COX-2 and iNOS by DSS was attenuated by EVOO. In addition, EVOO attenuated increases in cell proliferation (PCNA) caused by DSS and recovered decreases in apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3). In conclusion, the study indicated that chronic feeding of 5% EVOO inhibited chronic inflammation in DSS-induced colitis in rats and also attenuated cell proliferation and recovered apoptosis in DSS colitis.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide a synopsis on established and new research evaluating bone disease in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). RECENT FINDINGS: Persons with IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are believed to be at high risk for osteoporosis and fracture. As osteoporosis is clinically silent and persons with IBD are not universally screened, the burden of bone disease in IBD has been difficult to accurately assess. It is also unclear whether bone disease is due to inflammatory activity, medication use, poor nutrient intake/absorption, or body habitus characteristics. Recent studies using population-wide databases of bone mineral density (BMD) analyses suggest that Crohn's disease is responsible for a small effect on BMD after adjusting for other risk factors for low BMD, whereas ulcerative colitis does not appear to confer an independent risk. Furthermore, IBD does not appear to be a risk for overall fracture once controlling for factors which are associated with both IBD and fracture risk. The ability to assess BMD on incidentally performed computed tomography scans may allow detection of low BMD in IBD patients. SUMMARY: Although reduced BMD and fracture are more common in persons with IBD, the precise burden is not well characterized. Also, the relative impact of IBD-associated factors and IBD-specific inflammation on bone health is still uncertain.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease has been shown to affect children's health-related quality of life (HRQOL) through the use of lengthy questionnaires. We examined whether a pediatric patient's HRQOL, measured by a rapid visual analog scale ("feeling thermometer"), correlates with the perceptions of the HRQOL as determined by the patient's pediatric gastroenterologist and parent(s). Additionally, we attempted to determine whether the HRQOL correlates with the patient's disease activity as determined by validated activity indices. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of pediatric patients (ages 7-21 years) who were diagnosed as having Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, or indeterminate colitis was conducted from January 2011 to May 2011. Each participant (patient, parent(s), and treating pediatric gastroenterologist) completed feeling thermometers to determine the symptom burden as well as therapeutic burden of the patient. The parent(s) and doctor were blinded to the patient's results. Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index or a Short Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (S-PCDAI) was calculated. Correlations between the participant's perceived burdens as well as their calculated disease activity were determined. RESULTS: Sixty-seven children and their families participated, resulting in 101 visits. Patients had a mean age of 15.0 years, and there were 38 boys. There was a strong significant correlation between the patient's perceived symptom burden and that of the parent's (rho 0.59, P < 0.001) and physician (rho 0.48, P < 0.001). Similarly, there was a strong significant correlation between patient's perceived treatment burden and that of the parent treatment burden (rho 0.49, P < 0.001) and, to a lesser degree, the physician (rho 0.29, P < 0.003). The correlation coefficient was strongest between the physician's perception of the patient's symptom burden against the standard disease activity indices Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (rho 0.69, P < 0.001) and Short Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (rho 0.65, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The patient's HRQOL was highly correlated to both the physician's and parent's perceptions as well as their disease activity. The feeling thermometer is a quick, easy-to-use, visual analog scale that can be implemented in everyday practice to measure a pediatric patient's HRQOL.},

However, some patients may experience morbid obesity and associated complications refractory to dietary treatment and benefit from bariatric surgery. It has even been postulated that surgery may result in improvement of IBD by reducing inflammatory markers (2). However, patients may experience a higher incidence of complications following surgery in the context of immunosuppressive therapy and prior malabsorption. Therefore, if surgery is performed, careful patient selection and individualization of technique are essential. We present a patient diagnosed with ulcerative colitis who presented severe protein malnutrition after bariatric surgery type bilio-pancreatic diversion and review the available literature.},

   abstract = {Whole-grain foods such as oats may protect against colorectal cancer and have benefits on inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease. The present study aimed to systematically review the literature describing intervention studies that investigated the effects of oats or oat bran on risk factors for bowel disease. A literature search was conducted using Embase, Medline and the Cochrane library, which identified 654 potential articles. Thirty-eight articles describing twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Two studies carried out in participants with a history of colorectal adenomas found no effects of increased oat-bran intake on indirect risk makers for colorectal cancer. One of two interventions with oat bran in patients with ulcerative colitis showed small improvements in the patients' conditions. Most of the eleven studies carried out in adults with coeliac disease showed no negative effects of uncontaminated oat consumption. The fourteen studies carried out in volunteers with no history of bowel disease suggest that oats or oat bran can significantly increase stool weight and decrease constipation, but there is a lack of evidence to support a specific effect of oats on bowel function compared with other cereals. A long-term dietary intake of oats or oat bran could benefit inflammatory bowel disorders, but this remains to be proven. A protective effect on colorectal adenoma and cancer incidence has not yet been convincingly shown. The majority of patients with coeliac disease could consume up to 100 g/d of uncontaminated oats, which would increase the acceptability of, and adherence to, a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In animal models, excess luminal iron exacerbates colonic inflammation and cancer development. Moreover, in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with mild to moderate disease activity dietary fortificant iron intake is inversely related to quality of life. Here we sought to determine whether dietary iron intakes were also related to quality of life in IBD patients in remission. METHODS: Forty eight patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 42 of which had quiescent disease during this observational study, and 53 healthy control subjects completed quality of life questionnaires and 7-day food diaries. For comparative analysis, 34/group were matched and the linear relationship between dietary iron intakes (total, haem, non-haem or fortificant) and EuroQol quality of life measures was investigated. For UC patients the linear relationship between dietary iron intakes and the scores from the disease specific inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) was also considered. RESULTS: The intake of dietary iron, and its various sub-fractions, were not associated with quality of life (EuroQol) in patients with quiescent disease or in healthy control subjects. The picture was similar for the 42 quiescent UC patients when disease-specific IBDQ was used. However, the 6 patients who relapsed during the study again showed an inverse association between IBDQ and dietary iron intake (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that dietary iron does not impact on quality of life in quiescent UC patients but support that, once the disease is triggered, luminal iron may be a permissive factor for exacerbation of disease activity resulting in lower quality of life.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Allergic colitis shows overlap with classic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Clinically, allergic colitis is associated with dysmotility and abdominal pain, and mucosal eosinophilia is characteristic. We thus aimed to characterise mucosal changes in children with allergic colitis compared with normal tissue and classic IBD, focusing on potential interaction between eosinophils and mast cells with enteric neurones. METHODS: A total of 15 children with allergic colitis, 10 with Crohn disease (CD), 10 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 10 histologically normal controls were studied. Mucosal biopsies were stained for CD3 T cells, Ki-67, eotaxin-1, and eotaxin-2. Eotaxin-2, IgE, and tryptase were localised compared with mucosal nerves, using neuronal markers neurofilament protein, neuron-specific enolase, and nerve growth factor receptor. RESULTS: Overall inflammation was greater in patients with CD and UC than in patients with allergic colitis. CD3 T-cell density was increased in patients with allergic colitis, similar to that in patients with CD but lower than in patients with UC, whereas eosinophil density was higher than in all other groups. Eotaxin-1 and -2 were localised to basolateral crypt epithelium in all specimens, with eotaxin-1+ lamina propria cells found in all of the colitis groups. Eotaxin-2+ intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) density was significantly higher in allergic colitis specimens than in all other groups. Mast cell degranulation was strikingly increased in patients with allergic colitis (12/15) compared with that in patients with UC (1/10) and CD (0/1). Tryptase and IgE colocalised on enteric neurons in patients with allergic colitis but rarely in patients with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Eotaxin-2+ IELs may contribute to the periepithelial eosinophil accumulation characteristic of allergic colitis. The colocalisation of IgE and tryptase with mucosal enteric nerves is likely to promote the dysmotility and visceral hyperalgesia classically seen in allergic gastrointestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) represents a therapeutic modality that could save the life of a patient with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) facing severe nutritional problems, by restoring the patient's impaired nutritional status. TPN does not compete with enteral nutrition (EN), the latter being the first choice for all patients having anatomically intact and functionally normal digestive tract. TPN allows bowel rest while supplying adequate calorific intake and essential nutrients, and removes antigenic mucosal stimuli. The value of TPN in malnourished patients with intestinal failure due to CD is beyond doubt. However, it is difficult to suggest TPN as a sole treatment for active CD. An increased rate of remission could not be expected by applying TPN. The utility of TPN is restricted to certain cases involving efforts to close enterocutaneous or other complicated fistulas in patients with fistulizing CD, the treatment of short bowel syndrome following extensive resections for CD, or when EN is impractical for other reasons. There are no advantages of TPN therapy over EN therapy regarding fistula healing. TPN has no influence on the surgical intervention rate and little benefit by bypassing the intestinal passage could be expected. Also TPN shows no advantage if the disease is chronically active. However, an optimal supply of nutrients improves bowel motility, intestinal permeability and nutritional status, and reduces inflammatory reactions. TPN might be associated with an increased risk of adverse events, although TPN undertaken by experienced teams does not cause more complications than does EN.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic gastrointestinal disorder, is a debilitating disease affecting many people across the globe. Research suggests that the levels of several antioxidants, including beta-carotene (beta-CAR), decrease in the serum of patients with UC. The present study was aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in beta-CAR-mediated protection against UC in mice. METHODS: UC was induced in mice using 3%w/v dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water for two cycles; one cycle comprised of 7 days of dextran sulfate sodium-treated water followed by 14 days of normal drinking water. beta-CAR was administered at the doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg bw/day, po throughout the experiment. The effect of beta-CAR in mice with UC was evaluated using biochemical parameters, histological evaluation, comet and micronucleus assays, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: The results indicated that beta-CAR treatment ameliorated the severity of UC by modulating various molecular targets such as nuclear factor-kappa B, cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin 17, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and connective tissue growth factor. Further, beta-CAR treatment maintained the gut integrity by increasing the expression of a tight junction protein, occludin, which was decreased in the colon of mice with UC. Also beta-CAR treatment significantly reduced UC-associated elevated plasma lipopolysaccharide level, systemic inflammation and genotoxicity. CONCLUSION: beta-CAR ameliorated UC-associated local and systemic damage in mice by acting on multiple targets.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In the era of modern multidisciplinary clinical management, very little is known about the prevalence and presentation of malnutrition in children with gastrointestinal disorders (GastroD) particularly employing composite, global measures of nutritional status. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Anthropometry, body composition, dietary intake, eating habits and grip strength were assessed with bedside methods in 168 patients from outpatient gastroenterology clinics (n, median (IQR) years; Crohn's disease (CD): n=53, 14.2 (11.6:15.4); ulcerative colitis (UC): n=27, 12.2 (10.7:14.2); coeliac disease: n=31, 9.3 (7.5:13.6); other GastroD: n=57, 9.8 (7.2:13.8)) and compared with 62 contemporary healthy controls (n, median (IQR): 9.8 (6.9:13.8)) and the results of the recent UK, National Diet and Nutritional Survey (NDNS). RESULTS: Children with CD had lower BMI z-scores than controls (median (IQR): -0.3 (-0.9:0.4) vs 0.3 (-0.6:1.4); P=0.02) but only 2% were classified as thin (BMI z-score <-2 s.d.). The prevalence of obesity in children with UC was 19%, 6% in CD, 11% in children with other GastroD and 15% in controls. No difference was found in grip strength measurement between groups. Except for CD children, the proportion of patients with suboptimal micronutrient intake was similar to that of controls and the cohort of children from the latest NDNS. A higher proportion of children with CD had suboptimal intake for riboflavin, vitamin B6 and calcium and consumed significantly more meat products, juices (including carbonated drinks), spreads/jams and crisps and savoury snacks and significantly fewer portions of dairy, fish, fruits and vegetables compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: GastroD affect children's body composition, growth, strength, dietary intake and eating habits, particularly CD, but to a lesser extent than expected.},

   abstract = {Approximately half of the children with ulcerative colitis (UC) have refractory, relapsing or steroid-dependent disease. UC in children is more extensive than in adults, presents more often with severe attacks and carries a more aggressive disease course. Therefore, although a step-up approach is usually recommended in UC, aggressive therapy will often be indicated in children since steroid dependency should never be tolerated. It is vital to ensure that in every resistant case, the symptoms are truly related to the inflammatory disease activity and not to other conditions such as poor adherence to treatment, infections, adverse reactions to drugs, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, celiac disease and bacterial overgrowth. The clinician should be ready to escalate therapy in a timely manner but only after ensuring optimization of current treatments. Optimization may include, among others, appropriate dosage, utilization of assays that determine thiopurine, calcineurin inhibitors and anti-tumor necrosis factor levels, introduction of combination therapy when indicated (enemas and immunomodulators) and a long enough time for treatment to become effective. Colectomy is always a valid option and should be discussed before major treatment escalations. Experimental therapies can be considered when all else fails and the family prefers to avoid colectomy. The management of refractory and relapsing disease is particularly challenging in children, and this review summarizes the available evidence to guide treatment decisions in this setup.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The results of previous studies on the effectiveness of antibiotics in ulcerative colitis (UC) seem more effective when used orally. In this retrospective, multicenter study, we aimed to report our experience of using a combination of 3-4 antibiotics in children with moderate-severe refractory UC and IBD-unclassified including metronidazole, amoxicillin, doxycycline, and if during hospital admission, also vancomycin (MADoV). METHODS: All children treated during 2013 with the antibiotic cocktail for 2-3weeks in an attempt to alleviate inflammation in refractory colitis were included. Doxycycline was substituted with oral gentamycin or ciprofloxacin in children younger than 8years or when an allergy was known to one of the drugs. Children were assessed using the PUCAI and CRP weekly for 3weeks. RESULTS: All 15 included children had moderate to severe disease with refractory disease course to multiple immunosuppressants (mean age 13.6+/-5.1years, median disease duration 2 (IQR 0.8-3.2) years, 11 females (73%), and 13 (87%) extensive disease; 14 (93%) were corticosteroid-dependent or resistant, and 12 (80%) refractory to anti-TNF therapy). The cocktail was definitely effective in 7 of the 15 included children (47%) who entered complete clinical remission (PUCAI<10) without additional interventions. Questionable or partial short-term response was noted in another 3 (20%), totaling 67% of patients. CONCLUSION: The use of oral wide-spectrum antibiotic cocktail in pediatric UC seems promising in half of patients, refractory to other salvage therapy. A pediatric randomized controlled trial to assess this intervention is underway.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic enterocolitis (EEC) is an emerging distinct inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology. There are no published data on the effect of infliximab (IFX) or adalimumab (ADA) for the treatment of refractory cases. METHODS: A report of all pediatric cases with EEC treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor, identified after an open international call. RESULTS: We describe here the first 8 children with refractory EEC who were treated with IFX (75% boys; mean age at diagnosis 8.6 +/- 4.03 [range 1.6-14 years]; mean age at IFX treatment 11.7 +/- 4.4 [range 4.2-16 years]). Allergic and infectious causes of EEC were excluded in all cases. Rapid and complete clinical remission was documented in 6 (75%) children following the induction infusions: 3 (38%) with endoscopic remission, 2 (25%) with endoscopic improvement, and 1 unknown. Four of the 6 responders had secondary loss of response and were switched to ADA, 3 of whom with sustained remission using high doses. Overall, the 6 responders were followed for a median of 7 years (range 4-12; interquartile range 6.4-8.8 years) without evidence of developing Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. The only case with macroscopic findings on endoscopy was a primary nonresponder. CONCLUSIONS: IFX and ADA may be effective in cases of refractory idiopathic EEC; however, because this is an uncontrolled report, further prospective studies are warranted.},

Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of ADA in treating ambulatory UC patients in primary gastroenterology centers. METHODS: Fifteen patients (6 male, median age 29.9 years, range 22.8-39.9 years) were enrolled. All were previously treated with infliximab (IFX). Clinical activity and endoscopic severity were scored according to the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) score and Mayo subscore for endoscopy, respectively. Patients were clinically assessed at weeks 4, 8, and thereafter at weeks 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 54. Colonoscopy was performed before starting treatment, at weeks 24 and 54. The co-primary endpoints were clinical remission at 24 and 54 weeks. The secondary endpoints included: 1) sustained clinical remission; 2) steroid-sparing effect; 3) mucosal healing; 4) need for colectomy. Induction dose of ADA was 160 mg at week 0, and then 80 mg at week 2, while ADA maintenance treatment was 40 mg every two weeks. RESULTS: Clinical remission was obtained in 11 (73.3%) and 15 (100%) patients at weeks 24 and 54 respectively. Ten patients (66.7%) were able to discontinue steroids and were under corticosteroid-free remission at week 54. No patients underwent to colectomy. Eight patients (53.33%) at week 24 and 9 patients (60%) at week 54 achieved complete mucosal healing (Mayo endoscopic score 0). Side effects were reported in 2 of 15 patients (13.3%); none of those patients stopped treatment. CONCLUSION: ADA seems to be effective and safe in UC outpatients affected by UC, and previously treated with IFX.},

METHODS: One hundred and eighteen patients (65 M, 63 F, median age 34 years, range 19-71 years), affected by UC, were treated with IFX. Clinical efficacy, safety, mucosal healing (MH), and histological healing (HH) were assessed at a scheduled follow-up of 42 months. RESULTS: Percentage of patients with clinical remission persistence at 42-month follow-up was 70.4%. Colectomy occurred in only 3 patients (2.7%). At 42-month follow-up percentage of patients with MH was 44.6%, and percentage of patients with HH was 24.3%. HH at 6-month follow-up occurred in 13 out of 34 patients (38.2%) with C-reactive protein (CRP) <3 and in 8 out of 76 patients (10.5%) with CRP >/= 3 (p=0.002). Side effects were reported in 16 patients (13.6%): infusion reactions occurred in 7 patients, other severe side-effects occurred in 3 patients, and opportunistic infections occurred in 3 patients (2.5%). Finally, 3 cancers (2.5%) occurred during the follow-up period (1 breast, 1 kidney and 1 rectal cancer). Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed Hb <11.5 g/dL and HH at 6-month follow-up to be significantly associated with treatment failure during follow-up.

This study investigated the effects of substitution of linoleic acid with long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and hence decreasing n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio on inflammatory response in dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis. Male weanling Sprague Dawley rats were fed diets with n-6:n-3 fatty acid in the ratios of 215,50,10 or 5 for 3 months and colitis was induced by administration of dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water during last 11 days. Decreasing the dietary n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio to 10 and 5 significantly attenuated the severity of colitis as evidenced by improvements in clinical symptoms, reversal of shortening of colon length, reduced severity of anemia, preservation of colonic architecture as well as reduced colonic mucosal myeloperoxidase activity. This protection was associated with suppression of colonic mucosal proinflammatory mediators such as TNFalpha, IL-1beta and nitric oxide. These findings suggest that long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids at a level of 3.0 g/kg diet (n-6:n-3 ratio of 10) prevents dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis by suppressing the proinflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {Patients with a diverse spectrum of rare genetic disorders can present with inflammatory bowel disease (monogenic IBD). Patients with these disorders often develop symptoms during infancy or early childhood, along with endoscopic or histological features of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or IBD unclassified. Defects in interleukin-10 signaling have a Mendelian inheritance pattern with complete penetrance of intestinal inflammation. Several genetic defects that disturb intestinal epithelial barrier function or affect innate and adaptive immune function have incomplete penetrance of the IBD-like phenotype. Several of these monogenic conditions do not respond to conventional therapy and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Due to the broad spectrum of these extremely rare diseases, a correct diagnosis is frequently a challenge and often delayed. In many cases, these diseases cannot be categorized based on standard histological and immunologic features of IBD. Genetic analysis is required to identify the cause of the disorder and offer the patient appropriate treatment options, which include medical therapy, surgery, or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In addition, diagnosis based on genetic analysis can lead to genetic counseling for family members of patients. We describe key intestinal, extraintestinal, and laboratory features of 50 genetic variants associated with IBD-like intestinal inflammation. In addition, we provide approaches for identifying patients likely to have these disorders. We also discuss classic approaches to identify these variants in patients, starting with phenotypic and functional assessments that lead to analysis of candidate genes. As a complementary approach, we discuss parallel genetic screening using next-generation sequencing followed by functional confirmation of genetic defects.},

However, little is known regarding its effects in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, which are related to dysfunction of intestinal immunity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of WBMs in an animal model of DSS-induced colitis. Male, 4-week-old ICR mice (n=10 per group) were fed a normal diet with or without 10% WBM for 4 weeks, and colitis was induced by 3% DSS in drinking water for 7 days. WBMs prevented DSS-induced shortening of colon length (P=.033) and diminished diarrhea (P=.049) and gross bleeding (P=.001), resulting in a decreased disease activity index. Results of histological analysis showed that WBMs suppressed mucosal damage. In addition, WBMs attenuated the DSS-induced increase in myeloperoxidase activity (P=.012) and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P=.020) in the colon segment. Taken together, these findings suggest a possible role for the WBM as an immunomodulator that can prevent and/or treat ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is often associated with nutritional deficiency, which appears to contribute to the progression of UC severity. The present study aimed to evaluate nutritional status and dietary intake in UC remission patients. METHODS: The present study comprised a cross-sectional study in which variables such as extent of disease (distal colitis, left-sided colitis, pancolitis), remission period, sex and age were recorded. Extent of disease was assessed by the results of a colonoscopy and dietary intake was evaluated by using 3-day, 24-h recalls. A Kruskall-Wallis test was used to compare the intake of macro- and micronutrients among the three study groups. The analysis was complemented by the Mann-Whitney test. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictive factors of extent of disease (pancolitis versus left-sided colitis versus distal colitis). RESULTS: The median (range) age of the 59 patients was 49.0 (37.0-63.0) years and 53.3% were female. Twenty-six (44.1%) patients had distal colitis, 11 (18.6%) patients had left-sided colitis and 22 (37.3%) patients had pancolitis. A high probability of an inadequate intake of fibre (100%), fat soluble vitamins (>40% for vitamin A and >95% for vitamin E), vitamin C (>34%), calcium (>90%) and magnesium (>50%) was identified in the study group. Vitamin D intake (odds ratio = 0.60; 95% confidence interval = 0.39-0.94; P < 0.05) was significantly associated with increased intestinal damage. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of individuals showed an inadequate intake of nutrients. In addition, the consumption of vitamin D was significantly associated with extent of disease.},

METHODS: A total of 47 patients with IBD (25 ulcerative colitis, 14 Crohn's disease, and 8 indeterminate colitis) ages 3 to 17 years were compared with 50 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Screening for hepatitis A and B serology was carried out before vaccination. Susceptible cases received 20 mg of recombinant DNA vaccine for hepatitis B (0, 1, and 6 months)and 720 milliELISA units of inactivated hepatitis A virus vaccine (HAV) (0 and 6 months). Postvaccination serologic evaluation was performed 1 month after the last dose of primary vaccination, 1 month after the booster dose, and once every year during follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients and 35 controls received HAV and protective anti-HAV antibodies were developed in all of the patients and controls (P =1.00). Forty-seven patients and 50 controls received hepatitis B vaccine and 70.2% of the patients versus 90% of the controls achieved seroprotection(anti-HBs titers 10 mIU/mL) 1 month after primary vaccination (95% confidence interval 0.71-0.87, P = 0.02). The overall seroprotection rates were 96% in controls and 85.1% in patients after the whole hepatitis B vaccination series (95% confidence interval 0.83-0.95, P = 0.08). No significant reduction was observed in antibody response among patients and controls during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of seroconversion to the hepatitis B vaccine was lower in pediatric patients with IBD than in healthy controls and hepatitis A vaccine was highly immunogenic among patients with IBD.},

METHODS: A retrospective investigation was conducted on a cohort of newly diagnosed children and adolescents with IBD ages 0 to 18 years between 2002 and 2010 and residing in NE Slovenia. The phenotypic characteristics were determined at presentation and during follow-up. The location of Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was assessed according to the Paris classification at diagnosis, and later in patients who had a follow-up period >2 years. The type of therapy at diagnosis and during follow-up, and the need for surgery were determined. The study covered approximately one-third of the total pediatric population (0-18 years). RESULTS: In total, 107 cases of IBD were diagnosed during the study period. The mean annual incidence (per 100,000) was 7.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.3-9.2) for all IBD, 4.6 (95% CI 3.6-5.9) for CD, and 2.8 (95% CI 1.9-3.8) for UC. The incidences of total IBD, CD, and UC increased from 5.7 (3.8-8.2), 3.9 (2.3-6.1), and 1.8 (0.8-3.5) in the period 2002-2004, respectively, to 8.9 (6.3-12.2), 5.0 (3.1-7.6), and 3.4 (1.9-5.6) in the period 2008-2010, respectively. During the follow-up, the proportion of complicated CD disease behavior (stricturing/penetrating) had doubled. A total of 18.5% of patients with CD underwent bowel surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of childhood IBD in the northeastern part of the country is high and comparable with that reported from the developed western countries of Europe, and is probably still increasing. This increase may be the result of changes in the lifestyle, especially in dietary habits during the last 20 years.},

   abstract = {Although the significance of focally enhanced gastritis (FEG) as a marker of Crohn disease (CD) in adults has been contested, several studies suggest that it may be more specific of CD in pediatric patients. This study describes the detailed histologic features of FEG in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and clarifies its association with CD. A series of 119 consecutive newly diagnosed IBD patients (62 CD cases, 57 ulcerative colitis [UC] cases) with upper and lower gastrointestinal biopsies were evaluated. The histology of the gastric biopsies was reviewed blinded to final diagnoses and compared with age-matched healthy controls (n=66). FEG was present in 43% of IBD patients (CD 55% vs. UC 30%, P=0.0092) and in 5% of controls. Among CD patients, FEG was more common in younger patients (73% in children aged 10 y and below, 43% in children above 10 y of age, P=0.0358), with the peak in the 5- to 10-year age group (80%). The total number of glands involved in each FEG focus was higher in UC (6.4+/-5.1 glands) than in CD (4.0+/-3.0 glands, P=0.0409). Amongst the CD cohort, patients with FEG were more likely than those without FEG to have active ileitis (79% vs. 40%, P=0.0128) and granulomas elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract (82% vs. 43%, P=0.0016). There was no correlation between FEG and other gastrointestinal findings of UC. We demonstrate that differences in FEG seen in pediatric CD and UC relate to not only their frequencies but also the morphology and relationship with other gastrointestinal lesions. Further, FEG is associated with disease activity and the presence of granulomas in pediatric CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cryptosporidiosis is usually a self-limiting illness in healthy patients. However, it can cause severe life threatening complications in immunocompromised patients. The effect of cryptosporidial infection on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been well studied and available literature is largely restricted to adult case reports. The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics of cryptosporidial infection in children with IBD. METHODS: Stool studies from children with IBD presenting with presumed relapse during the period 2005-2011 were reviewed retrospectively. Cryptosporidial infection was diagnosed by stool enzyme immunoassay. An age matched control group of IBD patients without cryptosporidial infection was used for comparison. RESULTS: Medical records of 170 IBD patients were reviewed and a total of 149 presumed relapses were identified. Cryptosporidial infection was found in seven of the 39 patients with positive stool studies (four ulcerative colitis/three Crohn's disease) presenting with relapse. The median age was 13 years (range: 3-17) and five patients were female. The median duration of the IBD was 18 months (range 2-48 months). All but one patient had stable disease prior to acquiring infection. Five patients required hospitalization due to significant dehydration. Three of the five patients treated with nitazoxanide had significant clinical improvement in 3 days. All patients had complete resolution of symptoms by three weeks and no infection related complications were noted. In comparison to patients with cryptosporidial infection, the control group required an increased need for escalation of therapy (71% vs. 0.0%, p=001) and higher re-hospitalization rates (24% Vs.0.0%, p=0.54) within 6 months following indexed relapse. CONCLUSION: In IBD patients, cryptosporidiosis can cause significant illness leading to increased need for hospitalization. In the absence of appropriate stool studies, cryptosporidiosis can be misdiagnosed as disease relapse and lead to inappropriate therapy. Nitazoxanide appears to be effective along with supportive therapy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan antibodies (ASCAs) have been detected in the serum of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and their unaffected family members. The aim of this study was to establish the value of serological markers as predictors of UC and CD. DESIGN: Individuals who developed CD or UC were identified from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. At recruitment, none of the participants had a diagnosis of CD or UC. For each incident case, two controls were randomly selected matched for centre, date of birth, sex, date of recruitment and time of follow-up. Serum of cases and controls obtained at recruitment were analysed for ASCA IgG, ASCA IgA, perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA), antibodies against Escherichia coli outer membrane porin C (OmpC) and flagellin CBir1. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine risk of CD and UC. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to test accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 77 individuals were diagnosed with CD and 167 with UC after a mean follow-up of 4.5 (SD 3.2) and 4.4 (SD 3.1) years following blood collection, respectively. Combinations of pANCA, ASCA, anti-CBir1 and anti-OmpC were most accurate in predicting incident CD and UC (area under curve 0.679 and 0.657, respectively). The predictive value of the combination of markers increased when time to diagnosis of CD or UC decreased. CONCLUSION: A panel of serological markers is able to predict development of CD and UC in individuals from a low-risk population.},

METHODS: The 74-item PedsQL GI Module and 23-item PedsQL Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 584 patients and 682 parents. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (such as chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease). RESULTS: Fourteen unidimensional scales were derived measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood, diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. The PedsQL GI Module Scales evidenced excellent feasibility, excellent reliability for the Total Scale Scores (patient self-report alpha = 0.97, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.97), and good-to-excellent reliability for the 14 individual scales (patient self-report alpha = 0.67-0.94, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.77-0.95). Intercorrelations with the Generic Core Scales supported construct validity. Individual Symptoms Scales known-groups validity across 7 GI disorders was generally supported. Factor analysis supported the unidimensionality of the individual scales. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL GI Module Scales demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent measurement properties and may be used as common metrics to compare GI-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice both within and across patient groups for FGIDs and organic GI diseases.},

STUDY DESIGN: The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 689 families. Patients had 1 of 7 physician-diagnosed GI disorders: chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The healthy control sample included 1114 families. School days missed, days in bed and needing care, parent missed workdays, work impact, and healthcare utilization were compared as well. RESULTS: Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease demonstrated lower HRQOL than the healthy controls across all dimensions (physical, emotional, social, and school; P < .001 for all), with larger effect sizes for patients with an FGID. Patients with an FGID manifested lower HRQOL than those with an organic GI disease. Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease missed more school, spent more days in bed and needing care, had greater healthcare utilization, and had parents who missed more workdays with greater work impact (P < .001 for most), with larger effect sizes for the patients with an FGID. CONCLUSION: Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease demonstrate impaired HRQOL compared with healthy children. HRQOL can be used as a common metric to compare patient outcomes in clinical research and practice both within and across groups of patients with FGIDs and organic GI diseases.},

   abstract = {Curcumin belongs to the family of natural compounds collectively called curcuminoids and it possesses remarkable beneficial anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and neuroprotective properties. Moreover it is commonly assumed that curcumin has also been suggested as a remedy for digestive diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), a chronic immune disorder affecting the gastrointestinal tract and that can be divided in two major subgroups: Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), depending mainly on the intestine tract affected by the inflammatory events. The chronic and intermittent nature of IBD imposes, where applicable, long-term treatments conducted in most of the cases combining different types of drugs. In more severe cases and where there has been no good response to the drugs, a surgery therapy is carried out. Currently, IBD-pharmacological treatments are generally not curative and often present serious side effects; for this reason, being known the relationship between nutrition and IBD, it is worthy of interesting the study and the development of new dietary strategy. The curcumin principal mechanism is the suppression of IBD inflammatory compounds (NF-kappaB) modulating immune response. This review summarizes literature data of curcumin as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant in IBD, trying to understand the different effects in CD e UC.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major phenotypes of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) which constitute a spectrum of chronic, debilitating diseases characterised by a relapsing inflammation of the intestinal mucosal lining. Evidence from a variety of disciplines implicates the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of idiopathic IBD and their complications, including pouchitis. Many studies have reported a dysbiosis in IBD, characterised by a decrease in diversity, a decreased abundance of some dominant commensal members (such as Clostridium IV and XIVa) and an increase in detrimental bacteria (such as sulphate reducing bacteria and Escherichia coli). Therapies such as prebiotics and probiotics aim to selectively manipulate the intestinal microbiota and have been evaluated as an attractive therapeutic option with few side effects. The multispecies product VSL#3 was found effective in preventing and maintaining remission in pouchitis, whereas both VSL#3 and E. coli Nissle were effective in maintaining remission in UC. A more drastic approach to restore the composition of the microbiota and correct the underlying imbalance is a faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT has been successfully applied to treat patients with even recalcitrant Clostridium difficile infection. Particularly in UC, the majority of studies suggest that FMT may be an effective treatment option although the evidence is still limited. It is anticipated that our increasing knowledge on the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota components will allow in the future for a better selection of highly performing bacteria with specific functions required for specific benefits.},

   abstract = {Loss of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) homeostasis and apoptosis negatively affect intestinal barrier function. Uncontrolled activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in IEC contributes to an impaired barrier and is implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the contribution of the UPR target gene C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), an apoptosis-associated transcription factor, to inflammation-related disease susceptibility remains unclear. Consistent with observations in patients with ulcerative colitis, we show that despite UPR activation in the epithelium, CHOP expression was reduced in mouse models of T-cell-mediated and bacteria-driven colitis. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of IEC-specific CHOP expression, we generated a conditional transgenic mouse model (Chop(IEC Tg/Tg)). Chop overexpression increased the susceptibility toward dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced intestinal inflammation and mucosal tissue injury. Furthermore, a delayed recovery from DSS-induced colitis and impaired closure of mechanically induced mucosal wounds was observed. Interestingly, these findings seemed to be independent of CHOP-mediated apoptosis. In vitro and in vivo cell cycle analyses rather indicated a role for CHOP in epithelial cell proliferation. In conclusion, these data show that IEC-specific overexpression impairs epithelial cell proliferation and mucosal tissue regeneration, suggesting an important role for CHOP beyond mediating apoptosis.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease that causes gastrointestinal lesions, bleeding, diarrhoea and nutritional complications. Insufficient nutrient intake can additionally deteriorate nutritional status. The present cross-sectional study aimed to determine whether UC patients adhere to national dietary guidelines and to assess their dietary habits. An online questionnaire (n 93) was used to assess health-related conditions, current nutritional knowledge, professional dietary guidance and food avoidance. A 24 h dietary recall (n 81) was used to assess nutrient intakes, which were then compared with the national recommended intake values. The results showed that the nutritional knowledge of participants was limited with unofficial sources being used, including websites. Numerous food groups, predominantly fibre-rich foods and fruit and vegetables, were largely avoided by the participants. Almost half of the study population eliminated foods such as dairy products to alleviate symptoms, possibly unnecessarily. Energy intakes were significantly (P< 0.05) lower than the national recommended intake values in women aged 18-65 years and men aged 18-60 years. Fat intake exceeded the national recommended intake values (P< 0.0001), at the expense of carbohydrate and fibre intakes, which were significantly (P< 0.005) lower than the national recommended intake values. Protein intake was significantly high in women aged 19-50 years (P< 0.00) and men aged 19-50 years (P< 0.005). Vitamin C, vitamin B12 and Ca intake levels were overachieved by all participants (P< 0.001), while women aged 19-50 years did not achieve their dietary Fe reference nutrient intake levels (P< 0.001). Osteopaenia, osteoporosis and anaemia were reported by 12, 6 and 31 % of the participants, respectively. Findings indicate that food avoidance may contribute to nutrient deficiencies in UC patients. Low intakes of these food groups, especially during remission, are preventing patients from adhering to dietary guidelines.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease and involves multiple etiological factors. Acetic acid (AA)-induced colitis is a reproducible and simple model, sharing many characteristics with human colitis. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been widely used as an antioxidant in vivo and in vitro. NAC can affect several signaling pathways involving in apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell growth and arrest, redox-regulated gene expression, and inflammatory response. Therefore, NAC may not only protect against the direct injurious effects of oxidants, but also beneficially alter inflammatory events in colitis. This study was conducted to investigate whether NAC could alleviate the AA-induced colitis in a porcine model. METHODS: Weaned piglets were used to investigate the effects of NAC on AA-induced colitis. Severity of colitis was evaluated by colon histomorphology measurements, histopathology scores, tissue myeloperoxidase activity, as well as concentrations of malondialdehyde and pro-inflammatory mediators in the plasma and colon. The protective role of NAC was assessed by measurements of antioxidant status, growth modulator, cell apoptosis, and tight junction proteins. Abundances of caspase-3 and claudin-1 proteins in colonic mucosae were determined by the Western blot method. Epidermal growth factor receptor, amphiregulin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mRNA levels in colonic mucosae were quantified using the real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, AA treatment increased (P < 0.05) the histopathology scores, intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) numbers and density in the colon, myeloperoxidase activity, the concentrations of malondialdehyde and pro-inflammatory mediators in the plasma and colon, while reducing (P < 0.05) goblet cell numbers and the protein/DNA ratio in the colonic mucosa. These adverse effects of AA were partially ameliorated (P < 0.05) by dietary supplementation with NAC. In addition, NAC prevented the AA-induced increase in caspase-3 protein, while stimulating claudin-1 protein expression in the colonic mucosa. Moreover, NAC enhanced mRNA levels for epidermal growth factor and amphiregulin in the colonic mucosa. CONCLUSION: Dietary supplementation with NAC can alleviate AA-induced colitis in a porcine model through regulating anti-oxidative responses, cell apoptosis, and EGF gene expression.},

A 17 year old XY female with a history of gonadal dysgenesis and sigmoid graft vaginoplasty presented with a history of bloody, mucoid vaginal discharge, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea and weight loss. Colonic and neovaginal biopsies demonstrated active colitis with diffuse ulcerations, consistent with ulcerative colitis. Despite aggressive immunosuppressive treatment she had persistent neovaginal and colonic bleeding requiring multiple transfusions, subtotal colectomy and ultimately completion proctectomy and neovaginectomy. It is imperative to recognize that colectomy alone may be an inadequate surgical intervention in patients with ulcerative colitis and a colonic neovaginal graft and that a concomitant neovaginectomy may be integral in providing appropriate treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary fiber may favorably influence fermentation, gastrointestinal inflammation, and disease progression in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and pouchitis and offer an attractive therapeutic addition to pharmacological treatment. This systematic review appraised data from randomized controlled trials of fiber in the management of inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The review followed Cochrane and PRISMA recommendations. Seven electronic databases were searched along with hand searching and contacting experts. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of the effects of fiber on clinical endpoints (primarily disease activity for treatment or maintenance) or physiological outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: In total, 23 randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria (UC, 10; Crohn's disease, 12; and pouchitis, 1) recruiting 1296 patients. In UC, 3/10 studies reported fiber supplementation to benefit disease outcomes. In Crohn's disease, 0/12 studies and in pouchitis 1/1 study reported a benefit on disease activity. Despite this, a number of studies reported favorable intragroup effects on physiological outcomes including fecal butyrate, fecal calprotectin, inflammatory cytokines, microbiota, and gastrointestinal symptom indices. Meta-analysis was not possible. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited weak evidence for the efficacy of fiber in improving disease outcomes in UC and pouchitis. The potential antiinflammatory role of fiber is intriguing and merits further investigation in adequately powered clinical trials. Excluding overt gastrointestinal obstruction, there was no evidence that fiber intake should be restricted in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Eosinophils contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the intestine. Eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) is one of the most important eosinophilic specific mediators released during activation. The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical value of serum ECP determination in children with active and inactive IBD and its correlation with disease activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 125 children with IBD (63 with Crohn's disease - CD, 44 with ulcerative colitis - UC, 18 indeterminate colitis - IC) enrolled in the study. Among them 83 children were in the active phase of the disease, while the remaining 42 were in remission. The control group consisted of 56 healthy children. The ECP was assessed three times in children with active IBD, at baseline and after 2 and 6 weeks of treatment and once in children with inactive IBD and controls using fluoroenzymeimmunoassays. RESULTS: We found elevated ECP at baseline in the total active IBD group when compared to the inactive IBD and control groups, decreasing during treatment. Serum ECP was also elevated in the active UC and CD groups when compared to the inactive UC and CD groups, and correlated with clinical UC and CD activity (R = 0.57 and R = 0.52, p < 0.05, respectively) and duration of the clinical manifestation in UC (R = 0.62, p < 0.05) but not with the disease location in the gastrointestinal tract, or endoscopic and histopathological activity. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of serum ECP in children with IBD may be useful in disease activity assessment at onset and during the treatment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The function of interleukin (IL)-37 has not been resolved. We recently showed that IL-37 suppresses colonic inflammation in mice. To gain more insight into its relevance in human disease, we investigated the expression of IL-37 in the intestine of pediatric patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Intestinal biopsies were obtained from children with IBD (18 Crohn disease [CD], 14 ulcerative colitis [UC] and 11 controls) during endoscopy and analyzed for IL-37 expression by immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results were correlated with immunostaining for IL-18 and IL-17, messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and clinical parameters. RESULTS: IL-37 protein was detected in epithelial cells and submucosal lymphoid cells of patients with CD and UC as well as healthy controls. IL-37 protein expression tended to be higher with submucosal lymphoid cell infiltration of patients with CD and UC and correlated with histological severity score of inflammation. IL-18 showed a staining pattern similar to that of IL-37, whereas staining for IL-17 revealed distinct positive cells scattered in the submucosal layer. mRNA expression of IL-8, IL-17, and IL-10 was upregulated in patients with CD and UC. mRNA levels of IL-18 and IL-37 were not significantly elevated compared with controls. Levels of IL-37 and IL-18 mRNA showed a positive correlation in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: IL-37 protein is expressed in healthy and diseased bowel tissue. IL-37 and IL-18 show a similar expression pattern and correlate at mRNA levels. Future studies are warranted to delineate the specific contribution of IL-37 to modulate chronic bowel inflammation in humans.},

   abstract = {AIM: To determine whether temporal changes occurred in the pediatric vs adult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), both in terms of number and type of yearly published articles. METHODS: We aimed to evaluate all PubMed-registered articles related to the field of IBD from January 1, 1993 and until December 31, 2011. We searched for articles using the key words "inflammatory bowel disease" or "Crohn's disease" or "ulcerative colitis" or "undetermined colitis", using the age filters of "child" or "adult". We repeated the search according to the total number per year of articles per type of article, for each year of the specified period. We studied randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, case reports, meta-analyses, letters to the editor, reviews, systematic reviews, practice guidelines, and editorials. RESULTS: We identified 44645 articles over the 19 year-period. There were 8687 pediatric-tagged articles vs 19750 adult-tagged articles. Thus 16208 articles were unaccounted and not assigned a "pediatric" or "adult" tag by PubMed. There was an approximately 3-fold significant increase in all articles recorded both in pediatric and adult articles. This significant increase was true for nearly every category of article but the number of clinical trials, meta-analysis, and randomized controlled trials increased proportionally more than the number of "lower quality" articles such as editorials or letters to the editor. Very few guidelines were published every year. CONCLUSION: There is a yearly linear increase in publications related to IBD. Relatively, there are more and more clinical trials and higher quality articles.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The colonic mucus layer plays a critical role in intestinal homeostasis by limiting contact between luminal bacteria and the mucosal immune system. A defective mucus barrier in animal models allows bacterial contact with the intestinal epithelium and results in spontaneous colitis. A defective mucus barrier is also a key feature of active ulcerative colitis (UC). Alterations in the immune compartment due to intestinal bacterial breach in mice lacking the colon mucus barrier have not been characterized and correlated to active UC. AIMS: To characterize alterations in the immune compartment due to intestinal bacterial breach in Muc2-/- mice, which lack the colon mucus barrier, and correlate the findings to active UC. METHODS: Bacterial contact with colon epithelium and penetration into colon tissue was examined in Muc2-/- mice and colon biopsies from patients with active UC using fluorescence microscopy and qPCR. Neutrophils, lymphocytes, CD103+ dendritic cell subsets and macrophages in colon from Muc2-/- mice and biopsies from UC patients were quantitated by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Inflamed UC patients and Muc2-/- mice had bacteria in contact with the colon epithelium. Bacterial rRNA was present in colonic mucosa in humans and Muc2-/- mice and in the draining lymph nodes of mice. Inflamed Muc2-/- mice and UC patients had elevated colon neutrophils, T cells and macrophages while a reduced frequency of CD103+ DCs was present in the inflamed colon of both mice and humans. CONCLUSIONS: The parallel features of the colon immune cell compartment in Muc2-/- mice and UC patients supports the usefulness of this model to understand the early phase of spontaneous colitis and will provide insight into novel strategies to treat UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) frequently manifests during childhood and adolescence. For providing and understanding a comprehensive picture of a patients' health status, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instruments are an essential complement to clinical symptoms and functional limitations. Currently, the IMPACT-III questionnaire is one of the most frequently used disease-specific HRQoL instrument among patients with IBD. However, there is a lack of studies examining the validation and reliability of this instrument. METHODS: 146 paediatric IBD patients from the multicenter Swiss IBD paediatric cohort study database were included in the study. Medical and laboratory data were extracted from the hospital records. HRQoL data were assessed by means of standardized questionnaires filled out by the patients in a face-to-face interview. RESULTS: The original six IMPACT-III domain scales could not be replicated in the current sample. A principal component analysis with the extraction of four factor scores revealed the most robust solution. The four factors indicated good internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha=.64-.86), good concurrent validity measured by correlations with the generic KIDSCREEN-27 scales and excellent discriminant validity for the dimension of physical functioning measured by HRQoL differences for active and inactive severity groups (p<.001, d=1.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study with Swiss children with IBD indicates good validity and reliability for the IMPACT-III questionnaire. However, our findings suggest a slightly different factor structure than originally proposed. The IMPACT-III questionnaire can be recommended for its use in clinical practice. The factor structure should be further examined in other samples.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is direct evidence that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves the gastrointestinal microbiota and some evidence that the microbiota might also play a similar role in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of this article is to review the emerging evidence for the mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is strongly influenced by factors including age, diet and disease. Probiotics may be effective through their impact on the host gastrointestinal microbiota and promotion of mucosal immunoregulation. Probiotics are considered to be well tolerated, although the quality of studies and health claims has been variable. There are many short-term studies demonstrating the effectiveness of probiotics in IBS, although recommendations should be made for specific strains and for specific symptoms. Within IBD, a number of trials have shown the benefits of a range of probiotics in pouchitis and in ulcerative colitis, although current evidence in Crohn's disease is less promising. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics have considerable potential in the management of IBS and IBD; however, the benefits are strain specific. High-quality trials of probiotics in gastrointestinal disorders as well as laboratory investigations of their mechanism of action are required in order to understand who responds and why.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Limited studies have examined the intestinal microbiota composition in relation to changes in disease course of IBD over time. We aimed to study prospectively the fecal microbiota in IBD patients developing an exacerbation during follow-up. DESIGN: Fecal samples from 10 Crohn's disease (CD) and 9 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients during remission and subsequent exacerbation were included. Active disease was determined by colonoscopy and/or fecal calprotectine levels. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, antibiotic use, enema use and/or medication changes between consecutive samples. The microbial composition was assessed by 16S rDNA pyrosequencing. RESULTS: After quality control, 6,194-11,030 sequences per sample were available for analysis. Patient-specific shifts in bacterial composition and diversity were observed during exacerbation compared to remission, but overarching shifts within UC or CD were not observed. Changes in the bacterial community composition between remission and exacerbation as assessed by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, were significantly larger in CD versus UC patients (0.59 vs. 0.42, respectively; p = 0.025). Thiopurine use was found to be a significant cause of clustering as shown by Principal Coordinate Analysis and was associated with decreases in bacterial richness (Choa1 501.2 vs. 847.6 in non-users; p<0.001) and diversity (Shannon index: 5.13 vs. 6.78, respectively; p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Shifts in microbial composition in IBD patients with changing disease activity over time seem to be patient-specific, and are more pronounced in CD than in UC patients. Furthermore, thiopurine use was found to be associated with the microbial composition and diversity, and should be considered when studying the intestinal microbiota in relation to disease course.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of high- and low-dose oral, delayed-release mesalamine in a randomized, double-blind, active control study of children with mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Patients ages 5 to 17 years, with a Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) score of >/= 10 to </= 55 and a truncated Mayo Score of >/= 1 for both rectal bleeding and stool frequency, were enrolled. They received body weight-dependent doses of oral, delayed-release mesalamine for 6 weeks in a low- (27-71 mg . g(-1) . day(-1)) or high-dose group (53-118 mg . g(-1) . day(-1)). The primary endpoint was treatment success, defined as the proportion of patients who achieved remission (PUCAI score <10) or partial response (PUCAI score >/= 10 with a decrease from baseline by >/= 20 points). Secondary endpoints included truncated Mayo Score and global assessment of change of disease activity. RESULTS: The modified intent-to-treat population included 81 of 83 patients enrolled. Treatment success by PUCAI was achieved by 23 of 41 (56%) and 22 of 40 (55%) patients in the mesalamine low- and high-dose groups, respectively (P = 0.924). Truncated Mayo Score (low-dose 30 [73%] and high-dose 28 [70%] patients) and other efficacy results did not differ between the groups. The type and severity of adverse events were consistent with those reported in previous studies of adults with ulcerative colitis and did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both low- and high-dose oral, delayed-release mesalamine doses were equally effective as short-term treatment of mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis in children, without a specific benefit or risk to using either dose.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD), is commonly associated with poor skeletal health, related to the direct effects of chronic inflammation, prolonged use of glucocorticoid (GC), poor nutrition, delayed puberty and low muscle mass. Low bone mineral density is commonly reported, although the prevalence of long bone fractures may not be increased in these patients. Emerging evidence however suggests that there may be an increased risk of vertebral fractures (VFs) in this group. VFs presenting at diagnosis of paediatric CD, prior to any GC exposure, have been reported, highlighting the deleterious effect of inflammation on skeletal health. This paper reviews the published literature on pathophysiology of skeletal morbidity and fractures in paediatric IBD, illustrated with a new case report of multiple VFs in a prepubertal girl with CD, soon after diagnosis, who received minimal amounts of oral GC. Optimising control of disease, addressing vitamin D deficiency, encouraging physical activity and ensuring normal growth and pubertal progression are paramount to management of bone health in these patients. Despite the lack of evidence, there may be a place for bisphosphonate treatment, especially in the presence of symptomatic pathological fractures, but this requires close monitoring by clinicians with expertise in paediatric bone health. CONCLUSION: Chronic inflammation mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines may have adverse effects on skeletal health in paediatric patients with IBD. The risk of vertebral fractures may be increased, even without exposure to glucocorticoid. Clinical monitoring of these patients requires careful attention to the various factors that impact on bone health.},

   abstract = {The peptide transporter PEPT1, expressed in the brush border membrane of enterocytes, mediates the uptake of di- and tripeptides from luminal protein digestion in the small intestine. PEPT1 was proposed not to be expressed in normal colonic mucosa but may become detectable in inflammatory states such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. We reassessed colonic expression of PEPT1 by performing a systematic analysis of PEPT1 mRNA and protein levels in healthy colonic tissues in mice, rats, and humans. Immunofluorescence analysis of different mouse strains (C57BL/6N, 129/Sv, BALB/c) demonstrated the presence of PEPT1 in the distal part of the colon but not in proximal colon. Rat and human intestines display a similar distribution of PEPT1 as found in mice. However, localization in human sigmoid colon revealed immunoreactivity present at low levels in apical membranes but substantial staining in distinct intracellular compartments. Functional activity of PEPT1 in colonic tissues from mice was assessed in everted sac preparations using [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar and found to be 5.7-fold higher in distal compared with proximal colon. In intestinal tissues from Pept1-/- mice, no [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar transport was detectable but feces samples revealed significantly higher water content than in wild-type mice, suggesting that PEPT1 contributes to colonic water absorption. In conclusion, our studies unequivocally demonstrate the presence of PEPT1 protein in healthy distal colonic epithelium in mice, rats, and humans and proved that the protein is functional and contributes to electrolyte and water handling in mice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: PEPT1 was proposed to be expressed only in inflamed colonic tissues in which it could contribute to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development by transporting bacterial peptides, such as muramyl dipeptide (MDP), that activate intracellular pattern recognition receptors, such as the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain 2. To better define the pathological relevance of this transporter, we analyzed PEPT1 expression during intestinal inflammation and studied the susceptibility of Pept1-deficient (Pept1) mice to experimental colitis. METHODS: Wild-type and Pept1 mice were treated with dextran sulfate sodium and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid to induce colitis, and MDP-induced cytokine expression was studied in colonic tissue cultures. PEPT1 expression was characterized in mouse models of Crohn's disease-like ileitis (Tnf) or colitis (Il-10, Il-10XTlr2) and endoscopic tissue samples from descending colon of patients with IBD (n = 11) and controls (n = 17). Moreover, the prevalence of the PEPT1 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2297322 was tested in German patients with IBD (n = 458) and controls (n = 452). RESULTS: PEPT1 expression was consistently reduced under condition of acute or chronic experimental inflammation. Wild-type and Pept1 mice revealed comparable susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium-induced and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis, and MDP-induced cytokine expression was PEPT1-independent. PEPT1 expression levels were also decreased in descending colon of patients with IBD during acute inflammation, but the rs2297322 single-nucleotide polymorphism was not associated with IBD susceptibility in the German cohort. CONCLUSIONS: PEPT1 expression is reduced during intestinal inflammation and PEPT1 is neither required for MDP-induced immune response nor is the PEPT1 rs2297322 single-nucleotide polymorphism associated with IBD susceptibility in our German cohort. These data strongly argue against a primary role of PEPT1 in the initiation or progression of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: We previously identified an anti-inflammatory compound, zonarol, a hydroquinone isolated from the brown algae Dictyopteris undulata as a marine natural product. To ascertain the in vivo functions of zonarol, we examined the pharmacological effects of zonarol administration on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced inflammation in a mouse model of ulcerative colitis (UC). Our goal is to establish a safe and effective cure for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using zonarol. METHODS AND RESULTS: We subjected Slc:ICR mice to the administration of 2% DSS in drinking water for 14 days. At the same time, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) at a dose of 50 mg/kg (positive control) and zonarol at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg, were given orally once a day. DSS-treated animals developed symptoms similar to those of human UC, such as severe bloody diarrhea, which were evaluated by the disease activity index (DAI). Treatment with 20 mg/kg of zonarol, as well as 5-ASA, significantly suppressed the DAI score, and also led to a reduced colonic ulcer length and/or mucosal inflammatory infiltration by various immune cells, especially macrophages. Zonarol treatment significantly reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules, and prevented the apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. Finally, zonarol protected against in vitro lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation in the RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cell line. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that a marine bioproduct protects against experimental UC via the inhibition of both inflammation and apoptosis, very similar to the standard-of-care sulfasalazine, a well-known prodrug that releases 5-ASA. We believe that the oral administration of zonarol might offer a better treatment for human IBDs than 5-ASA, or may be useful as an alternative/additive therapeutic strategy against UC, without any evidence of side effects.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet is known to have a major role in the expression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The role of dietary interventions and enteral nutrition in the management of IBD remains unelucidated. This study was to review the current evidence for dietary risk factors for the development of IBD and the efficacies of dietary and enteral interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: High dietary intakes of total fats, polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat are associated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Further prospective studies are required to confirm these observations. Among various dietary interventions, none has shown striking efficacy. Meta-analyses have shown enteral nutrition to be inferior to corticosteroids in adults with active Crohn's disease. However, in children, a meta-analysis has shown no significant difference in the remission rates between enteral nutrition and corticosteroid therapy. Although the evidence level is not striking, enteral nutrition may be useful for maintaining remission in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease. SUMMARY: Dietary risk factors for IBD and the therapeutic benefit of dietary and enteral interventions need to be confirmed by further well designed studies in large cohorts of patients.},

   abstract = {Interleukin 15 (IL-15) is a Th1-related cytokine that triggers inflammatory cell recruitment with implications for pathogenesis in ulcerative colitis. The IL-15 gene is located within a 35 kb region of the q28-31 locus of chromosome 4. In the present work, the role of IL-15 gene polymorphisms as susceptibility markers for UC was evaluated. Seven polymorphisms of IL-15 (rs3806798, rs10833, rs4956403, rs2254514, rs2857261, rs10519613, and rs1057972) were genotyped by 5' exonuclease TaqMan genotyping assays in a group of 199 Mexican patients with UC and 698 Mexican Mestizo healthy unrelated individuals. UC patients and healthy controls showed similar distribution of the rs3806798, rs10833, rs4956403, rs2857261, rs10519613, and rs1057972 polymorphisms. The rs2254514 polymorphism was significantly associated with decreased risk of UC as compared to controls under both dominant and additive models (OR 0.62, Pdom = 0.014 and OR 0.65, Padd = 0.02). The rs2254514 CC genotype was associated with young age at diagnosis <40 years (P = 0.03; OR 3.67). Five polymorphisms (rs1051613, rs2254514, rs2857261, rs1057972, and rs10833) were in strong linkage disequilibrium and were included in six haplotypes: H1 (ACAAC), H2 (CCGTC), H3 (CTAAT), H4 (CCAAT), H5 (CTAAC), and H6 (CCAAC). UC patients showed an increased frequency of the H6 haplotype (P = 0.005; OR 3.2) and a decreased frequency of the H5 haplotype (P = 0.031; OR 0.40). These results suggest that the IL-15 rs2254514 polymorphism might have an important role in the development of UC in the Mexican population. We were able to distinguish one risk and one protective uncommon haplotype for the development of UC.},

The interleukin 20 gene is located within a 200kb region of q31-32 locus of chromosome 1. No previous studies have reported this novel association between ulcerative colitis (UC) and IL-20 polymorphisms. In the present work, we evaluated the role of IL-20 gene polymorphisms as susceptibility markers for UC. Three polymorphisms of IL-20 gene (rs2981573, rs2232360, rs1518108) were genotyped by 5' exonuclease TaqMan genotyping assays on an ABI Prism 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR system in a group of 198 Mexican Mestizo patients with UC and 698 ethnically matched healthy unrelated individuals with no family history of UC. We found significant decreased frequencies of two IL-20 genotypes: GG (rs2981573) [10.6% vs. 17.6%, p=0.017, OR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.33-0.93] and GG (rs2232360) [10.6% vs. 17.6%, p=0.017, OR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.33-0.93] in UC patients as compared to healthy controls. No significant differences of gene frequencies were found between UC patients and healthy controls in the rs1518108 polymorphism. In the subgroup analysis, no differences were found between the IL-20 genotypes and the clinical characteristics of UC. The results suggest that the GG genotypes of the IL-20 polymorphisms (rs2981573 and rs2232360) might have an important role in the development of UC in the Mexican population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: PPARs play an important role in the regulation of intestinal inflammation. METHODS: We included a total of 46 UC patients and 31 controls. The gene expression of PPARs was measured by RT-PCR and protein expression by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: PPARalpha gene expression was significantly decreased in patients with active UC compared with remission UC group (P = 0.001) and controls (P = 0.001). We found that low gene expression of PPARalpha in mucosa confers a higher risk of UC activity (P </= 0.0001, OR = 22.6). We observed an increase of PPARalpha expression in patients with UC who were treated with 5-aminosalicylates compared with those who received any other combined therapy (P = 0.03, OR = 0.08). PPARgamma gene expression was decreased in the active UC group compared with UC in remission (P = 0.001) and control group (P = 0.001). An increased expression of PPARgamma gene was associated with mild clinical course of the disease (P </= 0.001, OR = 0.05). No gene expression of PPARbeta/delta was found in the colonic mucosa from UC patients and controls. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that patients with high gene expression of PPARs have a better response to medical treatment and a mild clinical course of the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is controversy about whether levels of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and antidrug antibodies (ADAs) are accurate determinants of loss of response to therapy. We analyzed the association between trough levels of anti-TNF agents or ADAs and outcomes of interventions for patients with loss of response to infliximab or adalimumab. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of pediatric and adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease and suspected loss of response to anti-TNF agents treated at medical centers throughout Israel from October 2009 through February 2013. We examined the correlation between outcomes of different interventions and trough levels of drug or ADAs during loss of response. An additional subanalysis was performed including only patients with a definite inflammatory loss of response (clinical worsening associated with increased levels of C-reactive protein or fecal calprotectin, or detection of inflammation by endoscopy, fistula discharge, or imaging studies). RESULTS: Among 247 patients (42 with ulcerative colitis), there were 330 loss-of-response events (188 to infliximab and 142 to adalimumab). Trough levels of adalimumab greater than 4.5 mcg/mL and infliximab greater than 3.8 mcg/mL identified patients who failed to respond to an increase in drug dosage or a switch to another anti-TNF agent with 90% specificity; these were set as adequate trough levels. Adequate trough levels identified patients who responded to expectant management or out-of-class interventions with more than 75% specificity. Levels of antibodies against adalimumab >4 microgram per mL equivalent (mcg/mL-eq) or antibodies against infliximab >9 mcg/mL-eq identified patients who did not respond to an increased drug dosage with 90% specificity. Patients with high titers of ADAs had longer durations of response when anti-TNF agents were switched than when dosage was increased (P = .03; log-rank test), although dosage increases were more effective for patients with no or low titers of ADAs (P = .02). An analysis of definite inflammatory loss-of-response events (n = 244) produced similar results; patients with adequate trough levels had a longer duration of response when they switched to a different class of agent than when anti-TNF was optimized by either a dosage increase or by a switch within the anti-TNF class (P = .002; log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective analysis suggest that trough levels of drug or ADAs may guide therapeutic decisions for more than two-thirds of inflammatory bowel disease patients with either clinically suspected or definite inflammatory loss of response to therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The level of fecal calprotectin (FC) can predict the onset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with high accuracy and precision. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of using measurements of FC to identify adults and children who require endoscopic confirmation of IBD. METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic tree to compare the cost-effectiveness of measuring FC before endoscopy examination with that of direct endoscopic evaluation alone. A second decision analytic tree was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of FC cutoff levels of 100 mug/g vs 50 mug/g (typically used to screen for intestinal inflammation). The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost required to avoid 1 false-negative result by using FC level to diagnose new-onset IBD. RESULTS: In adults, FC screening saved $417/patient but delayed diagnosis for 2.2/32 patients with IBD among 100 screened patients. In children, FC screening saved $300/patient but delayed diagnosis for 4.8/61 patients with IBD among 100 screened patients. If endoscopic biopsy analysis remained the standard for diagnosis, direct endoscopic evaluation would cost an additional $18,955 in adults and $6250 in children to avoid 1 false-negative result from FC screening. Sensitivity analyses showed that cost-effectiveness of FC screening varied with the sensitivity of the test and the pre-test probability of IBD in adults and children. Pre-test probabilities for IBD of </=75% in adults and </=65% in children made FC screening cost-effective, but it was cost-ineffective if the probabilities were >/=85% and >/=78% in adults and children, respectively. Compared with the FC cutoff level of 100 mug/g, the cutoff level of 50 mug/g cost an additional $55 and $43 for adults and children, respectively, but it yielded 2.4 and 6.1 additional accurate diagnoses of IBD per 100 screened adults and children, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Screening adults and children to measure fecal levels of calprotectin is effective and cost-effective in identifying those with IBD on a per-case basis when the pre-test probability is </=75% for adults and </=65% for children. The utility of the test is greater for adults than children. Increasing the FC cutoff level to >/=50 mug/g increases diagnostic accuracy without substantially increasing total cost.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Fatigue, weakness and musculoskeletal manifestations are associated with IBD. An impaired nutritional status and a reduced physical activity can contribute to these clinical outcomes, impacting quality of life and increasing disability. This study aims to assess muscle strength and lower limb physical performance in female UC patients, taking into consideration disease activity, body composition and habitual physical activity. METHODS: A case-control study was performed including 23 UC female outpatients and 23 age- and BMI-matched healthy women as controls. Quadriceps strength (QS), handgrip strength (HGS), physical performance based measures (five repetitions sit-up test and 4meter gait speed test), body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis, anthropometry), and habitual physical activity (HPA) levels were assessed. RESULTS: UC group had decreased QS (-6%; P=0.012), slower sit-up test (-32%; P=0.000), slower gait speed (-17% P=0.002) and decreased HPA level (-30%, P=0.001) compared with controls. No difference in HGS was observed between groups. Logistic regression showed that UC was an independent factor for decreased QS and slower sit-up test, while HPA was a protective factor for impaired gait speed. Multivariate linear regression showed that BMI was independently associated with an improved QS and slower sit-up test in the UC group. CONCLUSION: Women with UC had decreased lower limb strength and mobility limitations, which were associated with BMI and the level of physical activity. Early evaluation of nutritional status and performance of the lower limbs could identify UC patients with pre-clinical disability who may benefit from earlier health lifestyle modifications.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cystic Fibrosis (CF), Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and Crohn's Disease (CD) manifest as various, multiple symptoms from malfunctioning and/or damaged gastrointestinal tract, which plague the patients. These symptoms result from the dysfunctional expression products of the specific mutations of the genes, which either manifest upon birth (CF) or later in life in immuno-genetically susceptible individuals as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). They all may potentially lead to malnutrition of the patients. Since only correcting the mutated genes, may cure these diseases permanently, the works on the future safe gene therapies continue vigorously. However, provision of the necessary nutrients to the suffering patients is the requirement for an effective, supportive care at present. In this realm, we have developed a model of the diseased gastrointestinal tract aimed to guide designing and testing various nutritional therapies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is well known that inflammatory bowel diseases induce crypts within the patients' gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, we have bioengineered, a novel, three-dimensional model of the gastrointestinal tract to evaluate the rheology of different types of nutrients. The model was assembled out of the bio-inert polymer tube with openings leading to vials of different shapes and sizes, as the simulation of the gastrointestinal tract altered by the diseases to contain multiple crypts. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed three-dimensional model effectively simulates the structure and functions of the gastrointestinal tract of the patients with mild and severe Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn's Disease, and Cystic Fibrosis. This model should allow us to design and test different nutritional supplements, with properties complementing the pathologically altered by the diseases functionalities of the patients' gastrointestinal tracts. Therefore, it should help us to design the effective supportive therapies; thus to prevent the patients' malnutrition.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence supports an immunologic role for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here we examined if pretreatment vitamin D status influences durability of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: All IBD patients who had plasma 25(OH)D level checked <3 months prior to initiating anti-TNF-alpha therapy were included in this retrospective single-center cohort study. Our main predictor variable was insufficient plasma 25(OH)D (<30 ng/mL). Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for potential confounders was used to identify the independent effect of pretreatment vitamin D on biologic treatment cessation. RESULTS: Our study included 101 IBD patients (74 CD; median disease duration 9 years). The median index 25(OH)D level was 27 ng/mL (interquartile range, 20-33 ng/mL). One-third of the patients had prior exposure to anti-TNF-alpha therapy. On multivariate analysis, patients with insufficient vitamin D demonstrated earlier cessation of anti-TNF-alpha therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-4.39; P = .04). This effect was significant in patients who stopped treatment for loss of response (HR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.34-9.09) and stronger for CD (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 0.95-5.99) than UC (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that vitamin D levels may influence durability of anti-TNF-alpha induction and maintenance therapy. Larger cohort studies and clinical trials of supplemental vitamin D use with disease activity as an end point may be warranted.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Despite a paucity of published supporting data, 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) use in pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) is common. The present study describes the use and outcome of a large multicenter inception cohort of children with UC treated with 5-ASA. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Collaborative Research Group Registry, a prospective North American observational study of children newly diagnosed as having inflammatory bowel disease ages 16 years or younger. Patient data are recorded at diagnosis, 30 days, and then quarterly. Patients are managed by physician dictate, not protocol. Disease activity is classified by physician global assessment. The primary outcome examined was corticosteroid (CS) free, inactive UC at 1 year following initiation of 5-ASA within 30 days of diagnosis (with or without concomitant CS use) without the need for rescue therapy (immunomodulators, biologics, or colectomy). RESULTS: Study subjects included 213 patients newly diagnosed as having UC who received oral 5-ASA compounds (115 of whom also received CS) during the first 30 days after diagnosis, and no other oral therapies for the treatment of UC. Of these 213 patients, 86 (40%) were CS free and physician global assessment inactive at 1 year without rescue. Outcome was not associated with disease severity at diagnosis, demographic or laboratory factors examined, or initial dose of 5-ASA used. CONCLUSIONS: Forty percent of children taking 5-ASA as primary maintenance therapy at diagnosis are in CS-free remission after 1 year of treatment. Further pediatric studies will be needed to address whether increased adherence and/or higher dosing schedules will improve outcomes.},
