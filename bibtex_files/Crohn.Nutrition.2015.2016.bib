   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of infliximab (IFX) on surgical outcomes is poorly defined in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). We evaluated our institution's experience with IFX on postoperative complications and surgical recurrence. METHODS: A retrospective review of children who underwent intestinal resection with primary anastomosis for CD from 1/2002 to 10/2014 was performed. Data collected included IFX use and surgical outcomes. Preoperative IFX use was within 3months of surgery. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were included with median age 15years (range: 9-18). The most frequent indications for operation were obstruction (n=26) and fistulae (n=19). Nine patients (13%) had a surgical recurrence at a median of 2.3years (IQR 0.7-3.5). Twenty-two patients received preoperative IFX at median of 26days (IQR 14-46). There were 7 postoperative complications: 2 bowel obstructions, and 5 superficial wound infections. Outcomes of patients stratified by IFX were not different. When stratified by indication, refractory disease was associated with higher preoperative IFX use (IFX use 55% vs. no IFX use 28%, p=0.027). No specific indication was associated with increased reoperation rates. CONCLUSION: Pediatric CD patients treated with preoperative IFX undergo intestinal resection with primary anastomosis with acceptable morbidity. The heterogeneous approach to medical management underscores the need for guidelines to direct treatment.},

   abstract = {We aim to review the literature and provide guidance on preventive health measures in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Structured searches were performed in PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from January 1976 to June 2016 using the following keywords: (inflammatory bowel disease OR Crohn's disease OR ulcerative colitis) AND (health maintenance OR preventive health OR health promotion). Abstracts of the articles selected from each of these multiple searches were reviewed, and those meeting the inclusion criteria (that is, providing data regarding preventive health or health maintenance in IBD patients) were recorded. Reference lists from the selected articles were manually reviewed to identify further relevant studies. Patients with IBD are at increased risk of developing adverse events related to the disease course, therapeutic interventions, or non-adherence to medication. Recent studies have suggested that IBD patients do not receive preventive services with the same thoroughness as patients with other chronic diseases. Preventive health measures can avert morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients with IBD. Gastroenterologists and primary care physicians (PCPs) should have an up to date working knowledge of preventive health measures for IBD patients. A holistic approach and better communication between gastroenterologists and PCPs with explicit clarification of roles will prevent duplication of services and streamline care.},

   abstract = {Recent advances have shown that the abnormal inflammatory response observed in CD involves an interplay among intestinal microbiota, host genetics and environmental factors. The escalating consumption of fat and sugar in Western countries parallels an increased incidence of CD during the latter 20(th) century. The impact of a HF/HS diet in mice was evaluated for the gut micro-inflammation, intestinal microbiota composition, function and selection of an E. coli population. The HF/HS diet created a specific inflammatory environment in the gut, correlated with intestinal mucosa dysbiosis characterized by an overgrowth of pro-inflammatory Proteobacteria such as E. coli, a decrease in protective bacteria, and a significantly decreased of SCFA concentrations. The expression of GPR43, a SCFA receptor was reduced in mice treated with a HF/HS diet and reduced in CD patients compared with controls. Interestingly, mice treated with an agonist of GPR43 were protected against DSS-induced colitis. Finally, the transplantation of feces from HF/HS treated mice to GF mice increased susceptibility to AIEC infection. Together, our results demonstrate that a Western diet could aggravate the inflammatory process and that the activation of the GPR43 receptor pathway could be used as a new strategy to treat CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) are both chronic granulomatous conditions with similar phenotypic presentations. Hence, there is need for a biomarker to differentiate between both these two diseases. This study aimed at genome-wide gene expression analysis of colonic biopsies from confirmed cases of ITB and CD in comparison with controls. To evaluate the role of T regulatory cells, forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) mRNA expression was quantified in serum as well as in colonic biopsies from patients with ITB and with the controls. METHODS: Paired samples, including serum and colonic biopsies, were taken from 33 study subjects (CD, ITB and controls), and total RNA was extracted. Human whole genome gene expression microarray analysis was performed using the Illumina HumanWG-6 BeadChip Kit with six total RNA samples of the three groups in duplicates. Real-time PCR for FOXP3 mRNA expression was analyzed in serum samples and colonic biopsy samples (4-CD, 5-ITB, 4-controls). RESULTS: In CD and ITB there was 1.5-fold upregulation of 92 and 382 genes and 1.5-fold downregulation of 91 and 256 genes, respectively. Peroxisome proliferators via the PPARgamma pathway were most significantly downregulated (P < 0.005) in CD. Additionally, the IL4/5/6 signaling pathways and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway were identified as significantly differentially regulated (P < 0.005) at > 2-fold change. In ITB, the complement activation pathway, specifically the classical pathway, was the most significantly upregulated. FOXP3 mRNA expression was significantly elevated in colonic biopsies obtained from ITB patients as compared with CD cases (4.70 +/- 2.21 vs 1.48 +/- 0.31, P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: FOXP3 mRNA expression in colonic mucosa could be a discriminatory marker between ITB and CD. Upregulation of the complement activation pathway in ITB suggests that pathogenetic mechanisms for ITB are similar to those of pulmonary tuberculosis. In CD, downregulation of PPARgamma was seen in colonic tissue, suggesting that restoration of PPARgamma-dependent anti-microbial barrier function may be a therapeutic target.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing condition of the alimentary tract with a high morbidity secondary to bowel inflammation. Glutamine plays a key role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosa and has been shown to reduce inflammation and disease activity in experimental models of Crohn's disease. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of glutamine supplementation for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases from inception to November 15, 2015: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialised Register. Study references were also searched for additional trials. There were no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared glutamine supplementation administered by any route to a placebo, active comparator or no intervention in people with active Crohn's disease were considered for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess methodological quality. The primary outcome measure was clinical or endoscopic remission. Secondary outcomes included intestinal permeability, clinical response, quality of life, growth in children and adverse events. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS: Two small RCTs (total 42 patients) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. One study (18 patients) compared four weeks of treatment with a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet (42% amino acid composition) to a standard polymeric diet (4% amino acid composition) with low glutamine content in paediatric patients (< 18 years of age) with active Crohn's disease. The other study (24 patients) compared glutamine-supplemented total parenteral nutrition to non-supplemented total parenteral nutrition in adult patients (> 18 years of age) with acute exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. The paediatric study was rated as low risk of bias. The study in adult patients was rated as unclear risk of bias for blinding and low risk of bias for all other items. It was not possible to pool data for meta-analysis because of significant differences in study populations, nature of interventions, and the way outcomes were assessed. Data from one study showed no statistically significant difference in clinical remission rates at four weeks. Forty-four per cent (4/9) of patients who received a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet achieved remission compared to 56% (5/9) of patients who received a standard low-glutamine polymeric diet (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.04). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence for this outcome was low due to serious imprecision (9 events). In both included studies, no statistically significant changes in intestinal permeability were found between patients who received glutamine supplementation and those who did not. Neither study reported on clinical response, quality of life or growth in children. Adverse event data were not well documented. There were no serious adverse events in the paediatric study. The study in adult patients reported three central catheter infections with positive blood cultures in the glutamine group compared to none in the control group (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.40 to 122.44). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently there is insufficient evidence to allow firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of glutamine for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Data from two small studies suggest that glutamine supplementation may not be beneficial in active Crohn's disease but these results need to be interpreted with caution as they are based on small numbers of patients. This review highlights the need for adequately powered randomised controlled trials to investigate the efficacy and safety of glutamine for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {AIM: To critically review and summarize the literature on nutritional and health outcomes of semi-elemental formulations on various nutritionally vulnerable patient populations who are unable to achieve adequate nutrition from standard oral diets. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search of Pubmed and Embase databases. We manually screened articles that examined nutritional and health outcomes (e.g., growth, disease activity, gastrointestinal impairment, mortality, and economic impact) among various patient groups receiving semi-elemental diets. This review focused on full-text articles of randomized controlled clinical trials and other intervention studies, but pertinent abstracts and case studies were also included. Results pertaining primarily to tolerance, digestion, and absorption were summarized for each patient population in this systematic review. RESULTS: Results pertaining primarily to tolerance, digestion, and absorption were summarized for each patient population. The efficacy of semi-elemental whey hydrolyzed protein (WHP) diet have been reported in various nutritionally high risk patient populations including - Crohn's disease, short bowel syndrome, acute and chronic pancreatitis, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, cerebrovascular accidents, human immunodeficiency virus, critically ill, and geriatrics. Collectively, the evidence from the medical literature indicates that feeding with a semi-elemental diet performs as well or better than parenteral or amino acid based diets in terms of tolerance, digestion, and nutrient assimilation measures across various disease conditions. CONCLUSION: Based on this comprehensive review of the literature, patient populations who have difficulty digesting or absorbing standard diets may be able to achieve improved health and nutritional outcomes through the use of semi-elemental WHP diets.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) therapy using a polymeric formula (PF) can substantially attenuate intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. However, the mechanism(s) by which EEN suppresses inflammation are not yet fully understood. The aims were to examine cellular mechanism(s) through which EEN may suppress inflammation and investigate potential pathways to enhance anti-inflammatory properties of EEN. METHODS: Glutamine, arginine, vitamin D3, and alpha linolenic acid (ALA), present in PF, along with curcumin, were identified as immunoactive nutrient therapies. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-exposed HT-29 colonic epithelial cells were used to investigate the immunosuppressive activity of the nutrients by assessing their effect on cell viability, cell activity, chemokine response (interleukin-8 [IL-8]), nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, IkappaB kinase (Ikappakappa), and nitric oxide (NO). RESULTS: Cellular viability and activity were maintained with all nutrient treatments. Glutamine, arginine, and vitamin D3, but not ALA, significantly attenuated IL-8 production. Glutamine and arginine led to phosphorylation blockade of the signaling components in NF-kappaB and P38 pathways, reduction in kinase activity, and enhancement in NO production. Combining glutamine, arginine, and curcumin at optimal concentrations completely abolished the IL-8 response. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that glutamine, arginine, and vitamin D3 can suppress inflammation at concentrations equivalent to those used in PF. The mechanisms of this action were mediated through influencing the NF-kappaB and P38 cascades. Glutamine and arginine-fortified PF with curcumin might be a promising option to enhance the effectiveness and expand the scope of EEN therapy in CD treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional therapy is a viable therapeutic option for the treatment of Crohn disease (CD). Therefore improving nutritional therapy would greatly benefit CD patients. The aim of this study was to define the anti-inflammatory properties of a novel nutritional polymeric formula (PF) in comparison to a currently available standard PF. METHODS: Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was utilized to induce colitis in C57BL/6 mice with mice randomized to receive either standard PF or novel PF in addition to control groups. Changes in body weight were recorded and colonic damage was assessed histologically and biochemically. Additional experiments were also included where the cytokine response of colonic biopsies from pediatric CD patients was measured following exposure to standard PF or novel PF. RESULTS: DSS induced significant body weight loss, morphological changes in the colon, increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and up-regulated colonic mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, as well as associated histological changes. Other than histological damage, these inflammatory changes were reversed by both novel and standard PF. However, the novel PF, but not standard PF, completely suppressed TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8 levels from cultured biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Newly developed nutritional formula reproducibly ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in a murine model, although this response was not measurably different to standard PF. However, the novel PF was significantly superior in suppressing inflammatory cytokine release from cultured colonic biopsies. Collectively, these findings support a possible role for novel PF in advancing nutritional therapy for CD patients.},

   abstract = {N-Palmitoylethanolamine or palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an anti-inflammatory compound that was recently shown to exert peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha-dependent beneficial effects on colon inflammation. The actions of PEA are terminated following hydrolysis by 2 enzymes: fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and the less-studied N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA). This study aims to investigate the effects of inhibiting the enzymes responsible for PEA hydrolysis in colon inflammation in order to propose a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Two murine models of IBD were used to assess the effects of NAAA inhibition, FAAH inhibition, and PEA on macroscopic signs of colon inflammation, macrophage/neutrophil infiltration, and the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the colon, as well as on the colitis-related systemic inflammation. NAAA inhibition increases PEA levels in the colon and reduces colon inflammation and systemic inflammation, similarly to PEA. FAAH inhibition, however, does not increase PEA levels in the colon and does not affect the macroscopic signs of colon inflammation or immune cell infiltration. This is the first report of an anti-inflammatory effect of a systemically administered NAAA inhibitor. Because NAAA is the enzyme responsible for the control of PEA levels in the colon, we put forth this enzyme as a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammation in general and IBD in particular.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis [UC] is associated with colonic mucosa barrier defects and bacterial dysbiosis, but these features may simply be the result of inflammation. Therefore, we sought to assess whether these features are inherently abrogated in the terminal ileum [TI] of UC patients, where inflammation is absent. METHODS: TI biopsies from paediatric inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] subsets [Crohn's disease [CD; n = 13] and UC [n = 10]], and non-IBD disease controls [n = 12] were histologically graded, and alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff stained biopsies were quantified. The mucosal barrier was assessed for mucin [MUC2], immunoglobulin [Ig]A, IgG, and total bacteria (fluorescence in-situ hybridisation [FISH probe EUB338]) by immunofluorescence. The regulation of mucin secretion was investigated by NLRP6 gene expression and immunofluorescence. The composition of the active mucosa-associated microbiota was explored by sequencing the 16S rRNA amplicon generated from total RNA. RESULTS: Despite the absence of ileitis, UC patients displayed ileal barrier depletion illustrated by reductions in mucin-containing goblet cells and mucin production and altered epithelial NLRP6 expression. In both CD patients with ileitis and UC patients with normal histology, bacteria coated with IgA and IgG penetrated the TI mucin layer. Biopsy 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a reduction in alpha-diversity by three methods [Shannon, Simpson, and Equitability indices] between UC and non-IBD paediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an underlying defect in the UC-afflicted intestinal tract even in the absence of inflammation, implicating barrier and microbial changes as primary abnormalities in UC that may play a causative role in disease development.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU) is the rarest IBD subtype with treatment based on extrapolation from ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) studies. We compared IBDU treatment choices with other colonic IBDs and explored long-term outcomes. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective longitudinal study of 23 centers of pediatric IBD with isolated colitis, including a mild ileitis consistent with backwash. RESULTS: Of note, 797 children (median age: 11.6 years, range: 2-18.4) were included: 250 with CD, 287 with UC, and 260 with IBDU (median follow-up: 2.8 [interquartile range: 1.6-4.2] years). IBDU differed from UC with lower corticosteroid (154 [59%] versus 204 [71%]; P = 0.004) and higher exclusive enteral nutrition use (26 [10%] versus 2 [0.6%]; P < 0.0001). Compared to patients with CD, patients with IBDU received less exclusive enteral nutrition and immunomodulators (26 [10%] versus 93 [37%]; P < 0.0001 and 67 [26%] versus 129 [52%]; P < 0.0001, respectively) but more aminosalicylates (228 [88%] versus 159 [64%]; P < 0.0001). Biological treatment was significantly higher in CD (82 [34%]) than in IBDU and UC (24 [12%] and 47 [17%], respectively; P < 0.0001). At last follow-up, 135 (69%) patients with IBDU had remission/mild disease activity compared with 100 (46%; P < 0.0001) patients with CD and 174 (64%; P = 0.3) patients with UC. Four (2%) of 194 patients with IBDU underwent surgery compared with 22 (8%) of 270 patients with UC (P = 0.009) and 20 (8%) of 238 patients with CD (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBDU have a lower medication burden and lower surgery rates than other IBD subtypes. The disease course at follow-up is generally mild, supporting an initial trial with 5-ASA before using more aggressive therapies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to determine the presence of endothelial dysfunction by measuring aortic intima-media thickness (aIMT) and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and to evaluate the role of traditional risk factors for premature atherosclerosis in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Thirty-four children with IBD (25 Crohn disease [CD] and 9 ulcerative colitis [UC]; mean age 11.1 years) and 27 healthy subjects matched for sex and age were enrolled. In all of the patients, demographic characteristics and risk factors for atherosclerosis (age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, dyslipidemia, active and passive smoking, and family history for cardiovascular diseases), CD and UC clinical activity scores, and inflammatory markers were evaluated. aIMT and cIMT were measured by high-resolution B-mode ultrasound. RESULTS: aIMT was significantly higher in patients than in controls (P < 0.0005). No significant differences were found for cIMT, although the carotid thickness was higher in patients with IBD than in healthy subjects. At a univariate analysis, inflammatory markers levels and tobacco smoking exposure were significantly related to higher aIMT values, whereas in a multivariate regression model, the inflammatory status was the only independent variable correlated with high aIMT. CONCLUSIONS: aIMT is an earlier marker of preclinical atherosclerosis than cIMT in young children with active IBD. The inflammatory status and the smoking exposure are significantly correlated with the premature endothelial dysfunction. These data emphasize the importance of controlling the chronic intestinal inflammation and endorsing smoke-free environments for children and adolescents with IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although gastritis and esophagitis are well studied in children, there is very limited literature on duodenitis in children. We aimed to assess the prevalence, etiology, clinical, endoscopic, and pathological features in a large cohort of unselected children with duodenitis. METHODS: We reviewed the pathology reports of all the upper endoscopies performed at our institution during 5 years to identify children with duodenitis. Biopsy sections were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of duodenitis. Demographic, clinical, endoscopic data, and the presence of associated gastritis and esophagitis were noted in all of the children with duodenitis. The etiology of duodenitis was correlated with the patients' clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: Out of 2772 children who had endoscopy, 352 had duodenitis with the prevalence rate of 12.7%. Gastritis was seen in 64% of children with duodenitis compared with 46% of children without duodenitis (P < 0.001). Common indications for endoscopy in children with duodenitis were abdominal pain, positive celiac serology, and diarrhea. The most common etiology was celiac disease (32%), followed by Crohn disease (13%), ulcerative colitis (3%), and Helicobacter pylori infection (6%). In 63% of cases, the endoscopic appearance of duodenum was normal. Cryptitis, villous changes, and cellular infiltration were noted on histology. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of duodenitis is 12.7% in children undergoing endoscopy. Celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease are common causes of duodenitis. Associated gastritis is common in children with duodenitis, and the correlation of endoscopic appearance with histology is poor.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Phase 3 trials have shown the efficacy of vedolizumab, which binds to integrin alpha4beta7, in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). We investigated the effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab in patients who failed anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. METHODS: From June through December 2014, there were 173 patients with CD and 121 patients with UC who were included in a multicenter nominative compassionate early access program granted by French regulatory agencies. This program provided patients with access to vedolizumab before it was authorized for marketing. Vedolizumab (300 mg) was administered intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6, and then every 8 weeks. Disease activity was assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index for CD and the partial Mayo Clinic score for UC. We report results obtained after the 14-week induction phase. RESULTS: Among the 294 patients treated with vedolizumab (mean age, 39.5 +/- 14.0 y; mean disease duration, 10.8 +/- 7.6 y; concomitant steroids, 44% of cases), 276 completed the induction period, however, 18 discontinued vedolizumab because of a lack of response (n = 14), infusion-related reaction (n = 2), or infections (n = 2). At week 14, 31% of patients with CD were in steroid-free clinical remission and 51% had a response; among patients with UC, 36% were in steroid-free clinical remission and 50% had a response. No deaths were reported. Severe adverse events occurred in 24 patients (8.2%), including 15 (5.1%) that led to vedolizumab discontinuation (1 case of pulmonary tuberculosis and 1 rectal adenocarcinoma). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of patients with CD or UC who failed previous anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy, approximately one third of patients achieved steroid-free clinical remission after 14 weeks of induction therapy with vedolizumab. This agent had an acceptable safety profile in these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC); yet, there are few prospective studies of dietary factors. None have examined the association between adolescent diet and risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (CD and UC). METHODS: This study included women enrolled in Nurses' Health Study II who completed a validated high school dietary questionnaire in 1998. We examined the effect of dietary patterns (prudent or Western diet) and individual components of each patterns. We documented incident cases of CD and UC through 2011 based on physician review of medical records and used Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for confounders to estimate hazard ratios and confidence intervals for CD and UC. RESULTS: Over 763,229 person-years of follow-up, we identified 70 incident cases of CD and 103 cases of UC. Compared with women in the lowest quartile of a prudent diet score (characterized by greater intake of fruits, vegetables, and fish), women in the highest quartile had a 53% lower risk of CD (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.98; P trend = 0.04). Specifically, greater intake of fish (P trend = 0.01) and fiber (P trend = 0.06) were associated with lower risk of CD. In contrast, Western diet score was not associated with risk of CD. Neither dietary patterns nor individual food or nutrient groups was associated with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent diet is associated with risk of CD, but not UC, offering insights into disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {We performed a prospective study of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases to examine variations in treatment among medical centers. In a prospective cohort study of 1659 patients with Crohn's disease and 946 patients with ulcerative colitis seen at 7 high-volume referral centers, we collected data on demographics, disease characteristics, and medical and surgical treatments. We used logistic regression to determine differences in treatment among centers, controlling for potential confounders. We found significant variations among centers in the treatment of Crohn's disease with immunomodulators (odds ratio [OR], 3.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09-5.32) but not anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.97-2.77). There was less variation in the treatment of ulcerative colitis; we found no difference in use of immunomodulators (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.00-3.36) or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.40-1.65). The development and implementation of evidence-based standards of care for inflammatory bowel disease may help reduce variation and improve outcomes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Prebiotic inulin-type fructans are widely consumed in the diet and may have contrasting effects in Crohn's disease by stimulating gut microbiota and/or by generating functional gastrointestinal symptoms. The aim of this study was to measure fructan and oligofructose intakes in patients with active and inactive Crohn's disease compared with healthy controls. METHODS: Patients with active Crohn's disease (n = 98), inactive Crohn's (n = 99) and healthy controls (n = 106) were recruited to a case-control study. Dietary intake of inulin-type fructans was measured using a specific food frequency questionnaire and was compared between the three groups and between patients with different disease phenotypes (Montreal classification). Associations between intakes and disease activity (Harvey-Bradshaw Index, HBI) were also undertaken. RESULTS: Patients with active Crohn's disease had lower fructan intakes (median 2.9 g/d, interquartile range [IQR] 1.8) than those with inactive Crohn's (3.6 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.036) or controls (3.9 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.003) and lower oligofructose intakes (2.8 g/d, 1.8) than those with inactive Crohn's (3.5 g/d, 2.2, p = 0.048) or controls (3.8 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.003). There were no differences in intakes related to disease site or behaviour. There were negative correlations between HBI well-being score and fructan intake (rho = -0.154, p = 0.03) and oligofructose intake (rho = -0.156, p = 0.028) and for the HBI abdominal pain score and fructan (rho = -0.164, p = 0.021) and oligofructose intake (rho = -0.157, p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with active Crohn's disease consume lower quantities of fructans and oligofructose than their inactive counterparts and healthy controls. The impact of lower intakes of prebiotic fructans on gut microbiota is unknown and warrants further research.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests a nutritional transition process in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Obesity, which was once an uncommon occurrence in such patients, has grown in this population at the same prevalence rate as that found in the general population, bringing with it an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Objective The aim of the present study was to determine the nutritional status and occurrence of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: A case-series cross-sectional study was conducted involving male and female adult outpatients with inflammatory bowel disease. Data were collected on demographic, socioeconomic, clinical and anthropometric variables as well as the following cardiovascular risk factors: sedentary lifestyle, excess weight, abdominal obesity, medications in use, comorbidities, alcohol intake and smoking habits. The significance level for all statistical tests was set to 5% (P< 0.05). RESULTS: The sample comprised 80 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, 56 of whom (70.0%) had ulcerative colitis and 24 of whom (30.0%) had Crohn's disease. Mean age was 40.3+/-11 years and the female genre accounted for 66.2% of the sample. High frequencies of excess weight (48.8%) and abdominal obesity (52.5%) were identified based on the body mass index and waist circumference, respectively, in both groups, especially among those with ulcerative colitis. Muscle depletion was found in 52.5% of the sample based on arm muscle circumference, with greater depletion among patients with Crohn's disease (P=0.008). The most frequent risk factors for cardiovascular disease were a sedentary lifestyle (83.8%), abdominal obesity (52.5%) and excess weight (48.8%). CONCLUSION: The results of the complete anthropometric evaluation draw one's attention to a nutritional paradox, with high frequencies of both - muscle depletion, as well as excess weight and abdominal obesity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (PIBD) is a chronic condition seen in genetically predisposed individuals. Genome-wide association studies have implicated >160 genomic loci in IBD with many genes coding for proteins in key immune pathways. This study looks at autoimmune disease burden in patients diagnosed with PIBD and interrogates exome data of a subset of patients. METHODS: Patients were recruited from the Southampton Genetics of PIBD cohort. Clinical diagnosis of autoimmune disease in these individuals was ascertained from medical records. For a subset of patients with PIBD and concurrent asthma, exome data was interrogated to ascertain the burden of pathogenic variants within genes implicated in asthma. Association testing was conducted between cases and population controls using the SKAT-O test. RESULTS: Forty-nine (28.3%) PIBD children (18.49% CD, 8.6% UC, and 21.15% IBDU patients) had a concurrent clinical diagnosis of at least one other autoimmune disorder; asthma was the most prevalent, affecting 16.2% of the PIBD cohort. Rare and common variant association testing revealed 6 significant genes (P < 0.05) before Bonferroni adjustment. Three of these genes were previously implicated in both asthma and IBD (ZPBP2 IL1R1, and IL18R1) and 3 in asthma only (PYHIN1, IL2RB, and GSTP1). CONCLUSIONS: One-third of our cohort had a concurrent autoimmune condition. We observed higher incidence of asthma compared with the overall pediatric prevalence. Despite a small sample size, SKAT-O evaluated a significant burden of rare and common mutations in 6 genes. Variant burden suggests that a systemic immune dysregulation rather than organ-specific could underpin immune dysfunction for a subset of patients.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Capsule Endoscopy (CE) in children has limitations based mainly on age. The objective of this consensus was reviewing the scientific evidence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Some experts from the Spanish Society of Gastroenterology (SEPD) and Spanish Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (SEGHNP) were invited to answer different issues about CE in children. These sections were: a) Indications, contraindications and limitations; b) efficacy of CE in different clinical scenarios; c) CE performance; d) CE-related complications; e) Patency Capsule; and f) colon capsule endoscopy. They reviewed relevant questions on each topic. RESULTS: The main indication is Crohn's disease (CD). There is no contraindication for the age and in the event that the patient not to swallow it, it should be administered under deep sedation with endoscopy and specific device. The CE is useful in CD, for the management of OGIB in children and in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (in this indication has the most effectiveness). The main complication is retention, which should be specially taken into account in cases of CD already diagnosed with malnutrition. A preparation regimen based on a low volume of polyethylene glycol (PEG) the day before plus simethicone on the same day is the best one in terms of cleanliness although does not improve the results of the CE procedure. CONCLUSIONS: CE is safe and useful in children. Indications are similar to those of adults, the main one is CD to establish both a diagnosis and disease extension. Moreover, only few limitations are detected in children.},

In this study, we compare histologic features of IBD with STI colitis caused by syphilis and lymphogranuloma venereum. METHODS: The STI colitis group included 10 unique colorectal biopsy specimens in patients with clinically confirmed syphilis and/or lymphogranuloma venereum. The STI biopsy specimens were compared with patients matched for age, sex, and site with Crohn disease (n = 10) or ulcerative colitis (n = 10). All IBD controls had an established history of IBD (up to 276 months of follow-up, mean follow-up = 102 months). RESULTS: Discriminating features (P < .05) of STI colitis included its exclusive identification in human immunodeficiency virus-positive men who have sex with men, anal pain, and anal discharge. STI colitis contained the triad of (1) minimal active chronic crypt centric damage, (2) a lack of mucosal eosinophilia, and (3) submucosal plasma cells, endothelial swelling, and perivascular plasma cells. Nondiscriminating features (P > .05) included rectal bleeding, endoscopic appearance, skip lesions, ulcerations, aphthoid lesions, granulomata, foreign body giant cells, neural hyperplasia, fibrosis, and lymphoid aggregates. CONCLUSIONS: While STI colitis shares many overlapping features with IBD, histologic and clinical discriminating features may be helpful when confronted with that differential diagnosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Paris classification (PC) of paediatric inflammatory bowel disease categorises disease extent and therefore affects treatment decisions. Histological (microscopic) disease extent is not incorporated, and endoscopic (macroscopic) findings may underrepresent disease extent when compared with histological findings; this study compares disease extent at presentation. METHODS: Data were obtained of patients <17 years of age diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease from 2010 to 2013 at University Hospital Southampton. Data are presented as percentage of patients undergoing endoscopy. PC was performed alongside a modified PC by histological disease location. RESULTS: A total of 172 patients were identified (median age at diagnosis 13.5 years, 115 boys); Crohn disease (CD) 107, ulcerative colitis (UC) 50, inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU) 15; 159 had undergone upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, 163 had undergone lower GI endoscopy. Histological disease was more extensive at all points for CD, UC, and IBDU. CD--endoscopic ileal disease in 49% of patients compared with histological disease in 71.3%. Comparing PC--a 10% increase in L3 disease (ileocolonic), a 24% increase in L3 + L4a disease (ileocolonic plus upper GI), and a 27% increase in all of the upper GI involvement if histological disease extent was used. UC--the most common disease location was the rectum (endoscopic 91.5% vs histological 93.6%) and descending colon (endoscopic 89.4% vs histological 95.7%). Comparing PC--a 19% increase in E4 disease (pancolitis) if histological disease extent was used. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that histological disease extent is greater than endoscopic disease extent. This should be considered when the PC is used. Further study is needed to elucidate which classification would better predict disease outcome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Different practice guidelines and consensus statements for both pediatric- and adult-onset inflammatory bowel disease exist. Although variations in medical care among gastroenterologists are common, it is unknown whether there are fundamental differences between disciplines. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate differences in common practices across disciplines. METHODS: This was a prospective, questionnaire-based survey of gastroenterologists attending gastroenterology meetings in Israel. The questionnaire covered attitudes to medical resources, diagnostic and follow-up measures as well as therapeutic approaches. RESULTS: Overall, 120 (60%) of the approached adult gastroenterologists (AGs) and 49 (75%) pediatric gastroenterologists (PGs) completed the questionnaire. The 2 groups differed significantly in various practice areas. Pediatric patients are seen more frequently and for longer appointments. PGs tend to assess thiopurine metabolites (96% vs 47%) more often during treatment. There is a significant variation in practice between groups concerning infectious serology status and vaccinations. Methotrexate in Crohn patients is used more commonly by PGs (55% vs 22%). Long-term combination therapy of thiopurines and anti-tumor necrosis factoralpha agents is used more often by AGs. In patients with ulcerative colitis AGs use oral 5-aminosalicylic acid once daily (51% vs 21%) and add rectal agents from the first day of treatment (72% vs 35%) more often as compared with PGs. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that common practices in inflammatory bowel disease patients differ significantly between adult and pediatric practitioners. These findings call for investigating the reasons for these differences and promoting strategies to diminish these gaps.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and functional abdominal pain (FAP) are associated with debilitating symptoms and frequent medical visits that may disrupt school functioning. The aim of this study was to assess school-related quality of life and school absenteeism in children with IBD, compared with FAP and healthy controls. METHODS: School absenteeism and participation in school and after-school activities data were obtained for 43 children with Crohn disease (CD), 31 children with ulcerative colitis (UC), 42 children with FAP, and 30 age-matched healthy controls for the 2013-2014 school year. We used a semistructured questionnaire for both children and parents. For diminishing recall bias, absenteeism data were cross-matched with the patient's school annual report cards. RESULTS: Children with FAP, CD, and UC missed significantly more school days than age-matched healthy controls (17.6 [8.75-30], 24 [14-30], and 21 [12-25] vs 5.1 [3.75-6.25], respectively, P < 0.001). Compared with children with FAP, absenteeism because of medical appointments and hospitalization was significantly greater in children with CD and UC (8.8 [4-14] and 7.1 [3-10] vs 4.4 [2-6.25], P = 0.001). Participation of children with FAP and IBD in various school and after-school activities was significantly reduced compared with healthy controls. There was no difference in school attendance and functioning between children with IBD and FAP. CONCLUSIONS: FAP has a significant impact on school attendance and functioning similar to IBD. These findings show that significant psychosocial and academic difficulties are faced not only by children with chronic diseases like IBD but also by children with FAP.},

Recently, a LACC1 missense mutation was found in patients suffering from monogenic forms of CD, but also systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We tested the hypothesis that LACC1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in addition to CD, are associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA, non-systemic), and another major form of inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis (UC). We selected 11 LACC1 tagging SNPs, and tested their effect on disease risk in 3855 Swedish individuals from three case-control cohorts of CD, UC and JIA. We detected false discovery rate corrected significant associations with individual markers in all three cohorts, thereby expanding previous results for CD also to UC and JIA. LACC1's link to several inflammatory diseases suggests a key role in the human immune system and justifies further characterization of its function(s).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic variation in the Laccase (multicopper oxidoreductase) domain-containing 1 (LACC1) gene has been shown to affect the risk of Crohn's disease, leprosy and, more recently, ulcerative colitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. LACC1 function appears to promote fatty-acid oxidation, with concomitant inflammasome activation, reactive oxygen species production, and anti-bacterial responses in macrophages. We sought to contribute to elucidating LACC1 biological function by extensive characterization of its expression in human tissues and cells, and through preliminary analyses of the regulatory mechanisms driving such expression. METHODS: We implemented Western blot, quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry analyses to investigate fatty acid metabolism-immune nexus (FAMIN; the LACC1 encoded protein) expression in subcellular compartments, cell lines and relevant human tissues. Gene-set enrichment analyses were performed to initially investigate modulatory mechanisms of LACC1 expression. A small-interference RNA knockdown in vitro model system was used to study the effect of FAMIN depletion on peroxisome function. RESULTS: FAMIN expression was detected in macrophage-differentiated THP-1 cells and several human tissues, being highest in neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells among peripheral blood cells. Subcellular co-localization was exclusively confined to peroxisomes, with some additional positivity for organelle endomembrane structures. LACC1 co-expression signatures were enriched for genes involved in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling pathways, and PPAR ligands downregulated FAMIN expression in in vitro model systems. CONCLUSION: FAMIN is a peroxisome-associated protein with primary role(s) in macrophages and other immune cells, where its metabolic functions may be modulated by PPAR signaling events. However, the precise molecular mechanisms through which FAMIN exerts its biological effects in immune cells remain to be elucidated.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: We sought to investigate the value of neutrophil volume distribution width in detecting inflammatory bowel disease activation. METHODS: Patients with infection and accompanying inflammatory disease were excluded. All the patients were diagnosed and classified according to Porto criteria and Paris classification, respectively. Physician global assessment, pediatric Crohn's disease and pediatric ulcerative colitis activity indexes and fecal calprotectin were used to define disease activation. RESULTS: A total of 34 pediatric patients with Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and 29 controls were enrolled in the study. Neutrophil volume distribution width (NVDW) was significantly higher in patients with IBD compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001). An increased NVDW level was observed in IBD patients in activation (22.42 +/- 2.13) compared to those in remission (19.22 +/- 1.63) (P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between IBD patients in remission and healthy controls. The best cutoff of NVDW for prediction of disease activation in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in this series was 20.39 with a sensitivity of 90.9% and a specificity of 75% (AUC: 0.852 CI: 0.698-1.000 P < 0.001) and 19.74 with a sensitivity of 92.9% and a specificity of 90.9% (AUC: 0.961, CI: 0.889-1.000, P < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: As a quantitative, objective, and sensitive parameter, we believe that the NVDW has a potential to be an additional test detecting disease activation in IBD.},

   abstract = {Diffuse amyloid goiter (AG) is an entity characterized by the deposition of amyloid in the thyroid gland. AG may be associated with either primary or secondary amyloidosis. Secondary amyloidosis is rarely caused by inflammatory bowel diseases. Secondary amyloidosis is relatively more common in the patients with Crohn's disease, whereas it is highly rare in patients with ulcerative colitis. Diffuse amyloid goiter caused by ulcerative colitis is also a rare condition. In the presence of amyloid in the thyroid gland, medullary thyroid cancer should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis. Imaging techniques and biochemical tests are not very helpful in the diagnosis of secondary amyloid goiter and the definitive diagnosis is established based on the histopathologic analysis and histochemical staining techniques. In this report, we present a 35-year-old male patient with diffuse amyloid goiter caused by secondary amyloidosis associated with ulcerative colitis.},

Despite potential benefits in this population, intravenous iron supplementation is often withheld due to concerns regarding pharmacy expense, perceived safety issues, and doubts regarding efficacy in elderly patients. This retrospective, observational cohort study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM, Ferinject) in patients aged >75 years with iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). Within a twelve-month data extraction period, the charts of 405 hospitalised patients aged 65-101 years were retrospectively analysed for IDA, defined according to WHO criteria for anaemia (haemoglobin: <13.0 g/dL (m)/<12.0 g/dL (f)) in conjunction with transferrin saturation <20%. Of 128 IDA patients screened, 51 (39.8%) received intravenous iron. 38 patient charts were analysed. Mean cumulative dose of intravenous FCM was 784.4 +/- 271.7 mg iron (1-3 infusions). 18 patients (47%) fulfilled treatment response criteria (>/=1.0 g/dL increase in haemoglobin between baseline and hospital discharge). AEs were mild/moderate, most commonly transient increases of liver enzymes (n = 5/13.2%). AE incidence was comparable with that observed in patients <75 years. No serious AEs were observed. Ferric carboxymaltose was well tolerated and effective for correction of Hb levels and iron stores in this cohort of IDA patients aged over 75 years.},

METHODS: Fifty-one children with IBD underwent DXA and QUS measurements at hand phalanges in the year 2013. The control group for the QUS consisted of 460 children. Reference data for DXA comes from Hologic Explorer. RESULTS: QUS measurements did not differ significantly between IBD patients and healthy controls. There was no difference between UC and CD subjects. DXA measurements in patients with IBD were lower than in the healthy population. Tanner stage and nutritional status correlated with bone status contrary to steroids therapy. CONCLUSION: Low bone mineral density often complicates IBD in children. QUS is not an appropriate method for the assessment of bone status in children. Nutritional status seems to have a greater impact on bone status than corticosteroids therapy.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two major forms of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Vitamin A (VA) and vitamin D (VD) may be associated with reduction in inflammation in these disorders. The aim of this review was to show the current evidence that may associate VA and VD with IBDs. Data linking VA, VD, and IBDs were studied. Both VA and VD may be related to the immune system in different manners. The active form of VA, retinoic acid, may be related to the growth factor-beta and release of interleukin-10 (IL-10), thus involved with the resolution of the inflammation. Its deficiency is associated with the increase of disease activity. The active form of VD is 1,25(OH)2D3 that produces biological effects via the nuclear hormone receptor named VD receptor (VDR), which may interfere with the immune cells and macrophages leading to the suppression of the inflammatory process by decreasing the release of TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8, IL-12, and IL-23. VDR may also activate nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 expression and stimulate the production of the defensin and cathelicidin that are important to the homeostasis of the mucosal immune barrier. The use of VA and VD could be helpful in the treatment and prevention of IBDs but more studies are necessary to establish the precise role of these compounds in the prevention or remission of these inflammatory processes.},

   abstract = {Adjuvants to the traditional therapy of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been studied to enhance the efficacy of the treatment and improve patients' quality of life. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega3FA) have been associated with attenuation of the inflammatory responses in IBD, possibly acting as substrates for anti-inflammatory eicosanoid production, similar to prostaglandins and leukotrienes. omega3FA also act as substrates for the synthesis of resolvins, maresins and protectins, indispensable in resolving inflammation processes. These acids may influence the development or course of IBD by: reducing oxidative stress, production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and proinflammatory cytokines; working as chemopreventive agents; and decreasing the expression of adhesion molecules. There are numerous controversies in the literature on the effects of omega3FA in the prevention or treatment of IBD, but their effects in reducing inflammation is incontestable. Therefore, more studies are warranted to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms and establish the recommended daily intake to prevent or induce remission in IBD patients.},

Meta-analysis of several randomized controlled trials have confirmed benefit for the administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea and to treat acute infectious diarrhea. Individual studies have also suggested benefit of probiotics to prevent acute gastroenteritis and serve as an adjunct in ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, CDI, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic in breastfed babies. Although promising, larger well-designed studies need to confirm these findings. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental factors are an integral component in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is an increasing interest in nutritive components. While the potential disease-modifying role of coffee has been intensively investigated in a variety of gastrointestinal diseases, the data on the potential impact on IBD is very limited. We aimed to determine the patients' perspective on coffee consumption in IBD. METHODS: We conducted a questionnaire among IBD patients in Switzerland, assessing key questions regarding coffee consumption. Descriptive statistics including chi square testing were used for analysis of questionnaire data. RESULTS: Among a total of 442 patients 73% regularly consume coffee. 96% of patients attributing a positive and 91% of patients attributing no impact of coffee intake on IBD regularly drink coffee and surprisingly even 49% of those patients that assign a negative impact on disease symptoms. Among those patients refraining from regular coffee intake 62% are convinced that coffee adversely influences intestinal symptoms, significantly more in Crohn's disease (CD) than in ulcerative colitis (UC) (76% vs. 44%, p = 0.002). In total, 38% of all study subjects suppose that coffee has an effect on their symptoms of disease, significantly more in CD (54%) compared to UC patients (22%, p < 0.001). Moreover, while 45% of CD patients feel that coffee has a detrimental influence, only 20% of UC patients share this impression (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Two thirds of IBD patients regularly consume coffee. More than twice as many CD compared to UC patients attribute a symptom-modifying effect of coffee consumption, the majority a detrimental one. However, this negative perception does not result in abstinence from coffee consumption.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Exclusive polymeric diet enriched with transforming growth factor-beta 2 (ANS-TGF-beta2) has been used for remission induction and maintenance in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Its use in the preoperative setting has never been evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 to decrease postoperative complications after surgery for complicated ileocolonic CD. METHODS: From 2011 to 2015, data of all consecutive patients who underwent elective surgery for ileocolonic CD were collected prospectively. Preoperative, exclusive ANS-TGF-beta2 was administered in high-risk patients with complicated CD. Complicated CD was defined by the presence of obstructive symptoms, and/or steroid treatment, and/or preoperative weight loss >10% and/or perforating CD. Outcomes of high-risk patients receiving preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 were compared to those of low-risk patients with no complicated CD who underwent upfront surgery. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients underwent surgery for ileocolonic CD. Among them, 35 high-risk patients received preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 and 21 low-risk patients underwent upfront surgery. Preoperative full-dose ANS-TGF-beta2 was feasible in 34/35 high-risk patients. Discontinuation of steroids during preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 could be achieved in 10/16 patients (62.5%). Postoperative complications rates were 8/35 (23.8%) and 5/21 (22.9%) in high-risk and low-risk patients, respectively (p = 1). Temporary ileocolostomy rates in high-risk patients and in low-risk patients were 4/35 (11%) and 0/21, respectively (p = 0.286) Conclusion: Preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 is feasible in most high-risk patients with complicated ileocolonic CD and could limit the deleterious effects of risk factors of postoperative morbidity. These results need to be confirmed in a large randomized controlled trial.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Canada has amongst the highest incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the world, and the highest proportion of immigrants among G8 nations. We determined differences in prediagnosis delay, specialist care, health services use, and risk of surgery in immigrants with IBD. METHODS: All incident cases of IBD in children (1994-2009) and adults (1999-2009) were identified from population-based health administrative data in Ontario, Canada. Linked immigration data identified those who arrived to Ontario after 1985. We compared time to diagnosis, postdiagnosis health services use (IBD specific and related), physician specialist care in immigrants and nonimmigrants, and risk of surgery between immigrants and nonimmigrants. RESULTS: Thousand two hundred two immigrants were compared with 22,990 nonimmigrants. Immigrants had similar time to diagnosis as nonimmigrants for Crohn's (hazard ratio [HR] 1.002; 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 0.89-1.12) and ulcerative colitis (HR 1.073; 95% CI 0.95-1.21). For outpatient visits, immigrants with IBD were seen by gastroenterologists more often than nonimmigrants. Immigrants had greater IBD-specific outpatient health services use after diagnosis (odds ratio 1.24; 95% CI 1.15-1.33), emergency department visits (odds ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.30-1.91), and hospitalizations (odds ratio 1.19; 95% CI 1.02-1.40). In immigrants, there was lower risk of surgery for Crohn's (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43-0.99) and ulcerative colitis (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31-0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Immigrants to Canada had greater outpatient and specialty care and lower risk of surgery, with no delay in diagnosis, indicating appropriate use of the health system.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease [VEO-IBD] is a form of IBD that is distinct from that of children with an older onset. We compared changes over time in the incidence and phenotype at diagnosis between two groups according to age at IBD diagnosis: VEO-IBD diagnosed before the age of 6 years, and early-onset IBD [EO-IBD] diagnosed between 6 and 16 years of age. METHODS: Data were obtained from a cohort enrolled in a prospective French population-based registry from 1988 to 2011. RESULTS: Among the 1412 paediatric cases [< 17 years], 42 [3%] were VEO-IBD. In the VEO-IBD group, the incidence remained stable over the study period. In contrast, the incidence of EO-IBD increased from 4.4/105 in 1988-1990 to 9.5/105 in 2009-2011 [+116%; p < 10-4]. Crohn's disease [CD] was the most common IBD, regardless of age, but ulcerative colitis [UC] and unclassified IBD were more common in VEO-IBD cases [40% vs 26%; p = 0.04]. VEO-IBD diagnosis was most often performed in hospital [69% vs 43%; p < 10-3]. Rectal bleeding and mucous stools were more common in patients with VEO-IBD, whereas weight loss and abdominal pain were more frequent in those with EO-IBD. Regarding CD, isolated colonic disease was more common in the VEO-IBD group [39% vs 14%; p = 0.003]. CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based cohort, the incidence of VEO-IBD was low and stable from 1988 to 2011, with a specific clinical presentation. These results suggest a probable genetic origin for VEO-IBD, whereas the increase in EO-IBD might be linked to environmental factors.},

Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a common anti-inflammatory treatment in children with Crohn's disease in the European countries, and the mechanism is most likely linked to changes in the intestinal microbiome. In the present study, EEN was given in two treatment periods several months apart to a patient with very severe, disabling juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), with a remarkable clinical response as the result. The aim of the present study was to study how the EEN treatment influenced the microbiome and metabolome of this patient. Fecal samples from before, during, and between treatments with EEN were studied. The microbiome was analyzed by sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons using Illumina MiSeq, and the metabolome was analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance. The microbiome changed markedly from treatment with EEN, with a strong reduction of the Bacteroidetes phylum. Metabolic profiles showed clear differences before, during, and between treatment with EEN, where butyrate, propionate, and acetate followed a cyclic pattern with the lowest levels at the end of each treatment period. This patient with JIA showed remarkable clinical improvement after EEN treatment, and we found corresponding changes in both the fecal microbiome and the metabolome. Further studies are needed to explore the pathophysiological role of the intestinal canal in children with JIA.},

Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN), which may change the gut microbiota, is an effective anti-inflammatory treatment for Crohn's disease in children. We wanted to explore the immediate anti-inflammatory effect of EEN in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). METHODS: Thirteen patients with JIA (7-17 years of age), in a disease flare-up, were included in the study. Six children dropped out within 1.5-2.0 weeks of treatment, and seven patients continued, constituting the study cohort. EEN was given for three to eight weeks, with clinical and laboratory status assessed before and after treatment periods. In addition to conventional laboratory tests, 92 inflammatory proteins were analysed with a multiplex system (Proseek Multiplex Inflammation I, Olink Bioscience). RESULTS: EEN had a significant anti-inflammatory effect on active joints (p=0.031), JADAS27 (p=0.016) and morning stiffness (p=0.031). In the multiplex analysis of inflammatory proteins, MMP-1 (matrix metalloproteinase), involved in the degradation of collagens in chondrocytes, decreased significantly (p=0.047), as did MCP-4 (p=0.031) and 4E-BP1 (p=0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive enteral nutrition for three to eight weeks had anti-inflammatory effect in all children with JIA that continued with EEN for more than two weeks. The study is only exploratory but the result supports an immunologically important role for the intestinal canal in these patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we studied a cohort of patients with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to determine the frequency of mutations in the interleukin 10 (IL10) receptor genes as a cause of early-onset IBD. METHODS: Sanger sequencing was performed to determine the presence of IL10 and/or IL10 receptor mutations in 17 patients with a diagnosis of very early onset IBD (disease onset <2 years of age in 15 patients, between 3 and 4 years in the other 2). Mutation screening was performed including all of the coding regions of the IL10, IL10RA, and IL10RB genes. We then compared the follow-up findings of the patients with IL10 receptor mutations in terms of demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment response properties with those of patients diagnosed as having very early onset IBD with no mutation. RESULTS: We identified 3 patients bearing mutations in the IL10 or IL10 receptor genes, including 1 mutation in IL10RB that has been described recently (c.G477A, p.Trp159*) and 2 novel mutations affecting the IL10RA gene (c.T192G, p.Tyr64 and c.T133G, p.Trp45Gly). Collectively, these mutations thus provided genetic etiology for 17.6% of the cohort under investigation. The presence of a family history of IBD and the clinical course of Crohn disease differed between patients with mutations in the IL-10 pathway and those without such mutations. Although perianal fistulas were found in all of the patients with IL10 receptor mutations, they were found in only 14.3% of those without such mutations. The lower values of weight-for-age and height-for-age z scores, necessity for more intensive therapy, achievement of longer periods until remission, and frequent relapses in the patients bearing mutations in the IL10 receptor genes all underlined the severity of the disease and its relatively poor response to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the small number of patients with mutations affecting the IL-10 signaling pathway in our study, in all of the patients with IL10 receptor mutations, the disease onset occurs at an early age, the prognosis is poor, and the response to treatment is insufficient.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is frequently complicated by intestinal strictures, which are commonly treated by endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD). However, available data on this area of treatment is limited. The aim of this study was to depict the heterogeneity of endoscopic management of CD-associated strictures among international CD specialists to identify common treatment standards. METHODS: IBD experts of the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD), the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO), and from the Prospective Value In IBD trials (PROVIT) completed a web-based questionnaire to evaluate their endoscopic experience, practice setting, and number of EBDs performed annually. Additionally, two case scenarios and technical practice parameters were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 126 subjects from 15 countries completed the survey. The maximal length of dilated stricture was 4.5 +/- 1.7 cm. The most commonly used maximal balloon size was graded as 15-18 mm. While 87.2 % of the participants favored EBD for anastomotic strictures, only 58.6 % did so in the case of naive strictures. Only 35.7 % of physicians dilated actively inflamed strictures. Interventional endoscopists were more likely to dilate only clinically symptomatic strictures (p = 0.046). Surgeons favored surgical treatment of de novo ileocecal strictures compared to gastroenterologists (p = 0.026), reported a shorter stricture length being amendable by EBD (p = 0.045), and more frequently used concomitant therapies (p = 0.001). Operator experience increased the likelihood of EBD use in actively inflamed strictures (p = 0.002), maximum length of stricture, and maximum balloon size (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: EBD is a widely used treatment approach for stricturing CD. Individual approaches differ significantly based on background of the operator, experience level, and practice setting.},

Fibrostenosing Crohn's disease leads to a significantly impaired quality of life in affected patients and constitutes a challenging treatment situation. In the absence of specific medical antifibrotic treatment options, endoscopic or surgical therapy approaches with their potential harmful side effects are frequently used. However, our understanding of mechanisms of fibrogenesis in general and specifically intestinal fibrosis has emerged. Progression of fibrosis in the liver, lung, or skin can be halted or even reversed, and possible treatment targets have been identified. In face of this observation and given the fact that fibrotic alterations in various organs of the human body share distinct core characteristics, this article aims to address whether reversibility of intestinal fibrosis may be conceivable and to highlight promising research avenues and therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) causes lifelong, progressive bowel damage, which may be quantified using the Lemann Index (LI). We aimed to analyze patterns of LI and its association with 5-year clinical course, in an independent cohort of CD patients. METHODS: CD patients with 5-year follow-up from a registry maintained at a tertiary center were included. LI was calculated using a computerized metric from the first (LI1) and last (LI2) clinical encounters during the 5 years. Groups were created based on change in score (LI2-LI1) or the delta Lemann Index (DLI) as showing improvement, no change, or deterioration and used for association analysis with patterns of health care utilization, disease activity, and quality-of-life scores. RESULTS: A total of 363 CD patients with 5-year follow-up formed the study population [median age 43 y (interquartile range (IQR), 33.3 to 55 y); 57% female; median disease duration 12 y (IQR, 3 to 19 y), overall surgical exposure 69.7%]. Median (IQR) LI1, LI2, and DLI were 8 (0 to 54), 9 (0 to 75), and 0 (-22 to -47), respectively. Patients were stratified based on DLI into 3 groups: A: DLI<0; B: DLI=0; and C: DLI>0; which comprised 16.5%, 35.3%, and 48.2% of the cohort, respectively. Patients in group C had significantly higher CD-related surgical exposure, health care utilization, and annual use of steroids and biological agents. DLI showed independent significant positive correlation with perianal disease (P=0.044), steroid use (P=0.007), clinical visits (P<0.001), and new surgeries (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Change in LI over time could function as a marker of disease trajectory for risk substratification and prognostication in CD.},

AIM: To evaluate if patterns of anemia over time showed correlation with aggressive disease trajectory, as characterized by change in Lemann Index (LI), which is a metric that quantifies bowel damage. METHODS: CD patients with 5 year (y) follow-up from a prospective registry were included. LI was calculated from the first (LI1) and last (LI2) clinical encounters. The change in score (LI2-LI1) or the Delta LI (DLI) was recorded. Patterns of anemia, healthcare utilization and disease activity scores were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 389 CD patients with 5y follow-up formed the study population [median age 40y (IQR: 31-53); 57.3% female; median disease duration 12y (IQR: 6-20.5), overall surgical exposure 69%]. Patients with anemia had significantly higher LI1, LI2, DLI and also significantly higher healthcare utilization and indices of disease activity, than patients without anemia (p<0.001). CD patients with anemia for any duration during the study had OR of 2.15 (95% CI 1.29-3.57, p=0.003) for worsening bowel damage over the 5y. CONCLUSION: Based on a longitudinal analysis of CD patients, anemia status over time shows significant correlation with increasing Lemann index and aggressive disease trajectory.},

A majority of IF cases are associated with short-bowel syndrome, which is a result of malabsorption after significant intestinal resection for numerous reasons, some of which include Crohn's disease, vascular thrombosis, and radiation enteritis. IF can also be caused by obstruction, dysmotility, and congenital defects. Recognition and management of IF can be challenging, given the complex nature of this condition. This review discusses the management of IF with a focus on intestinal rehabilitation, parenteral nutrition, and transplantation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in clinical remission with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) have been labeled "silent CD" and have increased 2-year hospitalization rates when compared with asymptomatic patients with no biochemical evidence of inflammation. The risk of cumulative bowel damage in patients with silent CD is unknown. METHODS: Observational study of patients with CD prospectively followed in a tertiary referral natural history registry. Consecutive patients with CD in clinical remission (Harvey-Bradshaw Index </= 4) with good quality of life (short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire score >/= 50), and same day CRP measurement at first encounter, followed for a minimum of 4 years formed the study population. Disease trajectory was determined using change in Lemann Index as a measure of bowel damage. RESULTS: A total of 185 patients with CD (median age 42 years; 51.4% men) were included in the study. CRP elevation was observed in 43 (23%) patients (Silent CD cohort). Majority of them showed worsening disease trajectories based on change in Lemann Index when compared with asymptomatic patients with normal CRP (65% versus 36%, P < 0.0001). Multinomial logistic regression analysis demonstrated that elevated CRP was independently associated with 7-fold higher odds (odds ratio = 6.93, P < 0.0001) of having worse disease trajectories when compared with stable disease trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Two-thirds of patients with CD in clinical remission, while demonstrating elevated CRP, will develop bowel damage over the ensuing years, despite feeling well. These patients with silent CD are an "at-risk" group who warrant further investigation to prevent development of disease-related complications.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: No study to date has evaluated perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease-unclassified (IBDU) as compared with Crohn's colitis (CC) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which represent the diagnostic challenge. We aimed to explore the diagnostic utility of serology and to assess whether serology can predict disease severity in these subgroups. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective longitudinal study including 406 children with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) from 23 centers affiliated with the Porto group of European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (mean age 10.5 +/- 3.9, 54% males); 117 (29%) with CC, 143 (35%) with UC, and 146 (36%) with IBDU. Median follow-up period was 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.6-4.2). RESULTS: The most prevalent serologic profile in IBDU was pANCA-/ASCA- (41%), followed by pANCA+/ASCA- (34%) and pANCA-/ASCA+ (17%). pANCA-/ASCA+ differentiated well between CC versus IBDU (83% specificity, 96% positive predictive value [PPV]) and UC (97% specificity, 90% PPV) patients, albeit with a low negative predictive value (13% and 40%, respectively). pANCA+/ASCA- did not differentiate as well between IBD subgroups, but UC children with pANCA+/ASCA- had more often severe disease at diagnosis (36 [62%] versus 22 [38%], P = 0.033) and needed more often calcineurin inhibitors, biologics, or colectomy (25 [80%] versus 6 [20%], P = 0.026). In CC, double positivity for ASCA and not pANCA-/ASCA+ profile was associated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Serology may have some role in predicting disease course and outcomes in colonic IBD, but its routine use needs to be supported by more studies. Serology cannot routinely be recommended for differentiating between IBDU versus CC or UC as a sole diagnostic criterion given its low diagnostic utility.},

METHODS: A retrospective chart review was done to identify patients' clinical data, disease phenotype, treatment history, and laboratory and growth parameters before treatment with ustekinumab and at last follow-up. Adverse events while on ustekinumab were also recorded. RESULTS: Four adolescent patients with Crohn disease at our center received ustekinumab. All had previously received corticosteroids, methotrexate, azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine, and both infliximab and adalimumab. Patients had varying disease phenotypes. Ages at ustekinumab initiation were 12, 13, 16, and 17 years. Weight ranged from 40.5 to 57.8 kg, mean 49.5 kg. Two patients showed clinical response and remain on ustekinumab. Two patients discontinued therapy because of continued symptoms and disease complications and required multiple hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Ustekinumab was used in 4 children with pediatric Crohn disease with 2 of 4 patients showing clinical response (1 with persistently elevated C-reactive protein). A prospective study is needed to define its efficacy, safety, and placement in managing pediatric Crohn disease in the future.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Metastatic Crohn's disease (MCD) is an extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease, with biopsy as fundamental diagnostic tool. There are few references to MCD in children, with a 0.5-1% estimated incidence in adults. There is no consensus about its therapeutic approach. We describe our diagnostic and therapeutic experience in MCD. RESULTS: Four cases of MCD are described in our Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit in a tertiary care hospital. The age at diagnosis was between 7 and 13 years. Lesions appeared before the diagnosis of Crohn's disease in three of them, and during the course of the disease in another one, with genital location in three patients and bilateral pretibial region in the other. All four cases demonstrated non-caseificant granulomas on biopsy. Only two patients used exclusive enteral nutrition therapy with complete resolution, while other two cases received a combination of therapies (corticosteroids, azathioprine, tacrolimus, infliximab and adalimumab) because of recurrence. Only one case required surgery after poor clinical control. CONCLUSION: The MCD is infrequent but must always be included in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous lesions in Crohn's disease, considering it could be the debut of the disease. We will rely on biopsy anyway for definitive diagnosis. In this series the genital region is verified as the most commonly affected in children. The therapeutic approach does not differ from the management of intestinal involvement.},

Intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) has been identified as a marker for intestinal damage and correlates with the degree of inflammation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether I-FABP can predict active disease or remission in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in a real-life IBD cohort. METHODS: In total, 70 patients with endoscopic disease activity available and 194 patients with disease activity on the basis of a stringent combi-score of clinical activity index, C-reactive protein, and fecal calprotectin were included. Plasma I-FABP was compared between patients with active disease and remission. In a small subgroup of CD patients, follow-up samples were analyzed. RESULTS: In CD (139.2 vs. 119.2 pg/ml; P=0.37) and UC (107.8 vs. 151.8 pg/ml; P=0.33), the median I-FABP did not differ in endoscopic active disease versus remission. In UC patients with active disease on the basis of the combi-score, the median I-FABP (106.8 vs. 172.0 pg/ml; P=0.03) was significantly lower than in patients in remission, but not in CD (145.5 vs. 157.5 pg/ml; P=0.29). Neither disease location in CD nor extent of disease in UC influenced I-FABP significantly. I-FABP was not different (P=0.78) in CD patients with a change in disease activity over time. CONCLUSION: Plasma I-FABP did not differ between endoscopic active disease and remission in both CD and UC. I-FABP was lower in active UC but not CD on the basis of the combi-score. On the basis of these findings, I-FABP has no potential as a novel noninvasive biomarker for disease activity in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disappearance of macroscopic mucosal inflammation predicts long-term outcome in Crohn's disease (CD). It can be assessed by ileocolonoscopy, which is, however, an invasive and expensive procedure. Disease activity indices do not correlate well with endoscopic activity and noninvasive markers have a low sensitivity in subgroups of patients. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath are of increasing interest as noninvasive markers. The aim of this study was to investigate whether VOCs can accurately differentiate between active CD and remission. METHODS: Patients participated in a 1-year follow-up study and Harvey-Bradshaw index, blood, fecal, and breath samples were collected at regular intervals. Patients were stratified into 2 groups: active (fecal calprotectin >250 microg/g) or inactive (Harvey-Bradshaw index <4, C-reactive protein <5 mg/L, and fecal calprotectin <100 microg/g) disease. Breath samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Random forest analyses were used to find the most discriminatory VOCs. RESULTS: Eight hundred thirty-five breath-o-grams were measured, 140 samples were assigned as active, 135 as inactive disease, and 110 samples of healthy controls. A set of 10 discriminatory VOCs correctly predicted active CD in 81.5% and remission in 86.4% (sensitivity 0.81, specificity 0.80, AUC 0.80). These VOCs were combined into a single disease activity score that classified disease activity in more than 60% of the previously undetermined individuals. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that VOCs can separate healthy controls and patients with active CD and CD in remission in a real-life cohort. Analysis of exhaled air is an interesting new noninvasive application for monitoring mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Uromodulin (UMOD)/Tamm-Horsfall protein, the most abundant human urinary protein, plays a key role in chronic kidney diseases and is a promising therapeutic target for hypertension. Via its bipartite zona pellucida module (ZP-N/ZP-C), UMOD forms extracellular filaments that regulate kidney electrolyte balance and innate immunity, as well as protect against renal stones. Moreover, salt-dependent aggregation of UMOD filaments in the urine generates a soluble molecular net that captures uropathogenic bacteria and facilitates their clearance. Despite the functional importance of its homopolymers, no structural information is available on UMOD and how it self-assembles into filaments. Here, we report the crystal structures of polymerization regions of human UMOD and mouse ZP2, an essential sperm receptor protein that is structurally related to UMOD but forms heteropolymers. The structure of UMOD reveals that an extensive hydrophobic interface mediates ZP-N domain homodimerization. This arrangement is required for filament formation and is directed by an ordered ZP-N/ZP-C linker that is not observed in ZP2 but is conserved in the sequence of deafness/Crohn's disease-associated homopolymeric glycoproteins alpha-tectorin (TECTA) and glycoprotein 2 (GP2). Our data provide an example of how interdomain linker plasticity can modulate the function of structurally similar multidomain proteins. Moreover, the architecture of UMOD rationalizes numerous pathogenic mutations in both UMOD and TECTA genes.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyze the usefulness of fecal lactoferrin in the diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children. The study included 52 children with IBD (24 with Crohn's disease and 28 with ulcerative colitis) aged between 0.92 and 18 years, and 41 IBD-free controls of similar age. Fecal concentration of lactoferrin was determined with a quantitative immunoenzymatic test. Fecal concentration of lactoferrin in children with IBD was significantly higher than in the controls. The cut-off value of fecal lactoferrin concentration optimally distinguishing between the children with IBD and the controls was identified as 13 mug/g. The sensitivity and specificity of this cut-off value equaled 80.7% and 92.7%, respectively, and its positive and negative prognostic values were 96.8% and 63.3%, respectively. Patients diagnosed with moderate Crohn's disease had significantly higher fecal concentrations of lactoferrin than children with the mild or inactive disease. Similarly, children with moderate ulcerative colitis showed significantly higher fecal concentrations of lactoferrin than individuals with the mild condition. No significant relationship was found between the fecal concentration of lactoferrin and the severity of endoscopic lesions. Patients with IBD and a positive result of fecal occult blood test were characterized by significantly higher concentrations of lactoferrin than the individuals with IBD and a negative result of this test. In conclusion, fecal concentration of lactoferrin seems to be a useful parameter for diagnosis and monitoring of IBD in children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In case of a loss of response to adalimumab, some patients with Crohn's disease may derive benefit from increasing the dosing frequency to 40 mg weekly. Efficacy and safety of adalimumab 80 mg weekly remain unknown. METHODS: From February 2011 to September 2012, all adults who had active Crohn's disease, defined at least by Crohn's disease activity index >150 and 1 objective sign of inflammation, and required an adalimumab dose escalation to 80 mg weekly were enrolled in a prospective multicenter cohort study. Crohn's disease activity index and C-reactive protein levels were recorded during the first 14 weeks following adalimumab optimization and at 6 months. All adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were included. The median age was 33 years, and the median disease duration was 8.6 years. Adalimumab was associated with steroids in 28% of cases and with immunomodulators in 10% of patients. Within the 14 weeks after adalimumab optimization, 14 patients (33.3%) achieved clinical remission (Crohn's disease activity index <150), and 23 patients (54.8%) had a clinical response. Clinical improvement was associated with a drop in the C-reactive protein level from 18 to 5 mg/L (P = 0.0008). After a median follow-up of 14.5 months, 5 patients underwent major abdominal surgery. Adverse events were reported in 13 patients (31%). CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab 80 mg weekly seems to be well-tolerated and may be effective in inducing clinical remission in patients with luminal Crohn's disease who failed to respond to 40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) cause significant morbidity and are increasing in prevalence among all populations, including African Americans. More than 200 susceptibility loci have been identified in populations of predominantly European ancestry, but few loci have been associated with IBD in other ethnicities. METHODS: We performed 2 high-density, genome-wide scans comprising 2345 cases of African Americans with IBD (1646 with CD, 583 with UC, and 116 inflammatory bowel disease unclassified) and 5002 individuals without IBD (controls, identified from the Health Retirement Study and Kaiser Permanente database). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated at P < 5.0 x 10-8 in meta-analysis with a nominal evidence (P < .05) in each scan were considered to have genome-wide significance. RESULTS: We detected SNPs at HLA-DRB1, and African-specific SNPs at ZNF649 and LSAMP, with associations of genome-wide significance for UC. We detected SNPs at USP25 with associations of genome-wide significance for IBD. No associations of genome-wide significance were detected for CD. In addition, 9 genes previously associated with IBD contained SNPs with significant evidence for replication (P < 1.6 x 10-6): ADCY3, CXCR6, HLA-DRB1 to HLA-DQA1 (genome-wide significance on conditioning), IL12B,PTGER4, and TNC for IBD; IL23R, PTGER4, and SNX20 (in strong linkage disequilibrium with NOD2) for CD; and KCNQ2 (near TNFRSF6B) for UC. Several of these genes, such as TNC (near TNFSF15), CXCR6, and genes associated with IBD at the HLA locus, contained SNPs with unique association patterns with African-specific alleles. CONCLUSIONS: We performed a genome-wide association study of African Americans with IBD and identified loci associated with UC in only this population; we also replicated IBD, CD, and UC loci identified in European populations. The detection of variants associated with IBD risk in only people of African descent demonstrates the importance of studying the genetics of IBD and other complex diseases in populations beyond those of European ancestry.},

   abstract = {Canada has one of the highest rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the disease represents a significant health, social, and economic burden. There is currently no cure for IBD, although earlier diagnosis and new therapies have improved the overall health outcomes and quality of life for patients. Crohn's and Colitis Canada is Canada's only national, volunteer-based charity dedicated to finding cures for IBD and improving the lives of those affected, through research, education, patient programs, advocacy, and increased awareness. On April 30, 2015, Crohn's and Colitis Canada hosted the "Patient and Healthcare Professional Summit on the Burden of Disease in IBD" to obtain a deeper understanding of the unmet needs of IBD patients and their caregivers. Through personal vignettes, patients articulated a pressing need to increase understanding of the challenges faced by people suffering from IBD among both health care professionals and the general public, develop best practices for navigating life transitions and addressing the unique challenges faced by children with IBD, and provide equitable access to appropriate, effective, and affordable treatments. The recommendations that emerged from the summit will inform about efforts to increase public awareness, inform about advocacy strategies, and contribute to the development of research priorities.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Young individuals with Crohn disease (CD) are at risk of poor bone mineral density (BMD) and reduced lean tissue mass (LTM). The importance of LTM for maintaining skeletal health, in both incident and established CD, is evidenced. We used dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry assessment to identify areal BMD and LTM in individuals with CD. METHODS: In 57 patients with CD (15F; 12.99-14.16 years) anthropometric, disease activity, bone age assessment, and total body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measurements were acquired. A 4-step algorithm was used to assess simultaneous bone and body composition data: areal BMD and height z scores, and LTM for height and bone mineral content (BMC) for LTM z scores were calculated. Low z score cut-off values were defined as </=1 standard deviations below the population means. RESULTS: The CD cohort showed: low areal BMD z scores (P = 0.00); and low LTM for height (P = 0.00) according to defined cut-off values. BMC appeared to be adapting for the lower amount of LTM. Correcting for bone age eliminated the low areal BMD z scores. As expected, LTM for height and BMC for LTM z scores remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: We present a useful clinical algorithm to show significant LTM for height deficits, regardless of chronological or bone age, in this CD cohort. BMC seemed to adapt to the reduced LTM, indicating clinically "normal" areal BMD for age when considered for height. The ongoing deficits in LTM may, however, create chronic long-term consequences for bone health. Improving LTM should be a focus of clinical treatment in individuals with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) is a potent amplifier of inflammation. Recently, the antimicrobial peptide PGLYRP-1 was shown to be the ligand of TREM-1. Here, the ability of an anti-TREM-1 antibody to dampen the release of proinflammatory cytokines by colon lamina propria cells (LPCs) from patients with IBD was investigated and correlated with PGLYRP-1 levels. METHODS: Biopsies from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 45) or Crohn's disease (CD, n = 26) were compared with those from individuals undergoing colonoscopy for other reasons (n = 17). TREM-1 expression was analyzed on myeloid cells by flow cytometry. Cell culture experiments with LPCs were used to analyze PGLYRP-1 and inflammatory cytokine levels and assess the effect of anti-TREM-1 on cytokine secretion. RESULTS: The frequency of TREM-1-expressing neutrophils and recruited macrophages was higher in inflamed than in noninflamed biopsies. The PGLYRP-1 level in inflamed tissue was higher than in noninflamed tissue; it was produced primarily by neutrophils, and its level correlated with the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Secretion of myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-8 by LPCs stimulated with the potent TREM-1 agonist consisting of PGLYRP-1 complexed with peptidoglycan was reduced in the presence of anti-TREM-1. Moreover, a blocking effect of anti-TREM-1 was apparent when LPCs from a subset of inflamed individuals with elevated PGLYRP-1 were stimulated with killed bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: An anti-TREM-1 antibody can dampen secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in inflamed patients with elevated PGLYRP-1. Moreover, PGLYRP-1 + myeloperoxidase is a potential biomarker for predicting the effect of anti-TREM-1 therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can arise at any age, with peak incidence in adolescence and young adulthood. A registry of pediatric cases of IBD offers the opportunity to document their diagnosis and treatment, with the ultimate aim of improving diagnosis and treatment in the future. METHODS: In the German-language CEDATA-GPGE registry, 3991 cases of IBD in patients less than 18 years of age were documented from 2004 to 2014. The 1257 patients who were prospectively included in the registry upon diagnosis and whose further course was documented for at least three months were analyzed in two separate groups--under 10 years old, and 10 years and above--with respect to the type and duration of their symptoms until diagnosis, the completeness of the diagnostic evaluation, the disease phenotype, and the initial treatment. RESULTS: Of the 958 patients for whom full documentation was available, 616 (64.3%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 278 (29%) had ulcerative colitis (UC), 64 (6.7%) had an unclassified IBD, and 23.2% were under 10 years old. The latency to diagnosis was longer for CD than for UC (0.5 versus 0.3 years), regardless of age. 62.5% of the CD patients had ileocolonic involvement, and more than half had involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract. 71% of the patients with UC had subtotal colitis or pancolitis. Continuous improvement was seen in diagnostic assessment according to published guidelines. For example, in 2004/2005, 69% of patients were evaluated endoscopically with ileocolonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy; this fraction had risen to nearly 100% by 2013/2014. Similarly, the percentage of patients who underwent a diagnostic evaluation of the small intestine, as recommended, rose from 41.2% to 60.9% over the same period. The most common initial treatments were 5- amino - salicylates (86.8% CD, 100% UC) and glucocorticoids (60.6% CD, 65.6% UC). 32% of the patients with CD received exclusive enteral nutrition therapy. CONCLUSION: Most of these pediatric patients with IBD, whether in the younger or the older age group, had extensive bowel involvement at the time of diagnosis. The registry data imply that improvement in clinical course may be achieved by shortening the time to diagnosis and by closer adherence to the diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) as nutritional therapy for maintenance of remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Retrospective chart review was conducted in 11 pediatric patients with CD who initiated the SCD as therapy at time of diagnosis or flare. Two groups defined as SCD simple (diet alone, antibiotics or 5-ASA) or SCD with immunomodulators (corticosteroids and/or stable thiopurine dosing) were followed for one year and compared on disease characteristics, laboratory values and anthropometrics. RESULTS: The mean age at start of the SCD was 11.8 +/- 3.0 years (range 6.6-17.6 years) with five patients starting the SCD within 5 wk of diagnosis. Three patients maintained a strict SCD diet for the study period and the mean time for liberalization was 7.7 +/- 4.0 mo (range 1-12) for the remaining patients. In both groups, hematocrit, albumin and ESR values improved while on strict SCD and appeared stable after liberalization (P-value 0.006, 0.002, 0.002 respectively). The majority of children gained in weight and height percentile while on strict SCD, with small loss in weight percentile documented with liberalization. CONCLUSION: Disease control may be attainable with the SCD in pediatric CD. Further studies are needed to assess adherence, impact on mucosal healing and growth.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is a systemic chronic inflammatory condition mainly characterized by discontinuous transmural pathology of the gastrointestinal tract and frequent extraintestinal manifestations with intermittent episodes of remission and relapse. Genome-wide association studies identified a number of risk loci that, catalyzed by environmental triggers, result in the loss of tolerance toward commensal bacteria based on dysregulated innate effector functions and antimicrobial defense, leading to exacerbated adaptive immune responses responsible for chronic immune-mediated tissue damage. In this review, we discuss the inter-related role of changes in the intestinal microbiota, epithelial barrier integrity, and immune cell functions on the pathogenesis of CD, describing the current approaches available to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. Substantial effort has been dedicated to define disease-associated changes in the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis) and to link pathobionts to the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases. A cogent definition of dysbiosis is lacking, as well as an agreement of whether pathobionts or complex shifts in the microbiota trigger inflammation in the host. Among the rarely available animal models, SAMP/Yit and TNF(deltaARE) mice are the best known displaying a transmural CD-like phenotype. New hypothesis-driven mouse models, e.g., epithelial-specific Caspase8(-/-), ATG16L1(-/-), and XBP1(-/-) mice, validate pathway-focused function of specific CD-associated risk genes highlighting the role of Paneth cells in antimicrobial defense. To study the causal role of bacteria in initiating inflammation in the host, the use of germ-free mouse models is indispensable. Unraveling the interactions of genes, immune cells and microbes constitute a criterion for the development of safe, reliable, and effective treatment options for CD.},

   abstract = {Single-nucleotide variations in C13orf31 (LACC1) that encode p.C284R and p.I254V in a protein of unknown function (called 'FAMIN' here) are associated with increased risk for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, leprosy and Crohn's disease. Here we set out to identify the biological mechanism affected by these coding variations. FAMIN formed a complex with fatty acid synthase (FASN) on peroxisomes and promoted flux through de novo lipogenesis to concomitantly drive high levels of fatty-acid oxidation (FAO) and glycolysis and, consequently, ATP regeneration. FAMIN-dependent FAO controlled inflammasome activation, mitochondrial and NADPH-oxidase-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the bactericidal activity of macrophages. As p.I254V and p.C284R resulted in diminished function and loss of function, respectively, FAMIN determined resilience to endotoxin shock. Thus, we have identified a central regulator of the metabolic function and bioenergetic state of macrophages that is under evolutionary selection and determines the risk of inflammatory and infectious disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Biological agents are being increasingly used in the UK for paediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) despite limited evidence and safety concerns. We evaluated effectiveness and safety in the clinical setting, highlighting drug cost pressures, using our national Scottish PIBD biological registry. METHODS: Complete usage of the biological agents, infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) for treatment of PIBD (in those aged <18 years) from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2010 was collated from all treatments administered within the Scottish Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (PGHAN) national managed service network (all regional PGHAN centres and paediatric units within their associated district general hospitals). RESULTS: 132 children had biological therapy; 24 required both agents; 114 had Crohn's disease (CD), 16 had ulcerative colitis (UC) and 2 had IBD Unclassified (IBDU). 127 children received IFX to induce remission; 61 entered remission, 49 had partial response and 17 had no response. 72 were given maintenance IFX and 23 required dose escalation. 18 had infusion reactions and 27 had adverse events (infections/other adverse events). 29 had ADA to induce remission (28 CD and 1 UC), 24 after IFX; 10 entered remission, 12 had partial response and 7 had no response. All had maintenance; 19 required dose escalation. 12 children overall required hospitalisation due to drug toxicity. No deaths occurred with either IFX or ADA. CONCLUSIONS: Complete accrual of the Scottish nationwide 'real-life' experience demonstrates moderate effectiveness of anti tumour necrosis factor agents in severe PIBD but duration of effect is limited; significant financial issues (drug cost-need for dose escalation and/or multiple biological usage) and safety issues exist.},

   abstract = {Despite improvements in medical therapies for Crohn's disease (CD), up to 70% of patients require surgery within 10 years of diagnosis. Surgery is not curative, and almost all patients will experience endoscopic recurrence, and many will go on to clinical recurrence. Identifying patients at high-risk of endoscopic recurrence and standardizing postoperative assessments are essential in preventing clinical recurrence of CD. In this review, we discuss the assessment, monitoring, and treatment of postoperative CD patients. We address the various individual risk factors as well as composite risk factors. Medications used for primary CD treatment can be used in the postoperative setting to prevent endoscopic or clinical recurrence with varying efficacy, although the cost-effectiveness of these approaches are not fully understood. Future directions for postoperative CD management include evaluation of newer biologic agents such as anti-integrin therapy and fecal microbiota transplant for prevention of recurrence. Development of a standard preoperative risk assessment tool to clearly stratify those at high-risk of recurrence is necessary to guide empiric therapy. Lastly, the incorporation of noninvasive testing into disease monitoring will likely lead to early detection of endoscopic recurrence that will allow for tailored treatment to prevent clinical recurrence.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Thymus-derived regulatory T cells (Tregs) mediate dominant peripheral tolerance and treat experimental colitis. Tregs can be expanded from patient blood and were safely used in recent phase 1 studies in graft versus host disease and type 1 diabetes. Treg cell therapy is also conceptually attractive for Crohn's disease (CD). However, barriers exist to this approach. The stability of Tregs expanded from Crohn's blood is unknown. The potential for adoptively transferred Tregs to express interleukin-17 and exacerbate Crohn's lesions is of concern. Mucosal T cells are resistant to Treg-mediated suppression in active CD. The capacity for expanded Tregs to home to gut and lymphoid tissue is unknown. METHODS: To define the optimum population for Treg cell therapy in CD, CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo)CD45RA(+) and CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo)CD45RA(-) Treg subsets were isolated from patients' blood and expanded in vitro using a workflow that can be readily transferred to a good manufacturing practice background. RESULTS: Tregs can be expanded from the blood of patients with CD to potential target dose within 22-24 days. Expanded CD45RA(+) Tregs have an epigenetically stable FOXP3 locus and do not convert to a Th17 phenotype in vitro, in contrast to CD45RA(-) Tregs. CD45RA(+) Tregs highly express alpha4beta7 integrin, CD62L and CC motif receptor 7 (CCR7). CD45RA(+) Tregs also home to human small bowel in a C.B-17 severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) xenotransplant model. Importantly, in vitro expansion enhances the suppressive ability of CD45RA(+) Tregs. These cells also suppress activation of lamina propria and mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes isolated from inflamed Crohn's mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo)CD45RA(+) Tregs may be the most appropriate population from which to expand Tregs for autologous Treg therapy for CD, paving the way for future clinical trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Aspirin use reduces colorectal cancer risk. Aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, inhibits prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2 or cyclooxygenase-2); PTGS2 promotes inflammation and suppresses T-cell-mediated adaptive immunity. We investigated whether the inverse association of aspirin use with colorectal carcinoma risk was stronger for tumors with lower degrees of lymphocytic infiltrates than for tumors with higher degrees of lymphocytic infiltrates. METHODS: We collected aspirin use data biennially from participants in the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Participants were asked whether they took aspirin in most weeks, the number of tablets taken per week, and years of aspirin use. We collected available tumor specimens (n = 1458) from pathology laboratories in the United States. A pathologist confirmed the diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma (excluding anal squamous cell carcinoma), and evaluated histopathology features, including patterns and degrees of lymphocytic infiltrates within and around tumor areas. Person-years of follow-up evaluation were accrued from the date of return of questionnaires until dates of colorectal cancer diagnosis, death, or the end of follow-up evaluation (June 2010). Duplication-method Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association of aspirin with the incidence of colorectal carcinoma subgroups according to the degree of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), intratumoral periglandular reaction, peritumoral reaction, or Crohn's-like reaction. RESULTS: We documented 1458 rectal and colon cancers. The inverse association between regular aspirin use and colorectal cancer risk significantly differed by concentrations of TILs (Pheterogeneity = .007). Compared with nonregular use, regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of tumors that had low levels of TILs (relative risk, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.81), and strength of the association depended on aspirin dose and duration (both Ptrend < .001). In contrast, aspirin use was not associated with a risk of tumors having intermediate or high levels of TILs. This differential association was consistent regardless of the status of tumor microsatellite instability, mutations in BRAF, or expression of PTGS2. Regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of tumors that contained low levels of CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, or CD45RO (PTPRC)+ T cells (measured by immunohistochemistry and computer-assisted image analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Based on data from the prospective cohort studies, regular use of aspirin is associated with a lower risk of colorectal carcinomas with low concentrations of TILs. These findings indicate that the immune response in the tumor microenvironment could be involved in the chemopreventive effects of aspirin.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has increased over the last 50 years. It is now recognized that several genetic defects can express an IBD-like phenotype at very early onset (<6 years). AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review was to update knowledge concerning the specificity of IBD at onset <6 years, which can include conventional/standard IBD as well as monogenic IBD-like diseases. Expert commentary: We found that females are less prone than males to develop monogenic disorders, which have X-linked heritability in several cases. Furthermore, the Crohn's Diseases (CD) subtype seems to be suggestive of monogenic disorders while Unclassified IBD (IBDU) subtype is predominantly found in conventional/standard IBD at onset <6 years. Isolated colonic location is prevalent in both the subsets of IBD at onset <6 years if compared to IBD at later onset. Monogenic disorders require more aggressive medical and surgical treatments and can be complicated by the occurrence of lymphomas.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Parenteral methotrexate is an effective treatment for patients with Crohn's disease, but has never been adequately evaluated in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine its safety and efficacy in patients with steroid-dependent UC. METHODS: We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of parenteral methotrexate (25 mg/wk) in 111 patients with corticosteroid-dependent UC at 26 medical centers in Europe from 2007 through 2013. Patients were given prednisone (10 to 40 mg/d) when the study began and were randomly assigned to groups (1:1) given placebo or methotrexate (intramuscularly or subcutaneously, 25 mg weekly) for 24 weeks. The primary end point was steroid-free remission (defined as a Mayo score </=2 with no item >1 and complete withdrawal of steroids) at week 16. Secondary endpoints included clinical remission (defined as a Mayo clinical subscore </=2 with no item >1) and endoscopic healing without steroids at weeks 16 and/or 24, remission without steroids at week 24, and remission at both weeks 16 and 24. RESULTS: Steroid-free remission at week 16 was achieved by 19 of 60 patients given methotrexate (31.7%) and 10 of 51 patients given placebo (19.6%)--a difference of 12.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.0% to 28.1%; P = .15). The proportion of patients in steroid-free clinical remission at week 16 was 41.7% in the methotrexate group and 23.5% in the placebo group, for a difference of 18.1% (95% CI: 1.1% to 35.2%; P = .04). The proportions of patients with steroid-free endoscopic healing at week 16 were 35% in the methotrexate group and 25.5% in the placebo group--a difference of 9.5% (95% CI: -7.5% to 26.5%; P = .28). No differences were observed in other secondary end points. More patients receiving placebo discontinued the study because of adverse events (47.1%), mostly caused by UC, than patients receiving methotrexate (26.7%; P = .03). A higher proportion of patients in the methotrexate group had nausea and vomiting (21.7%) than in the placebo group (3.9%; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized controlled trial, parenteral methotrexate was not superior to placebo for induction of steroid-free remission in patients with UC. However, methotrexate induced clinical remission without steroids in a significantly larger percentage of patients, resulting in fewer withdrawals from therapy due to active UC.

   abstract = {This article reports the findings of what it means to live with intestinal failure caused by Crohn disease and how it influences daily life. Ten patients, 7 with an ostomy and 7 on home parenteral nutrition followed up at an outpatient clinic for patients with intestinal failure, were interviewed using a qualitative, phenomenological-hermeneutic method. The analysis of the transcribed data is described thematically and resulted in 3 main themes; (a) struggling to not be controlled by the disease, (b) walking on a thin thread, and (c) being seen as a person, not just as a patient. These themes led to the comprehensive understanding that living with intestinal failure was interpreted as the criticality of maintaining control over one's life and body while maintaining autonomy and not letting the disease conquer life. Life entails a constant struggle with much planning to live as normally as possible and get the most out of life. It was of great importance to be seen as a person and not just as a disease, affirm that life as it is has meaning, there is a state of suffering related to the disease, there are existential issues, and suffering is related to care.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) incidence is increasing among low-risk populations. This study examined a cohort of Canadian South Asian (SA) children with IBD to determine if their disease course differed from non-SA (NSA) children. METHODS: Children of SA ethnicity diagnosed with IBD between 1997 and 2012 were identified and compared with NSA children. Data on duration and the type of presenting symptoms, disease phenotype, corticosteroid exposure (CS), exclusive enteral nutrition use, time to commencement of immunomodulator (IM), biologic therapy, and surgical intervention were extracted. RESULTS: Overall, 160 SA children were identified and compared with 783 NSA patients (Crohn's disease [CD]: 44% versus 72%; ulcerative colitis [UC]: 43% versus 21%; IBD-Unclassified: 13% versus 7%; P < 0.001). SA patients were predominantly second-generation Canadians (92%) and had shorter symptom duration (2 versus 4 months; P < 0.001). SA CD patients were less likely to have a parent with IBD (1% versus 14%; P = 0.003). SA patients had more extensive colonic disease (CD: 55% versus 35%; P = 0.005; UC: 77% versus 58%; P = 0.006); SA CD patients presented with more complicated disease (B2/B3: 39% versus 27%; P = 0.006) and UC patients presented with more severe disease (49% versus 23%; P < 0.001). In SA CD patients, CS use was higher (70% versus 58%; P = 0.045), and IM and biologic therapy were commenced earlier (P = 0.027; P = 0.047). SA UC patients were more likely to need CS and IM (P = 0.024; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data describe an ethnically unique clinical phenotype, where SA children have a higher proportion of UC, shorter symptom duration, more extensive colonic disease, and are more likely to require earlier escalation of therapy.},

The antioxidant mineral selenium (Se) was measured in serum samples from 106 IBD patients (53 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 53 with Crohn's disease (CD)) and from 30 healthy controls. Serum Se concentrations were significantly lower in UC and CD patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001) and significantly lower in CD patients than in UC patients (p = 0.006). Se concentrations in patients were significantly influenced by sex, body mass index (BMI), the inflammatory biomarker alpha-1-antitrypsin, surgery, medical treatment, the severity, extent, and form of the disease and the length of time since onset (p < 0.05). Se concentrations in IBD patients were positively and linearly correlated with nutritional (protein, albumin, prealbumin, cholinesterase and total cholesterol) and iron status-related (hemoglobin, Fe and hematocrit) parameters (p < 0.05). A greater impairment of serum Se and cardiovascular status was observed in CD than in UC patients. An adequate nutritional Se status is important in IBD patients to minimize the cardiovascular risk associated with increased inflammation biomarkers, especially in undernourished CD patients, and is also related to an improved nutritional and body iron status.},

Doctors are going to play a major role as they are being called on to adapt their practices to confront it. In particular, nutrition seems to be at the core of obesity in children. The ascending trend of this phenomenon in pediatric age, with inherent healthcare implications, was already reported in epidemiological studies of the mid '90s. Public health programs of primary prevention should be stimulated and recommended, with the aim of promoting diet and lifestyle changes in the general population. In addition, accurate anthropometric measurements should be performed for use by pediatricians, who should focus efforts on preventing obesity during infancy and childhood. Nutrition plays such a pivotal role that it may be considered a valuable treatment strategy for multiple pediatric conditions, including celiac disease, Crohn's disease, short bowel syndrome, galactosemia, congenital deficiency of urea cycle enzymes. In view of all this, it would be advisable that food science be given higher relevance in medical education.},

The aim of this survey was to analyze the multicenter Belgian ITx experience. From 1999 to 2014, 24 ITx in 23 patients were performed in Belgium, divided over five centers. Median recipient age was 38 years (8 months-57 years); male/female ratio was 13/10; six were children; and 17 adults. Intestinal failure was related to intestinal ischemia (n = 5), volvulus (n = 5), splanchnic thrombosis (n = 4), Crohn (n = 2), pseudo-obstruction (n = 2), microvillus inclusion (n = 2), Churg-Strauss (n = 1), necrotizing enterocolitis (n = 1), intestinal atresia (n = 1), and chronic rejection (n = 1). Graft type was isolated ITx (n = 9), combined liver-ITx (n = 11) and multivisceralTx (n = 4). One was a living donor-related transplantation and five patients received simultaneously a kidney graft. Early acute rejection occurred in 8; late acute rejection in 4; and chronic rejection in 2. Two patients developed a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Nine patients have died. Among 14 survivors at last follow-up, 11 have been transplanted for more than 1 year. None of the latter has developed renal failure, and all were nutritionally independent with a Karnofsky score > 90%. One-/five-year patient and graft survivals were 71.1%, 62.8%, 58.7% and 53.1%, respectively. Based on this experience, ITx has come of age in Belgium as a lifesaving and potentially quality of life restoring therapy.},

   abstract = {Much has been written about the role of diet and risk for Crohn's disease (CD). However, the evidence is contradictory. Recent evidence has pointed to fiber playing an important role along with the possibility that dietary fat and overnutrition also have a role. Diet has a clearer place in disease modification, with some diets used in the treatment of CD. The lack of clarity stems from a poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between diet and CD. Gut permeability is likely to play a key role in the risk for CD. Mechanisms whereby diet can affect gut permeability, including the effects of the gut microbiota, are reviewed. Modification of disease behavior is likely to be influenced by additional mechanisms, including recognition of complex food antigens. As with many other chronic diseases, a surrogate marker of CD risk would greatly aid evaluation of the dietary factors involved. Formal measures of gut permeability are too cumbersome for large-scale use, but fecal calprotectin may be a convenient measure of this. There are only preliminary data on the effect of diet and microbiota composition on fecal calprotectin and these require further investigation.},

   abstract = {Emerging data have highlighted the co-existence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and inflammatory bowel disease; both of which are increasingly prevalent disorders with significant complications and impact on future health burden. Cross-section observational studies have shown widely variable prevalence rates of co-existing disease, largely due to differences in disease definition and diagnostic tools utilised in the studies. Age, obesity, insulin resistance and other metabolic conditions are common risks factors in observational studies. However, other studies have also suggested a more dominant role of inflammatory bowel disease related factors such as disease activity, duration, steroid use and prior surgical intervention, in the development of NAFLD. This suggests a potentially more complex pathogenesis and relationship between the two diseases which may be contributed by factors including altered intestinal permeability, gut dysbiosis and chronic inflammatory response. Commonly used immunomodulation agents pose potential hepatic toxicity, however no definitive evidence exist linking them to the development of hepatic steatosis, nor are there any data on the impact of therapy and prognosis in patient with co-existent diseases. Further studies are required to assess the impact and establish appropriate screening and management strategies in order to allow early identification, intervention and improve patient outcomes.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprised of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is believed to develop as a result of a deregulated inflammatory response to environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals. Despite advances in understanding the genetic risks of IBD, associated single nucleotide polymorphisms have low penetrance, monozygotic twin studies suggest a low concordance rate, and increasing worldwide IBD incidence leave gaps in our understanding of IBD heritability and highlight the importance of environmental influences. Operating at the interface between environment and heritable molecular and cellular phenotypes, microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Studies to date have identified unique miRNA expression profile signatures in IBD and preliminary functional analyses associate these deregulated miRNAs to canonical pathways associated with IBD pathogenesis. In this review, we summarize and discuss the miRNA expression signatures associated with IBD in tissue and peripheral blood, highlight miRNAs with potential future clinical applications as diagnostic and therapeutic targets, and provide an outlook on how to develop miRNA based therapies.},

This study aimed to systematically review all published clinical trials evaluating the effects of a regular diet on symptoms of IBD. Three medical databases were searched for clinical trials evaluating an intervention that involved dietary manipulation using a regular diet on adults with IBD whose symptoms were objectively measured before and after the intervention. The most common types of regular diet interventions that we observed in the literature fell into the following three categories: low residue/low fiber diets, exclusion diets, or other specific diets. Of all included studies, the few that were of higher quality and that observed a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in the diet group compared to the control group fell under the exclusion diet group or the other specific diet group. We were able to identify several high quality clinical trials evaluating dietary manipulations on symptoms of IBD. Exclusion diets and the low FODMAP diet are two areas identified in this review that show promise for having therapeutic benefits for patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves dysregulation of mucosal immunity in response to environmental factors such as the gut microbiota. The bacterial microbiota is often altered in IBD, but the connection to disease is not fully clarified and gut fungi have recently been suggested to play a role as well. In this study, we compared microbes from all 3 domains of life-bacteria, archaea, and eukaryota-in pediatric patients with IBD and healthy controls. METHODS: A stool sample was collected from patients with IBD (n = 32) or healthy control subjects (n = 90), and bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities were characterized by deep sequencing of rRNA gene segments specific to each domain. RESULTS: Patients with IBD (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) had lower bacterial diversity and distinctive fungal communities. Two lineages annotating as Candida were significantly more abundant in patients with IBD (P = 0.0034 and P = 0.00038, respectively), whereas a lineage annotating as Cladosporium was more abundant in healthy subjects (P = 0.0025). There were no statistically significant differences in archaea, which were rare in pediatric samples compared with those from adults. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric IBD is associated with reduced diversity in both fungal and bacterial gut microbiota. Specific Candida taxa were found to be increased in abundance in the IBD samples. These data emphasize the potential importance of fungal microbiota signatures as biomarkers of pediatric IBD, supporting their possible role in disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {Perianal fistula is a complication of Crohn's disease that carries a high morbidity. It is a channel that develops between the lower rectum, anal canal and perianal or perineal skin. The development of perianal fistulas typically connotes a more aggressive disease phenotype and may warrant escalation of treatment to prevent poor outcomes over time. Based on fistula anatomy, debris can form inside these tracts and cause occlusion, which subsequently leads to abscess formation, fever and malaise. The clinical presentation is often with complaints of pain, continuous rectal drainage of fecal matter as well as malodorous discharge. Considering that the presence of fistulas often indicates refractory and aggressive disease, early identification of its presence is important. Some patients may not have the classic symptoms of fistulizing disease at presentation and others may have significant scarring and/or pain from previous fistulizing episodes, which can make an accurate assessment on physical exam alone problematic. As a result, utilizing diagnostic imaging is the best means of identifying the early signs of perianal fistulas or abscess formation in these patients. Several imaging modalities exist which can be used for diagnosis and management. Endoscopic ultrasound and pelvic MRI are considered the most useful in establishing the diagnosis. However, a combination of multiple imaging modalities and/or examination under anesthesia is probably the most ideal. Incomplete characterization of the fistula tract(s) extent or the presence of abscess carries a high morbidity and far-reaching personal expense for the patient - promoting worsening of the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) has the highest prevalence in Ashkenazi Jewish populations. We sought to identify rare, CD-associated frameshift variants of high functional and statistical effects. METHODS: We performed exome sequencing and array-based genotype analyses of 1477 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals with CD and 2614 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals without CD (controls). To validate our findings, we performed genotype analyses of an additional 1515 CD cases and 7052 controls for frameshift mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 2-receptor beta common subunit gene (CSF2RB). Intestinal tissues and blood samples were collected from patients with CD; lamina propria leukocytes were isolated and expression of CSF2RB and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-responsive cells were defined by adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF analysis). Variants of CSF2RB were transfected into HEK293 cells and the expression and functions of gene products were compared. RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, we associated CD with a frameshift mutation in CSF2RB (P = 8.52 x 10(-4)); the finding was validated in the replication cohort (combined P = 3.42 x 10(-6)). Incubation of intestinal lamina propria leukocytes with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor resulted in high levels of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT5) and lesser increases in phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and AK straining transforming (AKT). Cells co-transfected with full-length and mutant forms of CSF2RB had reduced pSTAT5 after stimulation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, compared with cells transfected with control CSF2RB, indicating a dominant-negative effect of the mutant gene. Monocytes from patients with CD who were heterozygous for the frameshift mutation (6% of CD cases analyzed) had reduced responses to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and markedly decreased activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase; activity of this enzyme has been associated with immune tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: In a genetic analysis of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, we associated CD with a frameshift mutation in CSF2RB. Intestinal monocytes from carriers of this mutation had reduced responses to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, providing an additional mechanism for alterations to the innate immune response in individuals with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD), mucosal healing has become a major goal, with the hope of avoiding intestinal damage from chronic inflammation. Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) has emerged as a non-invasive means of monitoring inflammation and damage. AIMS: As part of the development of MRE-based multi-item measures of inflammation and damage for paediatric studies, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify MRE variables used to describe these two distinct concepts. METHODS: 2501 studies of MRI and CD were identified. Studies written in any language reporting individual MRE signs for patients diagnosed with CD were included. Two-hundred-and-forty-four studies were fully reviewed and 62 were included (inflammation, n = 51; damage, n = 24). Sensitivity, specificity and associated confidence intervals were calculated, and hierarchical summary ROC curves were constructed for each MRE sign. RESULTS: A total of 22 MRE signs were used to reflect inflammation, and 9 to reflect damage. Diagnostic accuracy of MRE signs of inflammation and damage was heterogeneous; however, wall enhancement, mucosal lesions and wall T2 hyperintensity were the most consistently useful for inflammation (most sensitivities >80% and specificities >90%), and detection of abscess and fistula were most consistently useful for damage (most sensitivities >90%, specificities >95%). CONCLUSIONS: Identifying the best MRE variables to reflect inflammation and damage will maximise the utility of this rapidly emerging technique and is the first stage of constructing MRE-based indices for evaluating inflammation and intestinal damage.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Under both physiological and pathological conditions, bone volume is determined by the rate of bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts. Excessive bone loss is a common complication of human IBD whose mechanisms are not yet completely understood. Despite the role of activated CD4(+) T cells in inflammatory bone loss, the nature of the T cell subsets involved in this process in vivo remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to identify the CD4(+) T cell subsets involved in the process of osteoclastogenesis in vivo, as well as their mechanism of action. DESIGN: CD4(+) T cells were studied in IL10-/- mice and Rag1-/- mice adoptively transferred with naive CD4(+)CD45RB(high) T cells, representing two well-characterised animal models of IBD and in patients with Crohn's disease. They were phenotypically and functionally characterised by flow cytometric and gene expression analysis, as well as in in vitro cocultures with osteoclast precursors. RESULTS: In mice, we identified bone marrow (BM) CD4(+) T cells producing interleukin (IL)-17 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha as an osteoclastogenic T cell subset referred to as Th17 TNF-alpha(+) cells. During chronic inflammation, these cells migrate to the BM where they survive in an IL-7-dependent manner and where they promote the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes, the main osteoclast progenitors. A population equivalent to the Th17 TNF-alpha(+) cells was also detected in patients with Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the osteoclastogenic function of the Th17 TNF-alpha(+) cells that contribute to bone loss in vivo in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease; treatment strategies have historically been determined by this binary categorisation. Genetic studies have identified 163 susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease, mostly shared between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. We undertook the largest genotype association study, to date, in widely used clinical subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease with the goal of further understanding the biological relations between diseases. METHODS: This study included patients from 49 centres in 16 countries in Europe, North America, and Australasia. We applied the Montreal classification system of inflammatory bowel disease subphenotypes to 34,819 patients (19,713 with Crohn's disease, 14,683 with ulcerative colitis) genotyped on the Immunochip array. We tested for genotype-phenotype associations across 156,154 genetic variants. We generated genetic risk scores by combining information from all known inflammatory bowel disease associations to summarise the total load of genetic risk for a particular phenotype. We used these risk scores to test the hypothesis that colonic Crohn's disease, ileal Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis are all genetically distinct from each other, and to attempt to identify patients with a mismatch between clinical diagnosis and genetic risk profile. FINDINGS: After quality control, the primary analysis included 29,838 patients (16,902 with Crohn's disease, 12,597 with ulcerative colitis). Three loci (NOD2, MHC, and MST1 3p21) were associated with subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease, mainly disease location (essentially fixed over time; median follow-up of 10.5 years). Little or no genetic association with disease behaviour (which changed dramatically over time) remained after conditioning on disease location and age at onset. The genetic risk score representing all known risk alleles for inflammatory bowel disease showed strong association with disease subphenotype (p=1.65 x 10(-78)), even after exclusion of NOD2, MHC, and 3p21 (p=9.23 x 10(-18)). Predictive models based on the genetic risk score strongly distinguished colonic from ileal Crohn's disease. Our genetic risk score could also identify a small number of patients with discrepant genetic risk profiles who were significantly more likely to have a revised diagnosis after follow-up (p=6.8 x 10(-4)). INTERPRETATION: Our data support a continuum of disorders within inflammatory bowel disease, much better explained by three groups (ileal Crohn's disease, colonic Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis) than by Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as currently defined. Disease location is an intrinsic aspect of a patient's disease, in part genetically determined, and the major driver to changes in disease behaviour over time.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory condition requiring significant healthcare expenditure. Subgroups of individuals contribute disproportionately to spending. We aimed to determine demographic and clinical factors predictive of high healthcare expenditures for IBD patients followed over a multiyear period. METHODS: This was a registry analysis using a prospective observational, consented, natural history registry from a tertiary IBD center and associated medical charges, not including pharmacy expenses. The 100 patients with the highest medical charges (top 5%) were compared with the median 300 patients. Logistic regression determined demographic and clinical factors associated with high charge patients. RESULTS: IBD patients in the high charge group had significantly more unemployment (P < 0.0001), were of black race (P = 0.013), comorbid psychiatric illness (P = 0.002), hypertension (P = 0.01), diabetes (P = 0.004), opiate use (P < 0.0001), perianal involvement (P = 0.002), penetrating disease (P < 0.0001), and extensive colitis (P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, unemployment (Crohn's disease [CD]: odds ratio [OR], 3.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-7.02; ulcerative colitis [UC]: OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.20-5.99), psychiatric illness (UC: OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.03-4.19), opiates (CD: OR, 5.61; 95% CI, 2.67-11.82; UC: OR, 5.14; 95% CI, 2.52-10.48), prior surgery (CD: OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.59-6.82; UC: OR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.39-5.32), penetrating CD (OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.02-10.62), and corticosteroid requirement (CD: OR, 3.78; 95% CI, 1.86-7.65; UC: OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.51-5.90) remained independently associated with high charges. CONCLUSIONS: High expenditure IBD patients were affected by more severe disease. The high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and chronic pain in these patients suggests the need for focused treatment of these comorbidities ultimately to reduce financial burden.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient-reported Crohn's disease (CD) symptoms and endoscopic evaluation have historically guided routine care, but the risk of complications in asymptomatic patients with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of patients with CD from a tertiary care center. Subjects with short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire scores >/= 50, Harvey-Bradshaw CD scores </= 4, and same-day CRP measurement were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was disease-related hospitalization up to 24 months after the qualifying clinic visit. We assessed the relationship between CRP elevation and subsequent hospitalization. RESULTS: There were 351 asymptomatic patients with CD (median age 40 yr; 50.4% female) who met inclusion criteria, and CRP was elevated in 19.7% of these individuals (n = 69). At 24 months, 16.8% (n = 59) of the study population had been hospitalized for CD-related complications. Significantly, more patients with an elevated CRP were hospitalized (33.3% versus 12.8%, P < 0.0001) compared with those with a normal CRP and were hospitalized at increased rate (P < 0.001) on Kaplan-Meier analysis. CRP elevation was significantly and independently associated with increased risk of hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 2.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.98; P = 0.02) in multivariable survival analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic patients with CD with elevated CRP are at a nearly 2-fold higher risk for hospitalization over the subsequent 2 years compared with asymptomatic patients with CD without CRP elevation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: L-arginine (L-Arg) is the substrate for both inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS2) and arginase (ARG) enzymes. L-Arg is actively transported into cells by means of cationic amino acid transporter (SLC7) proteins. We have linked L-Arg and arginase 1 activity to epithelial restitution. Our aim was to determine if L-Arg, related amino acids, and metabolic enzymes are altered in ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Serum and colonic tissues were prospectively collected from 38 control subjects and 137 UC patients. Dietary intake, histologic injury, and clinical disease activity were assessed. Amino acid levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were measured by real-time PCR. Colon tissue samples from 12 Crohn's disease patients were obtained for comparison. RESULTS: Dietary intake of arginine and serum L-Arg levels were not different in UC patients versus control subjects. In active UC, tissue L-Arg was decreased, whereas L-citrulline (L-Cit) and the L-Cit/L-Arg ratio were increased. This pattern was also seen when paired involved (left) versus uninvolved (right) colon tissues in UC were assessed. In active UC, SLC7A2 and ARG1 mRNA levels were decreased, whereas ARG2 and NOS2 were increased. Similar alterations in mRNA expression occurred in tissues from Crohn's disease patients. In involved UC, SLC7A2 and ARG1 mRNA levels were decreased, and NOS2 and ARG2 increased, when compared with uninvolved tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with UC exhibit diminished tissue L-Arg, likely attributable to decreased cellular uptake and increased consumption by NOS2. These findings combined with decreased ARG1 expression indicate a pattern of dysregulated L-Arg availability and metabolism in UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab is effective for inducing and maintaining remission in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, there is limited pediatric data. This study aimed to describe the adverse events and clinical response to vedolizumab in refractory pediatric IBD. METHODS: Disease activity indices, clinical response, concomitant medication use, and adverse events were measured over 22 weeks in an observational prospective cohort study of children with refractory IBD who had failed anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy and subsequently initiated vedolizumab therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects, 16 with Crohn disease, received vedolizumab. Clinical response was observed in 6/19 (31.6%) of the evaluable subjects at week 6 and in 11/19 (57.9%) by week 22. Before induction, 15/21 (71.4%) participants were treated with systemic corticosteroids, as compared with 7/21 (33.3%) subjects at 22 weeks. Steroid-free remission was seen in 1/20 (5.0%) subjects at 6 weeks, 3/20 (15.0%) at 14 weeks, and 4/20 (20.0%) at 22 weeks. There was statistically significant improvement in serum albumin and hematocrit; however, C-reactive protein increased by week 22 (P < 0.05). There were no infusion reactions. Vedolizumab was discontinued in 2 patients because of severe colitis, requiring surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited experience with vedolizumab therapy in pediatric IBD. There seems to be a marked number of subjects with clinical response in the first 6 weeks that increases further by week 22 despite the severity of disease in this cohort. Adverse events may not be directly related to vedolizumab. This study is limited by small sample size, and larger prospective studies are warranted.},

   abstract = {In healthy gut enteric glial cells (EGC) are essential to intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) functions. In Crohn's Disease (CD), both EGC phenotype and IEB functions are altered, but putative involvement of EGC in CD pathogenesis remains unknown and study of human EGC are lacking. EGC isolated from CD and control patients showed similar expression of glial markers and EGC-derived soluble factors (IL6, TGF-beta, proEGF, GSH) but CD EGC failed to increase IEB resistance and healing. Lipid profiling showed that CD EGC produced decreased amounts of 15-HETE, 18-HEPE, 15dPGJ2 and 11betaPGF2alpha as compared to healthy EGC. They also had reduced expression of the L-PGDS and AKR1C3 enzymes. Produced by healthy EGC, the 11betaPGF2 activated PPARgamma receptor of intestinal epithelial cells to induce cell spreading and IEB wound repair. In addition to this novel healing mechanism our data show that CD EGC presented impaired ability to promote IEB functions through defect in L-PGDS-AKR1C3-11betaPGF2alpha dependent pathway.},

Both disease processes can share similar clinical symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia, and weight loss; CD can also be complicated by penetrating and fistulizing disease. Perianal skin tags, perianal abscesses, recto-cutaneous fistulae, and rectal stenosis are among the phenotypic characteristics of perianal CD. Current treatment strategies are focused on the surgical drainage of abscesses and the closure of fistulous tracts as well as controlling intestinal inflammation with the use of immunomodulators (6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate) and biologics (infliximab and adalimumab). Current guidelines by the American Gastroenterology Association and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition recommend a combination of surgical intervention and medical management for the treatment of perianal CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of current smoking on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) course has been studied extensively; smoking is deleterious in Crohn's disease (CD), and beneficial in ulcerative colitis (UC). Except for enteral nutrition, there are only limited data regarding the impact of diet on disease course. KEY MESSAGES: Current smoking worsens the course of CD, increasing the incidence of flares, the need for steroids, immunosuppressants and re-operations. Conversely, smoking cessation has a rapid beneficial effect on disease course, decreasing the risk of flares and of post-operative recurrences. From 3 months after the quit date, quitters have a disease course similar to that of never smokers. Achieving smoking cessation in CD is thus an important goal of therapy. On the contrary, smoking improves the course of UC and in particular, is associated with a decreased need for colectomy. Smoking cessation increases the risk of flare and the need for steroids or immunosuppressants. However, patients with UC should not be discouraged to quit, because the beneficial effect of smoking for their disease is counterbalanced by the deleterious systemic effects of tobacco. Among dietary interventions, only exclusive enteral nutrition was shown to induce remission and achieve mucosal healing in some patients with CD. The beneficial effect of liquid-defined diet is observed whatever be the type of administration (orally or by tube), the type of diet regarding protein and fat content and resulting alterations in the gut microbiota. In UC, enteral nutrition has no effect. Finally, popularized restrictive diets in IBD as the specific-carbohydrate diet and the gluten-free diet have not been rigorously tested. In a small trial, a semi-vegetarian diet was shown to be effective in maintaining remission over 2 years in CD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD should not smoke and avoid passive smoking. Aside from the defined liquid diets, there is no rationale for advising particular diets.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between nutrition and Crohn's disease (CD) is complex and involves several therapeutic possibilities including: nutrition treatment for malnourished patients, optimization of growth and development, prevention of osteoporosis, first-line therapy for active disease, and maintenance of disease remission. In children and adolescents with CD, malnutrition is a common problem that adversely affects the prognosis. In at-risk adolescent CD patients, it is important to assess body composition, food intake, energy expenditure, nutrient balance and serum levels of nutrients before planning interventions for this population. The aim of this study was to provide a snapshot of the nutritional status of adolescents with CD in Brazil. METHODS: We prospectively selected 22 patients with mildly to moderately active CD, 29 patients with inactive CD and 35 controls (first-degree relatives of and in the same age bracket as the CD patients). The age range of participants was between 13.2 and 19.4 years old. We collected anthropometric data including weight, height, and body mass index (BMI), which were expressed as Z scores: weight-for-age, height-for-age and BMI-for-age, respectively, as well as using bioimpedance to determine body composition and assessing the Tanner stage. We also assessed macronutrients and micronutrients (serum levels and dietary intake of both). We used the chi-square test to determine whether any of the studied variables were associated with inactive or active CD. The level of significance was set at 5 % (p < 0.05). We have written informed parental consent for participation for any minors and written informed consent for any participants that were adults. RESULTS: The mean values for lean body mass, Tanner stage, height-for-age Z score and BMI-for-age Z score were lower in the active CD group than in the inactive CD and control groups (p < 0.05 for both). Compared with the controls, the CD patients showed significant differences in terms of the quality of dietary intake (particularly in caloric intake, dietary protein intake, dietary fiber intake, and micronutrient intake), which were reflected in the serum levels of nutrients, mainly vitamins A and E (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with CD (including those with mildly to moderately active or inactive disease) have a nutritional risk, which makes it important to conduct nutritional assessments in such patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Adalimumab, a humanised anti-tumour necrosis factor antibody, is an effective treatment in adult patients with refractory Crohn disease (CD). The available literature on its efficacy in children remains limited. We aimed to evaluate the real-world efficacy in paediatric patients with CD and compare the efficacy between infliximab (IFX) nonresponders and patients who lost response to IFX. METHODS: All Dutch patients with CD receiving adalimumab before the age of 18 years after previous IFX therapy were identified. We analysed longitudinal disease activity, assessed by the mathematically weighted Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (wPCDAI) or the physician global assessment (PGA), and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Fifty-three patients with CD were included. Twelve patients received monotherapy and the others received combination treatment with thiopurines (n = 21), methotrexate (n = 11), steroids (n = 7), or exclusive enteral nutrition (n = 2). Median follow-up was 12 months (interquartile range 5-23). Remission was reached in 34 patients (64%, wPCDAI < 12.5 or PGA = 0) after a median of 3.3 months, and maintained by 50% for 2 years. Eleven patients (21%) reached response but not remission (decrease in wPCDAI >/= 17.5 or decrease in PGA). Eighteen patients (34%) failed adalimumab treatment because of nonresponse (n = 4), lost response (n = 11), or AEs (n = 3). More IFX nonresponders failed adalimumab treatment than patients who lost response to IFX (2/3 vs 8/34, hazard ratio 18.8, 95% confidence interval 1.1-303.6). Only 1 patient encountered a serious AE, a severe but nonfatal infection. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice, adalimumab induces remission in two-thirds of children with IFX refractory CD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease predominantly affecting the gastrointestinal tract. CD usually requires lifelong medication and is accompanied by severe complications, such as fistulae and strictures, resulting in surgery. Infliximab (IFX) is very effective for treating paediatric patients with CD, but is currently only registered for therapy refractory patients-the so-called step-up strategy. We hypothesise that using IFX first-line, that is, top-down, will give more mucosal healing, fewer relapses, less complications, need for surgery and hospitalisation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This international multicentre open-label randomised controlled trial includes children, aged 3-17 years, with new-onset, untreated CD with moderate-to-severe disease activity (weighted Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (wPCDAI)>40). Eligible patients will be randomised to top-down or step-up treatment. Top-down treatment consists of 5 IFX infusions combined with azathioprine (AZA). After these 5 infusions, patients will continue AZA. Patients randomised to step-up will receive standard induction treatment, either oral prednisolone or exclusive enteral nutrition, combined with AZA as maintenance treatment. The primary outcome is clinical remission (wPCDAI<12.5) at 52 weeks without need for additional CD-related therapy or surgery. Total follow-up is 5 years. Secondary outcomes include clinical disease activity, mucosal healing by endoscopy (at week 10 and optionally week 52), faecal calprotectin, growth, quality of life, medication use and adverse events. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. Medical-ethical approval will be obtained for each site.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), comprised of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are chronic disorders characterized by worsening of symptoms followed by symptom-free periods. Symptoms have a profound negative impact on quality of life and are associated with increased health care utilization. Despite effective treatments, outcomes are suboptimal secondary to nonadherence, medication intolerance, inconsistent monitoring, poor patient knowledge and limited access to care. OBJECTIVES: Compare disease activity and quality of life over 1 year in a randomized trial of IBD patients receiving standard care versus telemedicine. METHODS: Patients evaluated at 3 IBD referral centers with worsening symptoms within the last 2 years are eligible for randomization to one of two interventions or standard care. The interventions consist of either every other week or weekly assessment of symptoms, side effects, weight and delivery of medication prompts and education via texts to the participant's mobile phone. Individualized alerts and action plans are created on a secure portal. Participants in the standard care group undergo routine and urgent follow-up visits and telephone calls. The primary outcomes group comparisons of changes in disease activity and quality of life scores from baseline to 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Methods such as telemedicine are needed to improve monitoring, adherence, self-efficacy, and patient knowledge in IBD. If effective, telemedicine should decrease symptoms, improve quality of life, and decrease health care utilization. The burden associated with use of telemedicine for patients and providers needs to be assessed. The trial is ongoing and will be completed in July 2016.},

Patients with IASC often require re-operation or drainage to control the sepsis and have an increased frequency of disease recurrence. The aim of this article was to examine the factors affecting postoperative IASC in Crohn's disease after anastomoses, since some risk factors remain controversial. Studies investigating IASC in Crohn's operations were included, and all risk factors associated with IASC were evaluated: nutritional status, presence of abdominal sepsis, medication use, Crohn's disease type, duration of disease, prior operations for Crohn's, anastomotic technique, extent of resection, operative timing, operative length, and perioperative bleeding. In this review, the factors associated with an increased risk of IASC are preoperative weight loss, abdominal abscess present at time of surgery, prior operation, and steroid use. To prevent IASC in Crohn's patients, preoperative optimization with nutritional supplementation or drainage of abscess should be performed, or a diverting stoma should be considered for patients with multiple risk factors.},

We hypothesized that anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) alpha therapy may improve dietary intake and have a beneficial influence on body composition in these patients. METHODS: Our study involved 40 IBD outpatients (33 Crohn's disease, 7 ulcerative colitis); 24 of these received adalimumab (160/80/40EOW) and 16 were treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg at week 0, 2, 6, and subsequently every 8 weeks). Body composition was measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis, while dietary intake was recorded prior to initiating biologicals and 3 months afterwards. Body composition indexes: fat-free mass index [FFMI], body fat mass index [BFMI]) were calculated in kg/m2. RESULTS: Baseline BMI (kg/m2) and muscle parameters increased significantly at the end of the observational period (BMI: 23.81+/-7.19 vs. 24.52+/-7.34, p<0.001; FFMI: 17.64+/-3.00 vs. 18.14+/-3.08, p<0.001; at week 0 vs. 12, respectively). However, no significant changes were detected in the fat parameters (BFMI: 6.21+/-5.20 vs. 6.44+/-5.27, respectively). We found no significant difference between the effects of adalimumab vs. infliximab on body composition (deltaFFMI: 0.55+/-0.82 vs. 0.43+/-0.69; deltaBFMI: 0.23+/-0.85 vs. 0.21+/-1.01, respectively). No significant difference was observed in the extent of changes in parameters whether the patients were on corticosteroids (n=15) or not (n=25) at week 0 (deltaFFMI: 0.44+/-0.84 vs 0.59+/-0.72; deltaBFMI: 0.36+/-1.12 vs. 0.09+/-0.71, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that muscle parameters improved during the anti-TNF induction therapy, while fat parameters did not change significantly. Thus, induction anti-TNF therapy might have a beneficial effect on body composition.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic disease characterized by episodic and disabling inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract in genetically susceptible individuals. The incidence and prevalence of CD is rising rapidly across the world emphasising that disease risk is also influenced by environmental and lifestyle factors, as well as the microbial community resident in the gut. Childhood-onset CD is associated with an aggressive disease course that can adversely impact patient growth and development. There is no cure for CD however new onset and recurrent cases of paediatric CD are often responsive to exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) treatment. EEN treatment involves the exclusive consumption of an elemental or polymeric formula for several weeks and it is well established as a primary intervention strategy. EEN treatments typically achieve remission rates of over 80% and importantly they are associated with a high rate of mucosal healing, far superior to steroids, which is prognostic of improved long-term health outcomes. Furthermore, they are safe, have few side effects, and improve nutritional status and linear growth. Surprisingly, despite the utility of EEN our understanding of the host-microbe-diet interactions that underpin clinical remission and mucosal healing are limited. Here, we review the current state of knowledge and propose that the induction of autophagy, in addition to modulation of the microbiota and coordinated effects on inflammation and epithelial cell biology, may be critical for the therapeutic effects associated with EEN. A better understanding of EEN treatment will provide new opportunities to restore gut homeostasis and prolong periods of remission, as well as provide new insights into the factors that trigger and perhaps prevent CD.},

   abstract = {Functional bowel disorders (FBD), mainly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional constipation (FC, also called chronic idiopathic constipation), are very common worldwide. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, although less common, has a strong impact on patients' quality of life, as well as being highly expensive for our healthcare. A definite cure for those disorders is still yet to come. Over the years, several therapeutic approaches complementary or alternative to traditional pharmacological treatments, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fibre and herbal medicinal products, have been investigated for the management of both groups of diseases. However, most available studies are biased by several drawbacks, including small samples and poor methodological quality. Probiotics, in particular Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacilli (among which Lactobacillus rhamnosus), synbiotics, psyllium, and some herbal medicinal products, primarily peppermint oil, seem to be effective in ameliorating IBS symptoms. Synbiotics and fibre seem to be beneficial in FC patients. The probiotic combination VSL#3 may be effective in inducing remission in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis, in whom Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 seems to be as effective as mesalamine in maintaining remission. No definite conclusions can be drawn as to the efficacy of fibre and herbal medicinal products in IBD patients due to the low number of studies and the lack of randomized controlled trials that replicate the results obtained in the individual studies conducted so far. Thus, further, well-designed studies are needed to address the real role of these therapeutic options in the management of both FBD and IBD.

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) diarrhea can be caused by exacerbation and/or infectious agents. Fecal calprotectin (FC) is a well-established biomarker of intestinal inflammation in IBD. However, its usefulness in depiction of IBD exacerbation from infectious diarrhea is limited. The value of fecal pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type 2 (M2-PK) in this application remains unknown. AIM: To compare the performance of M2-PK and FC in discriminating between diarrhea caused by IBD and infectious agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred three patients were enrolled for the study, including 32 with ulcerative colitis (UC), 21 with Crohn's disease (CD), 29 with acute diarrhea caused by rotavirus (AD-RV), and 21 with acute diarrhea caused by Salmonella enteritidis (AD-SE). M2-PK and FC were measured using ELISA. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), sensitivities and specificities for both tests in distinguishing between patient subgroups with moderate to severe UC and CD from AD-RV and AD-SE were calculated. RESULTS: Differences in AUCs between M2-PK and FC for distinguishing UC [CD] from AD-RV were -0.06 (p < 0.028) [-0.10 (p < 0.0018)] and for differentiating UC [CD] from AD-SE were 0.03 (NS) [-0.19(p < 0.0011)].M2-PK sensitivities and specificities in distinguishing UC [CD] from AD-RV were 75.0%[71.4%] and 89.7% [89.7%] and for differentiation of UC [CD] from AD-SE were 56.3% [71.4%] and 95.2[57.1%]. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of M2-PK in distinguishing between children with moderate-to-severe IBD and patients with infectious gastroenteritis was inferior to FC. Neither test had sensitivity ands pecificity sufficient for everyday clinical application.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron sucrose (IS) in iron deficient children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in remission. METHODS: Electronic medical records at a university based pediatric children's hospital were searched for patients in age range 0 to 18 years with diagnosis of IBD and treatment with IS over a 1-year period. Response to IS treatment was assessed by posttreatment changes in ferritin, hemoglobin (Hb), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Patients with recorded symptoms of active disease were excluded from analysis of treatment response. RESULTS: Twelve patients were identified by the search criteria, 10 with Crohn's disease (CD), 2 with ulcerative colitis (UC). Data represent 8 patients in remission, 7 with CD and 1 with UC, who received a total of 34 IS infusions. Iron sucrose was administered in cycles of 2 infusions, 2.5 to 3.5 mg/kg/dose (maximum 200 mg), 1 week apart. Mean ferritin increased from 21.4 +/- 9.2 to 52.9 +/- 10.1 ng/mL (p = 0.0005), Hb from 10.9 +/- 0.4 to 11.3 +/- 0.3 g/dL (p = 0.02), and MCV from 76.9 +/- 2 to 79.4 +/- 2 fl (p = 0.006). Iron sucrose treatment normalized ferritin in 6 of 7, Hb in 2 of 8, and MCV in 2 of 5 patients with low pretreatment levels. No adverse effects were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Two IS infusions of 2.5 to 3.5 mg/kg/dose (maximum 200 mg), given 1 week apart normalized ferritin levels in most pediatric IBD patients in remission without adverse effects. Further studies are needed to determine optimal dosing schedules.},

Presented herein is a dual flow microfluidic device which holds full thickness human intestinal tissue in a known orientation. The luminal and serosal sides are independently perfused ex vivo with nutrients with simultaneous waste removal for up to 72 h. The microfluidic device maintains the viability and integrity of the tissue as demonstrated through Haematoxylin & Eosin staining, immunohistochemistry and release of lactate dehydrogenase. In addition, the inflammatory state remains in the tissue after perfusion on the device as determined by measuring calprotectin levels. It is anticipated that this human model will be extremely useful for studying the biology and testing novel interventions in diseased tissue.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Belgian registry for paediatric Crohn disease (BELCRO) cohort is a prospective, multicentre registry for newly diagnosed paediatric patients with Crohn disease (CD) (<18 years) recruited from 2008 to 2010 to identify predictive factors for disease activity and growth. METHODS: Data from the BELCRO database were evaluated at diagnosis, 24 and 36 months follow-up. RESULTS: At month 36 (M36), data were available on 84 of the 98 patients included at diagnosis. Disease activity evolved as follows: inactive 5% to 70%, mild 19% to 24%, and moderate to severe 76% to 6%. None of the variables such as age, sex, diagnostic delay, type of treatment, disease location, disease activity at diagnosis, and growth were associated with disease activity at M36. Paediatricians studied significantly less patients with active disease at M36 compared with adult physicians. Sixty percent of the patients had biologicals as part of their treatment at M36. Adult gastroenterologists initiated biologicals significantly earlier. They were the only factor determining biologicals' initiation, not disease location or disease severity at diagnosis. Median body mass index (BMI) z score evolved from -0.97 (range -5.5-2.1) to 0.11 (range -3.4-2) and median height z score from -0.15 (range -3.4-1.6) to 0.12 (range -2.3-2.3) at M36. None of the variables mentioned above influenced growth over time. CONCLUSIONS: Present treatment strategies lead to good disease control in the BELCRO cohort after 3 years. Logistic regression analysis did not show any influence of disease location or present treatment strategy on disease activity and growth, but patients under paediatric care had significantly less severe disease at M36.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacteria play a role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in IBD. Compositional alterations may also change the metabolic capacities of the gut bacteria. OBJECTIVE: To examine the metabolic activity of the microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), UC or pouchitis compared with healthy controls (HC) and determine whether eventual differences might be related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained from 40 HC, 83 patients with CD, 68 with UC and 13 with pouchitis. Disease activity was assessed in CD using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, in UC using the UC Disease Activity Index and in pouchitis using the Pouchitis Disease Activity Index. Metabolite profiles were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of metabolites identified in HC (54) was significantly higher than in patients with CD (44, p<0.001), UC (47, p=0.042) and pouchitis (43, p=0.036). Multivariate discriminant analysis predicted HC, CD, UC and pouchitis group membership with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs: pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate and nonanoate), and of some protein fermentation metabolites, were significantly decreased in patients with CD, UC and pouchitis. Hexanoate levels were inversely correlated to disease activity in CD (correlation coefficient=-0.157, p=0.046), whereas a significant positive correlation was found between styrene levels and disease activity in UC (correlation coefficient=0.338, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Faecal metabolic profiling in patients with IBD relative to healthy controls identified MCFAs as important metabolic biomarkers of disease-related changes.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The presentation of Crohn's disease (CD) is heterogeneous and often leads to serious complications and need for surgery. We tested serum anti-zymogen granule glycoprotein 2 (GP2) antibodies, including its novel isoform alpha, for association with genetic variants, diagnosis, disease stratification, and prediction of CD courses in a combined cross-sectional and cohort study. METHODS: Serum samples of 303 CD, 108 ulcerative colitis, 72 other inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases, and 206 controls without predominant gastrointestinal diseases controls (HC) were tested for the presence of Anti-GP2 and Anti-Saccharomyces cervisiae (ASCA) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genetic analysis was performed using the Illumina Immunochip. RESULTS: GP2 IgA and IgG had the highest discriminatory capability for CD versus ulcerative colitis and CD versus inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases. We identified an association of GP2 IgA and IgG each with 5 distinct single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Levels of anti-GP2 IgG were moderately associated with ileal disease location. Interestingly, both, anti-GP2 IgA and IgG were exclusively associated with the occurrence of stenosis and need for surgery, independently of disease location, but not with fistulizing CD, early disease onset or disease activity. ASCA IgG and IgA were qualitatively and quantitatively linked to CD, CD complications, and need for surgery. Increased levels of ASCA IgG and IgA and positivity for ASCA IgG, but neither levels nor positivity for GP2 IgG or IgA were predictive of the earlier occurrence of complications or surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-GP2 antibodies may aid as a tool for diagnosis and differentiation of CD and could indicate a more complicated CD course.},

A total of 25 studies were located with 12 focusing on body weight and diet quality. There was emerging evidence suggestive of benefits for body weight, improved markers of metabolic health, blood pressure, and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. SVD may also have a role to play in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease. Given that there is a higher tendency for females to be flexitarian yet males are more likely to overconsume meat, there is a clear need to communicate the potential health benefits of these diets to males.},

RESULTS: Twenty-eight children with CF (mean [standard deviation (SD)] 8.4 [3.3] years old, 22 pancreatic insufficient [PI]), 47 HC, and 30 CD were recruited. Mean (SD) faecal calprotectin in CF (94.3 [100.6] mg/kg) was greater than HC (26.7 [15.4] mg/kg, P < 0.0001), but lower than CD (2133 [2781] mg/kg, P = 0.0003). Abnormal faecal calprotectin was found in subjects only with PI (17/22 (77%), P = 0.001). There was no difference in faecal mean (SD) S100A12 (0.8 [0.9] vs 1.5 [2.2] mg/kg, P = 0.14) and osteoprotegerin concentrations (72.7 [52.2] vs 62.5 [0.0] pg/mL, P = 0.2) between CF and HC. Patients with CD had significantly elevated S100A12 and osteoprotegerin compared with CF and HC. Faecal calprotectin inversely correlated with both weight (r = -0.5, P = 0.003) and height z scores (r = -0.6, P = 0.002) in CF. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of intestinal inflammation in CF is unique and distinct from inflammatory bowel disease, with elevated faecal calprotectin but normal faecal S100A12 and osteoprotegerin concentrations. The severity of intestinal inflammation, based on faecal calprotectin, significantly correlates with poor growth.},

   abstract = {Thalidomide has anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenetic activity that makes it suitable for treating inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The recent guidelines from the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization/European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition conclude that thalidomide cannot be recommended in refractory pediatric Crohn's disease but that it may be considered in selected cohorts of patients who are not anti-TNFalpha agent responders. The main adverse effect is the potential teratogenicity that renders the long-term use of thalidomide problematic in young adults due to the strict need for contraceptive use. In short-term use it is relatively safe; the most likely adverse effect is the neuropathy, which is highly reversible in children. So far the use of thalidomide is reported in 223 adult and pediatric IBD patients (206 with Crohn's disease). In the following sections, the authors will discuss efficacy and safety of thalidomide, in the short-term treatment of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is the mainstay of treatment for patients with Type 3 intestinal failure (IF), however long term data on mortality and nutritional outcomes are limited. OBJECTIVES: To assess the long-term survival and requirements for ongoing HPN in patients receiving treatment at a UK national referral centre for intestinal failure. METHODS: Patients with IF who received HPN for more than 3 months at this Intestinal Failure Unit between 1978 and 2011 had their clinical records reviewed. SPSS 20 was utilised to perform Cox regression analysis and generate Kaplan Meier curves, with the aim of identifying factors associated with death and the continued need for HPN. RESULTS: Case notes from 545 patients were reviewed. Overall survival (OS) in patients without malignancy at commencement of IF was 93%, 71%, 59% and 28% at 1, 5, 10 and 20 years after starting treatment. Crohn's disease, mesenteric ischaemia and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction were associated with a better OS than scleroderma and radiation enteritis on multivariate analysis. Older age at onset of IF was associated with poor OS, while shorter small bowel length or central line sepsis was not. 15% (25/170) of deaths were due to complications of HPN (central line sepsis = 10, IF-associated liver disease = 15). Continued HPN dependence in survivors was 83%, 63%, 59% and 53% at 1, 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively. Among the 153 patients without malignancy who achieved nutritional independence from HPN, 77 (50.3%) did so after surgical reconstruction of the alimentary tract (HPN duration mean 19 months, range 3-126 months). 76 patients (49.7%) weaned from HPN without undergoing surgical reconstruction. CONCLUSION: This is the largest reported data set on long-term survival and dependence on HPN and will inform the indications, benefits and risks of treatment in disease specific groups. A significant proportion of patients achieved nutritional autonomy without surgical intervention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A large proportion (25-46%) of adults with inflammatory bowel disease in remission has symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which are thought to reflect ongoing inflammation. Data on paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients are lacking. AIM: To investigate (i) the prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients in remission and (ii) the relationship of IBS-type symptoms with biochemical markers of disease activity. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included all patients (<18 years) with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis attending the out-patient clinic of one of three Dutch hospitals between March 2014 and June 2015. Clinical disease activity was determined using the abbreviated-PCDAI or PUCAI. Biochemical disease activity was assessed using faecal calprotectin and serum CRP. IBS-symptoms were assessed using physician-administered Rome III-questionnaires. RESULTS: We included 184 patients (92 female; mean age: 14.5 years) (Crohn's disease: 123, ulcerative colitis: 61). The prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children with inflammatory bowel disease in clinical remission was 6.4% (95% CI: 2.5-11.1%; Crohn's disease: 4.5%; ulcerative colitis: 10.8%). Prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children with faecal calprotectin <250 mug/g was 16.1% (95% CI: 7.6-25.8%; Crohn's disease: 16.7%; ulcerative colitis: 10.8%). No difference in faecal calprotectin or CRP was found between patients in clinical remission with or without IBS-type symptoms (faecal calprotectin: IBS+ median 58 mug/g, IBS- 221 mug/g, P = 0.12; CRP: IBS+ median 1.4 mg/L, IBS- 1.1 mg/L, P = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children with inflammatory bowel disease is highly dependent on the definition of remission. Nonetheless, the prevalence is much lower than that previously reported in studies in adult inflammatory bowel disease patients. IBS-type symptoms appear to be unrelated to gastrointestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Anti-TNF-alpha treatment constitutes a mainstay in the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD), but its mechanisms of action are not fully understood. We aimed to investigate the effects of adalimumab, a human monoclonal TNF-alpha antibody, on macrophage (MQ) and dendritic cell (DC) subsets in mucosal biopsies and peripheral blood. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Intestinal biopsies and blood samples were obtained from 12 different CD patients both before and 4 weeks after the initiation of the induction of adalimumab treatment. Endoscopic disease activity was estimated by the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease. Biopsies were obtained from inflamed and non-inflamed areas. The numbers of lamina propria CD14 (+) DR(int) and CD14 (+) DR(hi) MQs, CD141(+), CD141(-) and CD103(+) DCs subsets, and circulating monocytes and DCs were analyzed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: At baseline, we observed higher numbers of DR(int) MQs and lower numbers of CD103(+) DCs in inflamed versus non-inflamed mucosa [843 vs. 391/10(5) lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) (p < 0.05) and 9 vs. 19 x 10(5) LPMCs (p = 0.01), respectively]. After four weeks of adalimumab treatment, the numbers of DR(int) MQs decreased [843 to 379/10(5) LPMCs (p = 0.03)], whereas the numbers of CD103(+) DCs increased [9-20 x 10(5) LPMCs (p = 0.003)] compared with baseline. In peripheral blood, no alterations were observed in monocyte or DC numbers between baseline and week 4. CONCLUSIONS: In CD, mucosal inflammation is associated with high numbers of DR(int) MQs and low numbers of CD103(+) DCs. This composition of intestinal myeloid subsets is reversed by anti-TNF-alpha treatment. These results suggest that DR(int) MQs play a pivotal role in CD inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intra-abdominal abscesses (IAA) are complications of Crohn's disease, which often result in hospitalization, surgery, and increased cost. Initial management may include medical therapy, percutaneous drainage (PD), or surgery, although the optimal management of IAA in children is unclear. METHODS: Retrospective review of all pediatric patients with Crohn's disease who developed an IAA from January 1, 2000 to April 30, 2012. Three groups, based on initial IAA treatment modality (medical, PD, and surgery), were compared. RESULTS: Thirty cases of IAA were identified (mean age at IAA diagnosis, 15.4 +/- 2.6 yr, 67% female, median Crohn's disease duration, 2.6 mo). Computed tomography was the most common initial (93%) and follow-up (47%) imaging. The average time to follow-up imaging was 8.5 days. For initial management, 18 received medical therapy, 10 PD, and 2 had surgery. The medical therapy group received more computed tomography scans for follow-up imaging than the PD group (12 [67%] versus 2 [20%], P = 0.046). There were no significant differences in abscess characteristics or management of posttreatment course between these 2 groups. Surgical resection occurred in 3 patients (17%) in the medical group and 2 (20%) in the PD group during index hospitalization. No significant differences were identified among treatment groups for readmissions, complications, or abscess recurrence. By 1 year, 12 of the 18 medically managed patients (67%) had surgery, and 6 of the 10 patients (60%) treated with initial PD ultimately had surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with IAA require definitive surgical treatment, and there were no clear predictors of those who did not.},

The objective was to identify whether sex differences exist with respect to complications, procedures, and medication usage (corticosteroids, biological agents, and total parenteral nutrition) among hospitalized adolescents with CD. METHODS: Adolescents with CD (n = 5782) hospitalized between April 1, 2004, and June 30, 2012, were selected from the Pediatric Health Information System database with a 1:1 ratio of males to females by hospital. Frequency of disease complications, associated conditions, procedures performed, and medication usage were analyzed with nonparametric statistical tests for the existence of sex differences. RESULTS: Five thousand seven hundred eighty-two patients were included with a median age of 15 years. Females were slightly more likely to have anemia (29% versus 25%, P = 0.012), infection (12% versus 8%, P = 0.001), and mood disorder (9% versus 6%, P < 0.001), whereas males had more maturational delays (3% versus 1%, P = 0.004) and malnutrition (18% versus 14%, P = 0.027). Among procedures, only one category demonstrated a sex difference: females had more blood product transfusions (9% versus 6%, P < 0.001). Female rates for corticosteroids (62%), biological agents (16%), and total parenteral nutritionTPN (18%) were not statistically different from those for males (62%, 15%, and 20%, respectively). There were no differences in length of stay by sex. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study of an administrative database identified few sex differences among adolescents with CD. The effect sizes were universally small and generally consistent with known sex differences unrelated to IBD.},

The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition cosponsored a needs assessment survey of pediatric gastroenterology trainees and program directors (PDs) to inform on educational programming. METHODS: A Web-based, self-completed survey was provided to North American trainees and PDs during the 2013-2014 academic year. Standard descriptive statistics summarized demographics and responses. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-six of 326 (51%) trainees (62% female) and 37 of 74 (50%) PDs responded. Median trainees per program = 5 and median total faculty = 10 (3 IBD experts); 15% of programs did not have a self-identified "IBD expert" faculty member. Sixty-nine percent of trainees were confident/somewhat confident in their IBD inpatient training, whereas 54% were confident/somewhat confident in their outpatient training. Trainees identified activities that would most improve their education, including didactics (55%), interaction with national experts (50%), trainee-centered IBD Web resources (42%), and increased patient exposure (42%). Trainees were most confident in managing inpatient active Crohn's disease/ulcerative colitis, phenotype classification, managing biological therapies, and using clinical disease activity indices. They were least confident in managing J-pouch complications, performing pouchoscopy, managing extraintestinal manifestations, and ostomy-related complications. Eighty-five percent would like an IBD-focused training elective. Most directors (86%) would allow trainees to do electives at other institutions. CONCLUSIONS: This IBD needs assessment survey of pediatric gastroenterology trainees and PDs demonstrated a strong resource commitment to IBD training and clinical care. Areas for educational enrichment emerged, including pouch and ostomy complications.},

METHODS: Data were extracted from the Pediatric Health Information System (January 1, 2004-June 30, 2012) for patients with 21 years or younger hospitalized with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. White and black cohorts were randomly selected in a 2:1 ratio by hospital. The primary outcome was time from index hospital discharge to readmission.

Black children had a shorter time to first readmission and higher probability of readmission (P = 0.009) and a 16% increase in risk of readmission compared with white children (P = 0.01). Black children had longer length of stay and higher frequency of overall and late (30-d to 12-mo postdischarge) readmissions (P < 0.001). During index hospitalization, more black children had perianal disease and anemia (P < 0.001). During any hospitalization, black children had higher incidence of perianal disease, anemia, and vitamin D deficiency, and greater number of perianal procedures, endoscopies, and blood product transfusion (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There are differences in hospital readmissions, complications, and procedures among hospitalized children related to race. It is unclear whether these differences are due to genetic differences, worse intrinsic disease, adherence, access to treatment, or treatment disparities.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: De novo Crohn's disease (CD) of the neo-small intestine in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients after total proctocolectomy (TPC) is a new disease entity, which may persist even after a secondary diverting permanent ileostomy for pouch failure. We sought to compare outcomes of primary ileostomy (PI, i.e., stoma created after colectomy without trying of ileal pouch) and secondary ileostomy (SI, i.e., stoma created after pouch failure) and to evaluate factors associated with the development of CD of the neo-small intestine proximal to ileostomy. METHODS: A total of 123 eligible patients were identified from our Pouch Center Registry (PI group, n = 57 and SI group, n = 66). Demographics, clinical features and outcomes (CD of theneo-small intestine, non-CD related strictures, requirement of CD-related medications use, ileostomy-associated hospitalization, ileostomy failure with stoma revision/relocation, and shortgut syndrome) were compared. Step-wise logistic regression models were performed. RESULTS: The median follow-up for the whole cohort was 5.0 (2.0-12.0) years. Younger age at diagnosis and surgery, family history of IBD, toxic megacolon/fulminant colitis, pre-diversion severe diarrhea, prediversion anti-TNF biological therapy, arthralgia/arthropathy and staged surgery were more common in the SI group (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, the presence of SI [odds ratio (OR), 8.23; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.43-27.85], family history of IBD (OR, 9.14; 95% CI, 3.13-26.69), and pre-diversion of weight loss (OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.23-11.21) were contributing factors for developing CD of the neo-small intestine. CONCLUSIONS: CD of the neo-small intestine in stoma patients was associated with the presence of SI, family history of IBD, and pre-diversion poor nutrition status. Patients with secondary ileostomy due to pouch failure should be carefully monitored. Aggressive medical, endoscopic or surgical therapy may be needed in patients at risk, before permanent diversion.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The efficacy of adalimumab in inducing and maintaining remission in children with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease was shown in the IMAgINE 1 trial (NCT00409682). As per protocol, nonresponders or patients experiencing flare(s) on every other week (EOW) maintenance dosing could escalate to weekly dosing; we aimed to determine the therapeutic benefits of weekly dose escalation in this subpopulation. METHODS: Week 52 remission and response rates were assessed in patients who escalated to weekly dosing from their previous EOW schedule, which was according to randomized treatment dose (higher dose [HD] adalimumab [>/=40 kg, 40 mg EOW; <40 kg, 20 mg EOW] or lower dose [LD; >/=40 kg, 20 mg EOW; <40 kg, 10 mg EOW]). Adverse events were reported for patients remaining on EOW dosing and patients receiving weekly dosing. RESULTS: Escalation to weekly dosing occurred in 48/95 (50.5%) patients randomized to LD and 35/93 (37.6%) patients randomized to HD adalimumab (P = 0.076). Week 52 remission and response rates were 18.8% and 47.9% for patients receiving LD adalimumab weekly and 31.4% and 57.1% for patients receiving HD adalimumab weekly, respectively (LD versus HD, P = 0.19 for remission; P = 0.41 for response). Adverse event rates were similar for patients receiving EOW and weekly adalimumab. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly adalimumab dosing was clinically beneficial for children with Crohn's disease who experienced nonresponse or flare on EOW dosing. No increased safety risks were observed with weekly dosing.},

We aimed to (1) determine the frequency of temporary (TGI) and permanent (PGI) growth impairment in children administered steroids and (2) examine whether cumulative steroid administration was associated with TGI and/or PGI. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in patients with Crohn's disease (<18 yr) administered steroids at the gastroenterology clinics of Sainte-Justine Hospital, Montreal. Steroid dosage, height during follow-up, adult height (after age 20), and parental heights were ascertained. Patients with height z score <-1.64 on more than 1 occasion before age 18 were considered as patients with TGI. Patients with adult heights <8.5 cm below the expected target heights were considered as patients with PGI. Association between steroid dosage and TGI/PGI was studied using logistic regression analyses. Data from the Swiss IBD Cohort Study were analyzed for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 221 children were studied. Approximately 19% (42/221) children were deemed as TGI, and 8/137 patients (5.8%) had PGI. TGI was associated with diagnosis at younger age (P value 0.002) and steroid administration at younger age (P value 0.001), but not with steroid dosage. Final adult height was associated with target height, but not with cumulative steroid dosage. Rates of PGI in the Swiss cohort were approximately 9.1% in steroid users and 2.7% in nonusers. CONCLUSIONS: Most children with TGI attain normal adult heights. Cumulative steroid use does not seem to be associated with either TGI or PGI in children with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Studies have shown tumorigenetic and histomorphological differences between IBD-associated CRC and non-IBD CRC, suggesting differences in tumor behavior and response to treatment. We aimed to compare tumor recurrence and survival rates following postoperative chemotherapy in CRC patients with and without IBD. METHODS: Search of the Cleveland Clinic's CRC database revealed 65 patients who had IBD-associated CRC and received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy between 1994 and 2010. Twenty-one patients were excluded due to incomplete clinical data. Propensity score-matching based on age, surgery intent, CRC site, tumor grade, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage and T stage was used to match IBD and non-IBD patients (1:4). Competing risk and Cox regression models were used to analyze differences in disease-free survival and overall survival, respectively. RESULTS: Forty-four patients with IBD-associated CRC were matched to 176 patients with non-IBD CRC. Among IBD patients, 29 (66%) had ulcerative colitis, 14 (32%) had Crohn's disease, and one (2%) had indeterminate colitis. Mean IBD diagnosis age was 28.1 +/- 14.5 years, and mean IBD duration at time of CRC treatment was 21.5 +/- 12.6 years. Ten (23%) IBD patients had tumor recurrence compared with 34 (19%) non-IBD patients (P = .074). There was no significant difference in disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.35-1.05; P = 0.074) or overall survival (HR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.54-1.4; P = 0.58) between IBD and non-IBD patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with IBD-associated CRC have comparable rates of tumor recurrence and survival following postoperative chemotherapy as CRC patients without IBD. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and guide therapeutic decisions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a first-line therapy in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) thought to induce remission through changes in the gut microbiome. With microbiome assessment largely focused on microbial taxonomy and diversity, it remains unclear to what extent EEN induces functional changes that thereby contribute to its therapeutic effect. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 15 pediatric CD patients prior to and after EEN treatment, as well as from 5 healthy controls. Metagenomic data were obtained via next-generation sequencing, and nonhuman reads were mapped to KEGG pathways, where possible. Pathway abundance was compared between CD patients and controls, and between CD patients that sustained remission (SR) and those that did not sustain remission (NSR). RESULTS: Of 132 KEGG pathways identified, 8 pathways differed significantly between baseline CD patients and controls. Examination of these eight pathways showed SR patients had greater similarity to controls than NSR patients in all cases. Pathways fell into one of three groups: 1) no prior connection to IBD, 2) previously reported connection to IBD, and 3) known roles in innate immunity and immunoregulation. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota of CD patients and controls represent alternative ecological states that have broad differences in functional capabilities, including xenobiotic and environmental pollutant degradation, succinate metavolism, and bacterial HtpG, all of which can affect barrier integrity and immune regulation. Moreover, our finding that SR patients were more similar to healthy controls suggests that community microbial function, as inferred from fecal microbiomes, could serve as a valuable diagnostic tool.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical remission achieved by exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is associated with marked microbiome changes. In this prospective study of exclusive enteral nutrition, we employ a hierarchical model of microbial community structure to distinguish between pediatric Crohn's disease patients who achieved sustained remission (SR) and those who relapsed early (non-SR), after restarting a normal diet. METHODS: Fecal samples were obtained from 10 patients (age 10-16) and from 5 healthy controls (age 9-14). The microbiota was assessed via 16S rRNA sequencing. In addition to standard measures of microbial biodiversity, we employed Bayesian methods to characterize the hierarchical community structure. Community structure between patients who sustained remission (wPCDAI <12.5) up to their 24-week follow-up (SR) was compared with patients that had not sustained remission (non-SR). RESULTS: Microbial diversity was lower in Crohn's disease patients relative to controls and lowest in patients who did not achieve SR. SR patients differed from non-SR patients in terms of the structure and prevalence of their microbial communities. The SR prevalent community contained a number of strains of Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides and was limited in Proteobacteria, whereas the non-SR prevalent community had a large Proteobacteria component. Their communities were so different that a model trained to discriminate SR and non-SR had 80% classification accuracy, already at baseline sampling. CONCLUSIONS: Microbial community structure differs between healthy controls, patients who have an enduring response to exclusive enteral nutrition, and those who relapse early on introduction of normal diet. Our novel Bayesian approach to these differences is able to predict sustained remission after exclusive enteral nutrition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Loss of response to infliximab resulting in discontinuation of therapy is a frequent problem encountered in paediatric Crohn's disease. Although identifying patients at risk of failure could have important implications for follow-up, literature in this area remains sparse. Our primary aim was to identify predictors of loss of response to infliximab among patients who were responders to induction. The secondary aim was to identify predictors of non-response to induction. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of patients with paediatric Crohn's disease treated with infliximab between 2000 and 2013 was followed until loss of response to infliximab or transfer to adult care. Predictors of response to induction therapy were studied by multivariate logistic regression. Time to treatment failure was analysed with a multivariate Cox model. RESULTS: Two-hundred and forty-eight patients were eligible for the study. Of these, 196 (79%) were responders to induction (57% clinical remission and 22% clinical response) and 52 (21%) were non-responders. Steroid resistance was the only variable independently associated with primary non-response (odds ratio [OR] 4.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67-12.50, p = 0.002). Thirty-one of the 196 responders discontinued infliximab due to loss of response after a mean of 1.6+/-1.3 years of treatment. Predictors of loss of response were level of response to induction (clinical response vs clinical remission, hazard ratio [HR] 3.74, 95% CI 1.80-7.80, p = 0.0004) and isolated colonic disease (HR 2.72, 95% CI 1.30-5.71, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who fail to achieve clinical remission after induction and/or who have isolated colonic disease are at increased risk of loss of response to infliximab.},

   abstract = {Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC). Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.},

   abstract = {Numerous environmental factors have been linked with inflammatory bowel disease. These include smoking, diet, hygiene, drugs, geographical and psychosocial factors. These factors may either increase the risk of or protect against developing this condition and can also affect the course of illness in a positive or negative manner. A number of studies have examined the influence of environmental factors on inflammatory bowel diseases as a whole as well as on ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease separately. As there are differences in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the effect of environmental factors on their onset and course is not always similar. Some factors have shown a consistent association, while reports on others have been conflicting. In this article we discuss the current evidence on the roles of these factors on inflammatory bowel disease, both as causative/protective agents and as modifiers of disease course.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is a useful tool in assessing the transmural and extraintestinal lesions in Crohn's disease (CD). However, the influence of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy on MRE features of CD severity remains unknown. The purpose of the study was to assess the short- and long-term changes in MRE features of CD activity in relation to CD clinical course in patients treated with anti-TNF antibodies. METHODS: The influence on the most important parameters of CD activity seen in MRE was assessed retrospectively using a validated score. Patients were treated with anti-TNF agents and the clinical, laboratory, and MRE CD activity was estimated at baseline, after the induction therapy and after 1 year of treatment. RESULTS: 71 patients were enrolled in a study. The change in CD clinical activity correlated significantly with fluctuations in MRE activity score (P < 0.0001, r = 0.5 for induction; P = 0.004, r = 0.7 for maintenance anti-TNF therapy, respectively). Bowel wall thickening, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and fat wrapping with vascular proliferation were MRE parameters which changed significantly both after the induction and maintenance treatment in patients responding to the therapy. The change in MRE activity score was mostly pronounced during the first 3 months of treatment, when compared to the continuation of the therapy till week 52-54 (-6 points vs. -2 points, respectively; P = 0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: Transmural and extraintestinal healing seen in MRE correlates with changes in CD clinical activity during anti-TNF therapy, thus MRE seems to be a useful tool in monitoring the efficacy of biological agents.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Soluble tumour necrosis factor-alpha (sTNF-alpha) has been reported to increase in the course of anti-TNF-alpha therapy for rheumatoid and skin diseases. AIMS: To assess changes in sTNF-alpha and clinical efficacy of anti-TNF-alpha agents in Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Sixty-four patients on infliximab or adalimumab were analyzed. Clinical outcomes were assessed by using CD Activity Index after the induction therapy and at week 52. sTNF-alpha was measured before and after the induction therapy with high-sensitivity immunoassay. RESULTS: In the majority of patients, sTNF-alpha increased significantly. Those with the greatest increase were more likely to experience long-term response, were more often treated with infliximab, had less frequently isolated small bowel CD, and tended to have sTNF-alpha levels at baseline that correlated with C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Neutralization of sTNF-alpha does not seem to be critical for the efficacy of anti-TNF-alpha therapy in CD. Paradoxically - an increase in sTNF-alpha may reflect an ongoing process that is beneficial for the clinical outcome.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Immune-mediated angiogenesis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lesions in Crohn's disease (CD). The study aimed to assess the influence of anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy on the angiogenesis in relation to microscopic and endoscopic healing in CD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Colonic tissue samples from 17 CD patients were taken during colonoscopy before and after anti-TNF therapy. Endoscopic and microscopic severities were estimated using validated scores. Immunohistochemical expression of CD31 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were assessed in parallel. RESULTS: The expression of CD31 and VEGF decreased significantly after the anti-TNF therapy in parallel to endoscopic improvement; however, the microscopic activity did not change significantly. There was a correlation between the change in CD31 and VEGF expression (p = 0.01; r = 0.6), as well as endoscopic healing (p = 0.04; r = 0.4). CD31 immunoexpression correlated with the number of poly- and mononuclear cells in the infiltrates in the mucosal lamina propria before the therapy (p = 0.02; r = 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that modulation of vascular proliferation can be a novel option to increase the efficacy of biological therapy in CD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Objective assessment of Crohn's disease (CD) activity in patients treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) antibodies is crucial for the prediction of its long-term results. Mucosal healing estimated endoscopically has a strong predictive value; however, only combined assessment together with transmural healing in magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) gives full information about the whole spectrum of inflammatory lesions in CD. AIM: To assess the usefulness of intestinal healing phenomenon in CD, defined as improvement both in endoscopy and MRE, after anti-TNF induction therapy, in predicting long-term results of 1-year treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients with ileocolonic CD were enrolled into the study. In this group a parallel assessment of disease activity was estimated before and after induction doses of anti-TNF antibodies with ileocolonoscopy and MRE by using appropriate scores. Subsequently the patients were treated until 12 months and then followed-up. The associations between intestinal healing (assessed in MRE and endoscopy), and mucosal and transmural healing with long-term results of 1-year anti-TNF therapy were analysed statistically. RESULTS: The median time of follow-up was 29 months (interquartile range - IQR: 14-46). Intestinal healing was significantly associated with favourable therapeutic outcomes (p = 0.02) and had 75% (IQR: 35-97%) sensitivity and 72% (IQR: 46-90%) specificity in predicting long-term remission. Other parameters were not useful (transmural healing) or their usefulness was of borderline significance (mucosal healing). CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic assessment of intestinal healing is an accurate method in predicting long-term outcomes in CD patients responding to 1-year anti-TNF therapy.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess the potential mechanisms providing resistance to apoptosis of lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) directlyin intestinal tissues from patients with Crohn's disease (CD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty CD patients were enrolled in the study. The control group consisted of healthy patients who underwent surveillance colonoscopy after endoscopic polypectomy. Each CD patient underwent colonoscopy with tissue sampling from inflamed areas of the colon with the assessment of immunohistochemical expression of active caspase 3, Fas, tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), Bcl-2, Bax, CD4 and CD8. This was compared with healthy intestinal mucosa. RESULTS: The expression of active caspase 3 was significantly lower in LPL in CD (0.4 +/-0.3 vs. 2.8 +/-1.5; p = 0.0002). A statistically significant increase of CD4 and CD8 positive cells was noted in CD (2.3 +/-0.5 vs. 1.2 +/-0.2, p < 0.0001; 2.1 +/-0.3 vs. 1.1 +/-0.3, p < 0.0001, respectively). It was associated with a significant increase of the Bcl-2 (6.7 +/-2.7 vs. 2.9 +/-0.8; p < 0.0001) and a decrease of the Bax protein expression (3.4 +/-2.1 vs. 5.5 +/-1.8; p < 0.0001) in CD. The expression of Fas and TNFR1 did not differ between the study groups. CONCLUSIONS: LPL in CD are resistant to apoptosis when compared with physiological conditions. This is probably due to an imbalance in Bcl-2 family proteins. TNFR1-related pathway is probably not involved in disturbances of LPL apoptosis in CD.},

We assessed which MRE features were predictive for steroid-free remission at week 52, and which were associated with a secondary loss of response. 44 patients were in steroid-free remission at week 52, 17--were secondary non-responders. The ROC curve showed that bowel thickening with contrast enhancement analyzed together at week 0 were associated with steroid-free remission at week 52 (p = 0.01; AUC 0.67). Bowel stenosis with or without prestenotic dilatation [OR 5.8 (95% CI 1.4-25) and 2.4 (95% CI 1.2 - 5) respectively; p = 0.01] and the presence of intra-abdominal fistulas [OR 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-2); p=0.004] were related to secondary non-response. A high baseline inflammatory activity detected by MRE predicts one-year response in CD after IFX/ADA.

   abstract = {AIM: To assess the prevalence of nutritional disorders in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: The data from a national cohort of children newly diagnosed with IBD between 2003 and 2012 were analyzed. The diagnosis of IBD and the differentiation between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) were confirmed by gastroenterologists according to the standard criteria. The body mass index (BMI) of each child [weight (kg)/height(2) (m)] was calculated at the time of diagnosis. The World Health Organization standards and references were used and the BMI for age > +1 and < -2 standard deviation score were used to define overweight and thinness, respectively. Age stratification analysis was performed to investigate any age-related variation in the prevalence of nutritional status between children < 10 years of age and older. RESULTS: There were 374 children from 0.33 to 17 years of age, including 119 (32%) children with UC and 255 (68%) with CD. All of the children were Saudi nationals, and 68 (57%) of the UC and 150 (59%) of the CD children were males. A positive history of anorexia at the time of diagnosis was found in 30 (25%) patients with UC and 99 (39%) patients with CD. The prevalence of thinness was 31%, 35% and 24% in children with IBD, CD and UC, respectively, with a significantly higher prevalence of thinness in children with CD than in children with UC (P = 0.037) only in the age group of 10-17 years (P = 0.030). The prevalence of overweight was 16 %, 15% and 20 % in the children with IBD, CD and UC, respectively, indicating a higher prevalence in UC that was statistically significant only in the age group of 10-17 years (P = 0.020). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of children with IBD presented with overweight instead of the classical underweight. Awareness of this finding is important for patient care.},

Using high-density genotype data from more than 86,000 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 244 independent multidisease signals, including 27 new genome-wide significant susceptibility loci and 3 unreported shared risk loci. Complex pleiotropy was supported when contrasting multidisease signals with expression data sets from human, rat and mouse together with epigenetic and expressed enhancer profiles. The comorbidities among the five immune diseases were best explained by biological pleiotropy rather than heterogeneity (a subgroup of cases genetically identical to those with another disease, possibly owing to diagnostic misclassification, molecular subtypes or excessive comorbidity). In particular, the strong comorbidity between primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease is likely the result of a unique disease, which is genetically distinct from classical inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Escherichia coli can be isolated from lamina propria macrophages in Crohn's disease (CD), and their intramacrophage persistence may provide a stimulus for inflammation. To further determine the contributions of macrophage dysfunction and E. coli pathogenicity to this, we aimed to compare in vitro functioning of macrophages from patients with CD and healthy controls (HC) in response to infection with CD-derived adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) and less pathogenic E. coli strains. METHODS: Monocyte-derived macrophages were cultured from patients with CD and HC. Intramacrophage survival of E. coli strains (CD-derived adherent-invasive [AI] and non-AI strains and laboratory strain K-12) was compared. Macrophage cytokine release (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFalpha], interleukin [IL]-23, IL-8 and IL-10) and monocyte phagoctyosis and respiratory burst function were measured after E. coli infection. For CD patients, laboratory data were correlated with clinical phenotype, use of immunomodulation, and CD risk alleles (NOD2, IL-23R, ATG16L1 and IRGM). RESULTS: Attenuated TNFalpha and IL-23 release from CD macrophages was found after infection with all E. coli strains. There was prolonged survival of CD-derived AIEC, CD-derived non-AIEC and E. coli K-12 in macrophages from CD patients compared to within those from HC. No abnormality of monocyte phagocytosis or respiratory burst function was detected in CD. Macrophage dysfunction in CD was not influenced by phenotype, use of immunomodulation or genotype. CONCLUSIONS: CD macrophage responses to infection with E. coli are deficient, regardless of clinical phenotype, CD genotype or E. coli pathogenicity. This suggests host immunodeficiency is an important contributor to intramacrophage E. coli persistence in CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abnormal handling of E. coli by lamina propria (LP) macrophages may contribute to Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis. We aimed to determine LP macrophage phenotypes in CD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and healthy controls (HC), and in CD, to compare macrophage phenotypes according to E. coli carriage. METHODS: Mucosal biopsies were taken from 35 patients with CD, 9 with UC and 18 HCs. Laser capture microdissection was used to isolate E. coli-laden and unladen LP macrophages from ileal or colonic biopsies. From these macrophages, mRNA was extracted and cytokine and activation marker expression measured using RT-qPCR. RESULTS: E. coli-laden LP macrophages were identified commonly in mucosal biopsies from CD patients (25/35, 71 %), rarely in UC (1/9, 11 %) and not at all in healthy controls (0/18). LP macrophage cytokine mRNA expression was greater in CD and UC than healthy controls. In CD, E. coli-laden macrophages expressed high IL-10 & CD163 and lower TNFalpha, IL-23 & iNOS irrespective of macroscopic inflammation. In inflamed tissue, E. coli-unladen macrophages expressed high TNFalpha, IL-23 & iNOS and lower IL-10 & CD163. In uninflamed tissue, unladen macrophages had low cytokine mRNA expression, closer to that of healthy controls. CONCLUSION: In CD, intra-macrophage E. coli are commonly found and LP macrophages express characteristic cytokine mRNA profiles according to E. coli carriage. Persistence of E. coli within LP macrophages may provide a stimulus for chronic inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The efficacy of enteral nutrition (EN) for maintaining remission in patients with inactive Crohn's disease (CD) is unclear. The aim of this article was to systematically identify, review, and critically appraise the evidence on efficacy of EN in maintaining medically induced remission in CD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Several databases were searched from inception to April 2015 for relevant citations of published randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized cohort studies. Two reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion and assessed study quality and risk of bias. The primary outcome was relapse rate in patients with inactive CD who have been in medically induced remission and subsequently started or maintained on EN. RESULTS: Twelve studies (1169 patients, including 95 children) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. As the included studies were significantly heterogeneous, a meta-analysis was not performed. Eleven studies showed that EN was either better than, or as effective as, the comparator in maintaining remission in patients with inactive CD. No major EN-related adverse events were reported. Only 1 adult randomized controlled trial (n = 51), with low risk of bias, compared EN with regular diet and found a relapse rate of 34% in the EN group versus 64% in the control group ( P < .01) after a mean follow-up of 11.9 months. CONCLUSIONS: EN is more effective than regular diet and as effective as some medications in maintaining remission for patients with inactive CD. Large, properly designed randomized controlled studies of sufficient duration are required to confirm this conclusion for EN versus individual medications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Altered body composition is frequently observed in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. AIMS: To investigate the nutritional status, and the effect of different therapeutic regimes in adult CD patients. METHODS: Fat free mass (FFM) and BIA-derived phase angle (PhA) were assessed in 45 CD patients, 22 on conventional therapy (CT) and 23 on maintenance therapy with infliximab (MT). Nutritional status was also assessed in 12 CD patients before and following the induction protocol with infliximab. BIA data of CD patients were compared with those of 20 healthy asymptomatic volunteers. In CD patients C Reactive Protein (CRP) and albuminaemia dosage were obtained. RESULTS: The mean values of PhA and of FFM were significantly lower in CT patients when compared with control group and MT patients. Following infliximab treatment FFM increased, although not significantly, while mean phase angle value significantly increased from 4.6+/-0.3 to 6.2+/-0.4 (p<0.05). CRP was significantly lower in MT patients compared to that in CT patients. CONCLUSION: CD patients on conventional therapy showed a lower FFM and a lower mean phase angle score compared to those on infliximab therapy. Following infliximab treatment the mean phase angle score normalized. PhA is a reliable nutritional indicator in IBD patients and could be considered as an additional tool for assessing response to treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The composition of the intestinal microbiota seems to be an important factor in determining the clinical outcome in children with short bowel syndrome (SBS). Alterations in the microbiota may result in serious complications such as small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SBBO) and intestinal mucosal inflammation that lead to prolonged parenteral nutrition (PN) dependency with subsequently increased risk of liver failure and sepsis. To date, there are no reported mappings of the intestinal microbiome in children with SBS. Here, we present the first report on the intestinal microbial community profile in children with SBS. FINDINGS: The study includes children diagnosed with SBS in the neonatal period. Healthy siblings served as controls. Fecal samples were collected, and microbial profiles were analyzed by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. We observed a pronounced microbial dysbiosis in children with SBS on PN treatment with an increased and totally dominating relative abundance of Enterobacteriacae in four out of five children compared to children with SBS weaned from PN and healthy siblings. CONCLUSIONS: The overall decreased bacterial diversity in children with SBS is consistent with intestinal microbiome mappings in inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants. Our findings indicate that intestinal dysbiosis in children with SBS is associated with prolonged PN dependency.},

   abstract = {The incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD), is increasing worldwide, especially in young children and adolescents. Although hospitalized patients are usually provided with enteral or parenteral support, continuing care typically requires a trial-and-error approach to suppressing symptoms and maintaining disease remission. Current nutritional advice does not differ from general population guidelines. International collaborative studies have revealed 163 distinct genetic loci affecting susceptibility to IBD, in some of which host-microbe interactions can be seen to play an important role. The nature of these loci enables a rationale for predicting nutritional requirements that may not be evident through standard therapeutic approaches. Certain recognized nutrients, such as vitamin D and long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, may be required at higher than anticipated levels. Various phytochemicals, not usually considered in the same class as classic nutrients, could play an important role. Prebiotics and probiotics may also be beneficial. Genomic approaches enable proof of principle of nutrient optimization rather than waiting for disease symptoms to appear and/or progress. We suggest a paradigm shift in diagnostic tools and nutritional therapy for CD, involving a systems biology approach for implementation.},

We have conducted a single-center, retrospective case series describing the unique clinical and histologic features of this IBD-like chronic intestinal inflammation following solid organ transplant. At our center, nine of 327 kidney or liver recipients developed de novo IBD following transplant (six liver, two kidney, one liver-kidney). Most children presented with prolonged hematochezia and diarrhea and were treated with aminosalicylates. At time of diagnosis, five were not currently using mycophenolate mofetil for transplant immunosuppression. Histologic and endoscopic findings at IBD diagnosis included inflammation, ulcerations, granulomas, and chronic colitis. Since diagnosis, no patients have required surgical intervention, or escalation to biologic therapy, nor developed stricturing or perianal disease. In this case series, de novo post-transplant IBD developed in 4% of pediatric liver and/or kidney recipients; however, it often does not fit the classic patterns of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.},

METHODS: Sixty patients were randomly selected from a cohort of patients studied at the Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinic at the University of California, San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital. Two physicians independently reviewed the electronic health records of the included patients to determine the Paris classification for each patient by adhering to present guidelines and then by including microscopic findings. RESULTS: Macroscopic and combined disease location classifications were discordant in 34 (56.6%), with no statistically significant differences between groups. Interobserver agreement was higher in the combined classification (kappa = 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.65-0.82) as opposed to when classification was limited to macroscopic findings (kappa = 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.40-0.58). When evaluating the proximal upper gastrointestinal tract (Paris L4a), the interobserver agreement was better in macroscopic compared with the combined classification. CONCLUSIONS: Disease extent classifications differed significantly when comparing isolated macroscopic findings (Paris classification) with the combined scheme that included microscopy. Further studies are needed to determine which scheme provides more accurate representation of disease extent.},

   abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an important health issue worldwide, accounting for the third place of cancer incidence. Chronic inflammation, as seen in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is the most important risk factor for developing CRC, as it favours neoplastic transformation by enhancing epithelial cell turnover in the colonic mucosa. Treatments for CRC need to be improved; currently they are not specific and have several secondary effects in patients. The main objective of this work was to evaluate a new therapeutic strategy against a colitis-related colorectal cancer in vivo and in vitro by targeting mTOR-signaling and lactate dehydrogenase A. Together, these mechanisms directly affect tumor energetics. In this study we evaluated a better and more efficient triple therapy against a chronic inflammation-associated CRC in vivo and in vitro. After the development of tumors, mice were treated intraperitoneally during a forty-day period with single drugs or different combinations of Metformin, Sodium Oxamate and Doxorubicin. Targeted inhibition of the mTOR pathway, lactate dehydrogenase A and the concurrent use of Doxorubicin (called in this work as triple therapy), leaded to a notable reduction in the number and size of tumors in mice, and, a significant pro-inflammatory cytokines reduction Besides, we showed that treated cells were induced to early autophagy, and apoptosis cell death. Our results represent a novel and robust therapeutic strategy for overcoming CRC by means of targeting central molecular pathways in cancer by the combination of Metformin, Oxamate, and Doxorubicin leading to a rapid tumor growth inhibition and a dramatic colorectal crypt restoration. Besides, drug combination resulted in a notable reduction of anti-inflammatory cytokines.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Transition readiness assessment has focused attention on adolescent knowledge and skills, but data-driven benchmarks have not been established. METHODS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ages 25 to 50 years, attending an outpatient gastroenterology clinic, were recruited to complete a voluntary, confidential survey asking patients to recall medications and potential side effects, and to rate their degree of independence performing health maintenance tasks. RESULTS: The 141 respondents (48% response rate) had mean age of 36 years with median disease duration of 11 years. They were 60% female, 54% had Crohn disease, and 23% were diagnosed before age 18. Nearly all patients were fully independent answering doctor's questions during the visit (93%) and scheduling office visits (92%). Excluding pharmacy pick up, full independence seen in only 57%, whereas 16% significantly delegated tasks. No differences by sex, disease type, medication class, age at disease onset, or disease duration were found across levels of self-management. Almost all (97%) respondents could recall medication name, whereas fewer were able to recall dose (63%) or frequency (65%). Side effect knowledge was poor; among 81 patients on a biologic or immunomodulator, only 17 (21%) cited cancer and 22 (27%) cited infection. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent IBD transition programs now have empirical data from the present study about adult benchmarks for independence in self-management skills. Further research can establish which skills correlate with medication adherence and active collaboration with the medical team. The present study also exposes important gaps in medication risk knowledge and may allow improved patient education for subgroups of adult patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {Mucosal healing has been a central issue in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for the last years, and has been proposed to be included as the new treatment goal in IBD. The molecular understanding of both the disruption and the healing of the intestinal epithelial cell lining and the mucosal barrier in IBD is complex and only partly understood. There is no general agreement on how to define healed mucosa, but there is a general acceptance that clinicians should use endoscopy and imaging technique in their assessments. Mucosal healing is an old concept that has been actualized in the present era of the highly effective biological agents. Randomized clinical studies with mucosal healing as end-point parameters have been reported, and early mucosal healing has been associated with low complication rates. We are waiting for documentation of whether treatment to healed mucosa can change the natural course of IBD. The concept of immunological remission has recently been introduced and can be the new treatment goal and one of several criteria for discontinuation of biological treatment in IBD. In conclusion, mucosal healing is a fairly novel concept and goal for biological treatment of IBD. There is a need for a standardization of its assessment and validation of the prognostic value.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sulforaphane has well established anti-cancer properties and more recently anti-inflammatory properties have also been determined. Sulforaphane has been shown to inhibit PRR-mediated pro-inflammatory signalling by either directly targeting the receptor or their downstream signalling molecules such as the transcription factor, NF-kappaB. These results raise the possibility that PRR-mediated inflammation could be suppressed by specific dietary bioactives. We examined whether sulforaphane could suppress NF-kappaB via the NOD2 pathway. METHODS: Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were stably transfected with NOD2 variants and the NF-kappaB reporter, pNifty2-SEAP. The cells were co-treated with sulforaphane and MDP and secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) production was determined. RESULTS: We found that sulforaphane was able to significantly suppress the ligand-induced NF-kappaB activity at physiologically relevant concentrations, achievable via the consumption of broccoli within the diet. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory role of sulforaphane is not restricted to LPS-induced inflammatory signalling. These data add to the growing evidence that PRR activation can be inhibited by specific phytochemicals and thus suggests that diet could be a way of controlling inflammation. This is particularly important for a disease like Crohn's disease where diet can play a key role in relieving or exacerbating symptoms.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Small bowel Crohn's disease can present with clinical challenges that are specific to its location. In this review, we address some of the areas that present particular problems in small bowel Crohn's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: A key issue specific to small bowel Crohn's disease relates to its diagnosis given that access to the small bowel is limited. Radiological advances, particularly in small bowel ultrasonography and MRI, as well as the introduction of capsule endoscopy and balloon enteroscopy are helping to address this. In addition, our ability to differentiate small bowel Crohn's disease from other causes of inflammation, such as tuberculosis, is improving on the basis of better understanding of the features that differentiate these conditions. It is also becoming apparent that jejunal Crohn's disease represents a distinct disease phenotype with potentially worse clinical outcomes. Finally, because it is a rare complication, our understanding of small bowel cancer associated with Crohn's disease remains limited. Recent publications are, however, starting to improve our knowledge of this condition. SUMMARY: Although small bowel Crohn's disease presents specific management issues not seen in patients with Crohn's disease elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract, our knowledge of how to manage these is improving.},

We studied a total of 38 active UC, 31 inactive UC, 17 active CD, and 13 inactive CD and 50 non-inflamed tissues as control group. Gene expression was measured by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein expression was evaluated in tissue by immunohistochemistry and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by flow cytometry. Higher levels of IL-35 was produced by intestinal regulatory B cells and circulating regulatory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in active vs. inactive disease or healthy donors (P<0.05). The IL-37 was conspicuously synthesized by circulating B cells, active natural killer cells and monocytes. These results suggest that down-regulation of inflammation in active IBD patients might be based on the increased expression of IL-35 and IL-37.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The ESPEN guideline presents a multidisciplinary focus on clinical nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODOLOGY: The guideline is based on extensive systematic review of the literature, but relies on expert opinion when objective data were lacking or inconclusive. The conclusions and 64 recommendations have been subject to full peer review and a Delphi process in which uniformly positive responses (agree or strongly agree) were required. RESULTS: IBD is increasingly common and potential dietary factors in its aetiology are briefly reviewed. Malnutrition is highly prevalent in IBD - especially in Crohn's disease. Increased energy and protein requirements are observed in some patients. The management of malnutrition in IBD is considered within the general context of support for malnourished patients. Treatment of iron deficiency (parenterally if necessary) is strongly recommended. Routine provision of a special diet in IBD is not however supported. Parenteral nutrition is indicated only when enteral nutrition has failed or is impossible. The recommended perioperative management of patients with IBD undergoing surgery accords with general ESPEN guidance for patients having abdominal surgery. Probiotics may be helpful in UC but not Crohn's disease. Primary therapy using nutrition to treat IBD is not supported in ulcerative colitis, but is moderately well supported in Crohn's disease, especially in children where the adverse consequences of steroid therapy are proportionally greater. However, exclusion diets are generally not recommended and there is little evidence to support any particular formula feed when nutritional regimens are constructed. CONCLUSIONS: Available objective data to guide nutritional support and primary nutritional therapy in IBD are presented as 64 recommendations, of which 9 are very strong recommendations (grade A), 22 are strong recommendations (grade B) and 12 are based only on sparse evidence (grade 0); 21 recommendations are good practice points (GPP).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) is used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (HR) to IFX are frequently reported. OBJECTIVES: We investigated immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated mechanisms underlying immediate HR to IFX. We also evaluated the clinical utility of allergological tests as well as the tolerability of IFX retreatment in these patients. METHODS: This was a prospective single-center study including IBD patients with previous immediate HR to IFX. Skin tests to IFX, including prick tests and intradermal tests, and measurement of anti-IFX IgE antibodies were performed at least 4 weeks after HR. In case of negative skin tests and absence of IgE antibodies, readministration of IFX was performed with a twice-reduced infusion rate. In case of positive tests or recurrence of HR during readministration of IFX, a 12-step desensitization or induction of tolerance protocol was proposed. RESULTS: A total of 24 IBD patients were included (Crohn's disease: n=20). Prick tests to IFX were all negative. Intradermal test was positive in one patient. Anti-IFX IgE antibodies were not detected in 21 patients and were detected in three patients (significant level in one patient and intermediate level in two patients). No relationship was observed between positive skin tests and the presence of anti-IFX IgE antibodies. Switch to adalimumab was well tolerated in 10/11 patients. The readministration of IFX was well tolerated in 4/11 patients. Desensitization to IFX was successful in three out of four patients. CONCLUSION: The vast majority of immediate HR to IFX is not IgE-mediated. Allergological tests are of poor clinical utility. Desensitization or induction of tolerance protocol may allow continuation of IFX therapy in IBD patients with a history of immediate HR.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Standard infliximab maintenance dosing of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks may be inadequate to consistently achieve sufficient drug exposure to minimize loss of response or treatment failure in pediatric Crohn disease (CD). We aimed to determine the predicted infliximab trough concentrations in children with CD during maintenance therapy and the percentage of patients achieving target trough concentration >3 mug/mL. METHODS: A Monte Carlo simulation analysis was constructed using a published population pharmacokinetic model based on data from 112 children in the REACH trial. We assessed maintenance dosing strategies of 5, 7.5, and 10 mg/kg at dosing intervals of every 4, 6, and 8 weeks for children that differed by age, weight, albumin level, and concomitant immunomodulator therapy. RESULTS: Based on the index case of a 10-year-old with CD receiving standard infliximab dosing with concomitant immunomodulator therapy, the median (interquartile range) simulated infliximab trough concentration at week 14 was 1.3 (0.5-2.7) mug/mL and 2.4 (1.0-4.8) mug/mL for albumin levels of 3 and 4 g/dL, respectively. Among 1000 simulated children in the model, trough concentration >3 mug/mL at week 14 was achieved 21% and 41% of the time for albumin levels of 3 and 4 g/dL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Standard infliximab maintenance dosing in children with CD is predicted to frequently result in inadequate exposure, especially when albumin levels are low. Optimized dosing strategies for individual patients are needed to achieve sufficient drug exposure during infliximab maintenance therapy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adalimumab (ADA) in children with Crohn disease (CD) who experienced infliximab (IFX) failure at the population level. METHODS: The present retrospective study included all of the children with CD from a pediatric-onset population-based cohort who received ADA before 18 years because of IFX failure or intolerance. Efficacy of ADA was evaluated using the physician's global assessment score, C-reactive protein and orosomucoid, and nutritional and growth indicators. RESULTS: A total of 27 children with CD received ADA. Median age at CD diagnosis and at ADA initiation was 11 years (Q1 = 9; Q3 = 12) and 15 years (12; 15), respectively. After a median follow-up of 16 (8; 26) months after ADA initiation, ADA had clinical benefit as measured by the physical global assessment score in 19 patients (70%). Cumulative probability of failure to ADA treatment was 38% at 6 months and 55% at 1 year. Eight patients had a primary failure (30%) and 5 of 19 (26%) a secondary failure to ADA. Furthermore, 11 patients (40%) experienced a total of 19 adverse effects. No serious adverse effects were observed and none resulted in ADA discontinuation. There was no significant change in growth and nutritional patterns during the study period, but we found a significant decrease in median C-reactive protein (15 mg/L [4; 44] vs 9 mg/L [3; 19]; P = 0.05) and orosomucoid (1.6 g/L [1.5; 2.6] vs 1.1 g/L [0.8; 1.9]; P = 0.001) from ADA initiation to maximal follow-up in patients responding to ADA. CONCLUSIONS: In the present population-based cohort of pediatric-onset CD with IFX failure, treatment with ADA was safe and effective in two-thirds of patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colonic strictures complicate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and often lead to surgical resection to prevent dysplasia or cancer. We assessed the frequency of dysplasia and cancer among IBD patients undergoing resection of a colorectal stricture. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Groupe d'etudes et therapeutiques des affections inflammatoires du tube digestif study. This was a nationwide retrospective study of 12,013 patients with IBD in France who underwent surgery for strictures at 16 centers from August 1992 through January 2014 (293 patients for a colonic stricture, 248 patients with Crohn's disease, 51% male, median age at stricture diagnosis of 38 years). Participants had no preoperative evidence of dysplasia or cancer. We collected clinical, endoscopic, surgical, and pathology data and information on outcomes. RESULTS: When patients were diagnosed with strictures, they had IBD for a median time of 8 years (3-14). The strictures were a median length of 6 cm (4-10) and caused symptoms in 70% of patients. Of patients with Crohn's disease, 3 (1%) were found to have low-grade dysplasia, 1 (0.4%) was found to have high-grade dysplasia, and 2 (0.8%) were found to have cancer. Of patients with ulcerative colitis, 1 (2%) had low-grade dysplasia, 1 (2%) had high-grade dysplasia, and 2 (5%) had cancer. All patients with dysplasia or cancer received curative surgery, except 1 who died of colorectal cancer during the follow-up period. No active disease at time of surgery was the only factor associated with dysplasia or cancer at the stricture site (odds ratio, 4.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-21.27; P = .036). CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective study of patients with IBD undergoing surgery for colonic strictures, 3.5% were found to have dysplasia or cancer. These findings can be used to guide management of patients with IBD and colonic strictures.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the frequency of and risk factors for early (30-day) postoperative complications after ileocecal resection in a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Crohn's disease patients. METHODS: The REMIND group performed a nationwide study in 9 French university medical centers. Clinical-, biological-, surgical-, and treatment-related data on the 3 months before surgery were collected prospectively. Patients operated on between 1 September 2010 and 30 August 2014 were included. RESULTS: A total of 209 patients were included. The indication for ileocecal resection was stricturing disease in 109 (52%) cases, penetrating complications in 88 (42%), and medication-refractory inflammatory disease in 12 (6%). A two-stage procedure was performed in 33 (16%) patients. There were no postoperative deaths. Forty-three (21%) patients (23% of the patients with a one-stage procedure vs. 9% of those with a two-stage procedure, P=0.28) experienced a total of 54 early postoperative complications after a median time interval of 5 days (interquartile range, 4-12): intra-abdominal septic complications (n=38), extra-intestinal infections (n=10), and hemorrhage (n=6). Eighteen complications (33%) were severe (Dindo-Clavien III-IV). Reoperation was necessary in 14 (7%) patients, and secondary stomy was performed in 8 (4.5%). In a multivariate analysis, corticosteroid treatment in the 4 weeks before surgery was significantly associated with an elevated postoperative complication rate (odds ratio (95% confidence interval)=2.69 (1.15-6.29); P=0.022). Neither preoperative exposure to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents (n=93, 44%) nor trough serum anti-TNF levels were significant risk factors for postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, nationwide, prospective cohort, postoperative complications were observed after 21% of the ileocecal resections. Corticosteroid treatment in the 4 weeks before surgery was significantly associated with an elevated postoperative complication rate. In contrast, preoperative anti-TNF therapy (regardless of the serum level or the time interval between last administration and surgery) was not associated with an elevated risk of postoperative complications.},

The diagnosis is based on determination of fecal alpha-1 antitripsin clearance and stool analysis. Prognosis depends upon the patient and the disease location, severity and complication. Treatment is directed at control of the underlying IBDs but also includes albumin infusion in the most severe cases of hypoalbuminemia and fluid retention, dietary modifications for recovery and maintenance of nutritional status and supportive care to prevent further complication like deep venous thrombosis. Surgery is not curative in Crohn's disease patients, but in severe protein-loosing enteropathy with severe disease, not responding to conventional therapy, it may be the best choice.},

This is an observational and cross-sectional study. Fifty-four patients with IBD were studied: 27 active UC, 12 inactive UC, 10 active CD, and 5 inactive CD. All patients belonged to the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinic at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion. We found that IL-27 gene expression was significantly higher in active UC versus inactive UC group (P = 0.015). The IL-27 mRNA expression was increased in patients with active CD compared with inactive CD disease (P = 0.035). The percentage of IL-27 immunoreactive cells was higher in active UC versus active CD patients and non-inflamed tissue controls. The IL-27 was significantly elevated in active UC and CD patients, and it was associated with disease severity.},

   abstract = {Colitis-associated colorectal neoplasia (CRN) is a well-known complication of chronic inflammation of the colon either with ulcerative colitis (UC) or colonic Crohn's disease (CD). Studies have shown that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients have an overall higher risk for colorectal dysplasia and cancer compared to the general population and this risk is further increased by certain associated factors, including extent of disease, duration of disease, and age at onset. In addition, other risk factors not related to IBD can also further increase the risk for CRN, such as a family history of sporadic colon cancer and a concomitant diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. The society guidelines mostly agree on the appropriate time to begin CRN surveillance but vary somewhat on the appropriate intervals between surveillance colonoscopies. In addition, there is not yet a consensus on the appropriate method for surveillance. In this review, we discuss the risk for CRN in colonic IBD, the associated factors that further increase the risk for CRN, the current surveillance guidelines and the current methods available for CRN surveillance.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of depression is high in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). We examined the influence of affective-cognitive symptoms of depression on the risk of exacerbation of CD. METHODS: We studied 2,144 adult volunteers with a self-reported diagnosis of CD who completed a baseline survey that included demographics, CD status, and an affective-cognitive index of depression. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to determine whether CD status at 12 months was associated with the baseline measure of depression. Analyses were adjusted for confounders including age, gender, race, baseline disease activity, disease duration, prior hospitalization and surgery, corticosteroid and anti-TNF use, medication adherence, body mass index, current smoking, education, and sleep quality. RESULTS: Depression was significantly associated with subsequent increases in SCDAI score in both unadjusted (P<0.001) and adjusted (P<0.001) analyses. This association was non-linear, with a shallower slope for lower levels of depression. A 10-point increase in depression t-scores from 55 to 65 was associated with a 18.6-point increase in SCDAI (95% CI 11.5-25.6) and an odds ratio of 1.27 for SCDAI>150 at follow-up (CI: 1.01-1.60). We also found a significant association between depressive symptoms and hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were significantly associated with a risk of exacerbation of CD and hospitalization.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, debilitating condition with high emergency department (ED) utilization. We aimed to investigate the utilization patterns of ED by IBD patients and measure hospitalization and surgical rates following ED visits. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of adults with IBD listed as the primary ED diagnosis from the 2009 to 2011 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. The characteristics of the IBD-related ED visits in relation to following hospitalizations and surgeries were analyzed. RESULTS: Adult IBD patients constitute 0.09 % of the total ED visits. Crohn's disease (CD) contributed to 69 % of the IBD-ED visits. The hospitalization rate from ED was 59.9 % nationally, ranging from 56 % in west to 69 % in northeast. The most significant factors associated with hospitalization were intra-abdominal abscess [odds ratio (OR) 24.22], bowel obstruction (OR 17.77), anemia (OR 7.54), malnutrition (OR 6.29), hypovolemia/electrolyte abnormalities (OR 5.57), and fever/abnormal white cell count (OR 3.18). Patients with CD (OR 0.66), low-income group (OR 0.90), and female gender (OR 0.87) have a lower odds of getting hospitalized. Age above 65 years (OR 1.63), CD (OR 1.89), bowel obstruction (OR 9.24), and intra-abdominal abscess (OR 18.41) were significantly associated with surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: The IBD-related ED visits have remained relatively stable from 2009 to 2011. The presence of anemia, malnutrition, hypovolemia, electrolyte abnormalities, fever, abnormal white cell count, bowel obstruction, or intra-abdominal abscess during the ED visit was associated with hospitalization. The presence of bowel obstruction and intra-abdominal abscess was strongly associated with surgical intervention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Azathioprine [AZA] and mercaptopurine [MP] are recommended for maintenance of steroid-free remission in children with Crohn`s disease [CD]. Azathioprine-induced pancreatitis, an idiosyncratic and major side effect, has been considered as an absolute contraindication for the use of a second thiopurine in IBD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe two children with CD in whom MP were successfully trialled after a confirmed azathioprine-induced pancreatitis, being well tolerated in both cases. RESULTS: Two boys [13 and 10 years old] started exclusive enteral nutrition after diagnosis of moderate (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [wPCDAI] = 45) and mild [wPCDAI = 35] CD. Both developed an acute mild to moderate pancreatitis after 2 and 3 weeks, respectively, of AZA treatment but recovered fully in hospital after AZA withdrawal. They started on MP treatment without any adverse effect. They were tested for the presence of polymorphisms 238G>C, 460G>A, and 719A>G in the TPMT gene and 94C>A and 21>C in the ITPase. Both patients were wild-type for all tested polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine-induced acute pancreatitis should not be considered as an absolute contraindication for the use of MP. Further investigation is required to create a better understanding of the mechanism underlying the adverse events and to allow more possibilities for personalised therapy.},

   abstract = {There are no important new data on the aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease. However, some new data were presented on the possible importance of certain nutrients or drugs in the genesis of the disease, as well as other data related to genetic features and their relationship with the microbiota. A highly interesting study suggested the strong potential of serological studies in predicting the course of Crohn's disease. The value of magnetic resonance imaging and the potential of low-radiation-dose tomography were reaffirmed in the monitoring and follow-up of patients and their treatments. Studies also confirmed the utility confirmed of new (and more comfortable) methods of home measurement of faecal calprotectin levels. In individualized therapy, attempts are being made to increase the practical application of new results on anti-TNF levels and their antibodies, for example, by identifying the utility of non-trough levels. We believe that the results presented on the impact of the disease on patients themselves were especially important, from their own perspective and in diverse setting. This impact is important both for patients (not only because of the repercussions of the disease on their quality of life but also on their mental health, disability, stress, and financial situation, etc.) and for their families. Finally, interesting results were presented of well-performed studies on colorectal cancer prevention in inflammatory bowel disease. These results confirm chromoendoscopy as a key technique but suggest that technological advances could change this situation, thus simplifying prevention.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic illness of unknown etiology. The consequences that CD causes nutritionally depend on several factors. However, little is known about the nutritional practices that CD affected people adopt once diagnosed. OBJECTIVE: to explore the experience of those affected in relation to food intake, with the future goal of understanding those experiences and design effective and appropriate interventions. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: a qualitative design based on ethnographic approach was used. 19 semi-structured interviews were conducted in Alicante, until data saturation was reached and later the analysis of categories and subcategories was developed. RESULTS: 5 categories with their subcategories were identified from the data collected on the experience of feeding: 1) Beliefs about nutrition and CD, 2) Changing eating habits, 3) Finding information about food and CD, 4) The role of professionals, 5) Self-management. CONCLUSIONS: knowledge of the dietary habits of the person with CD, may provide professional workforce with the appropriate information for management and support in terms of prevention, health promotion and health education, useful for the organization of health institutions, where those things are not usually taken into account since the CD approach is purely based on clinical and pathological aspects. Consequently, it appears a need of a new CD perspective based on health, focused on promoting healthy habits and from a multidisciplinary approach.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are diagnosed between 11 and 16 years of age, commonly presenting with features of typical IBD. Children with onset of gut inflammation under 5 years of age often have a different underlying pathophysiology, one that is genetically and phenotypically distinct from other children with IBD. We therefore set out to assess whether children diagnosed after the age of 5 years, but before the age of 11, have a different clinical presentation and outcome when compared to those presenting later. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study conducted at two European Paediatric Gastroenterology Units. Two cohorts of children with IBD (total number = 160) were compared: 80 children diagnosed between 5 and 10 years (Group A), versus 80 children diagnosed between 11 and 16 (Group B). Statistical analysis included multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Group A presented with a greater disease activity (p = 0.05 for Crohn's disease (CD), p = 0.03 for Ulcerative Colitis (UC); Odds Ratio 1.09, 95 % Confidence Interval: 1.02-1.1), and disease extent (L2 location more frequent amongst Group A children with CD (p = 0.05)). No significant differences were observed between age groups in terms of gastro-intestinal and extra-intestinal signs and symptoms at disease presentation, nor was there a difference in the number of hospitalisations due to relapsing IBD during follow-up. However, children in Group A were treated earlier with immunosuppressants and had more frequent endoscopic assessments. CONCLUSION: While clinicians feel children between 5 and 10 years of age have a more severe disease course than adolescents, our analysis also suggests a greater disease burden in this age group. Nevertheless, randomized trials to document longer-term clinical outcomes are urgently needed, in order to address the question whether a younger age at disease onset should prompt per se a more "aggressive" treatment. We speculate that non-clinical factors (e.g. genetics, epigenetics) may have more potential to predict longer term outcome than simple clinical measures such as age at diagnosis.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although medical management of Crohn's disease has changed in recent years, it is unclear whether surgical management has altered. We examined rate changes of surgical interventions, stoma constructions, and subset of ileostomy and colostomy constructions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from 1988 to 2011. We examined the number of Crohn's-related operations and stoma constructions, including ileostomies and colostomies; a multivariable logistic regression model was developed. RESULTS: A total of 355,239 Crohn's-related operations were analyzed. Operations increased from 13,955 in 1988 to 17,577 in 2011, p < 0.001. Stoma construction increased from 2493 to 4283, p < 0.001. The subset of ileostomies increased from 1201 to 3169, p < 0.001 while colostomies decreased from 1351 to 1201, p = 0.05. Operation percentages resulting in stoma construction increased from 18 to 24 %, p < 0.001. Weight loss (OR 2.25, 95 % CI 1.88, 2.69) and presence of perianal fistulizing disease (OR 2.91, 95 % CI 2.31, 3.67) were most predictive for requiring stoma construction. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's-related surgical interventions and stoma constructions have increased. The largest predictors for stoma construction are weight loss and perianal fistulizing disease. As a result, nutrition should be optimized and the early involvement of a multidisciplinary team should be considered.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative complications are relatively frequent in Crohn's disease (CD) and several risk factors have been identified. The influence of genetic factors, however is unknown. METHODS: CD patients who underwent CD-related bowel resection were identified from the "Nancy IBD cohort." Postoperative complications were defined as intraabdominal infectious complications and non-intraabdominal infectious complications occurring within 90 days after operation. The influence of 203 single nucleotide polymorphisms on postoperative complication rates was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 137 patients who had undergone a CD-related bowel resection in our cohort, postoperative complications occurred in 34 cases (24.8%). Postoperative intraabdominal infections occurred in 18 cases (13.1%): 12 had anastomotic leakage and 6 had intraabdominal abscesses. In multivariate analysis, current smoker status (odds ratio [OR], 2.71; 95% CI, 1.18-6.21; P = .02) and homozygosity for the risk allele (T) Nucleotide-binding Oligomerization Domain-containing protein 2 (rs5743289; NOD2; OR, 2.07 [95% CI 1.15-3.72]; P = .01) were independent risk factors of postoperative intraabdominal infectious complications. Current smoker status NOD2 homozygosity for the risk allele (T) were not associated with non-intraabdominal infectious complications. CONCLUSION: Current smoker status was associated with increased risk of postoperative intraabdominal infectious complications. A novel association between the NOD2 allele and an increased risk of postoperative intraabdominal infectious complications was observed in this study.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Post-operative recurrence is frequent in Crohn's disease. Genetic factors associated with post-operative recurrence remain poorly understood. Identification of genetic variants associated with repeat surgery would allow risk stratification of patients who may benefit from early aggressive therapy and/or post-operative prophylactic treatment. METHODS: Crohn's disease patients who had at least one bowel resection were retrospectively identified from the "Nancy IBD cohort". Covariates and potential interactions were assessed using the Cox proportional hazard model. Kaplan-Meier curves for time to surgical recurrence were developed for 200 genetic variants and analyzed with the log-rank test. RESULTS: 137 patients had at least 1 resection in our cohort: 38 had a surgical recurrence (28%). In multivariate analysis, current smoker status (OR 6.97, 95% CI 1.85-26.22, p=0.004), post-operative complications after prior surgery (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.02-7.22, p=0.044), and Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 8 (CARD8) homozygosity for the risk allele (OR 7.56, 95% CI 1.13-50.37, p=0.036) remained significantly and independently associated with surgical recurrence. CONCLUSION: Current smoker status was associated with increased risk of surgical recurrence. A novel association between CARD8 and increased risk of surgical recurrence in Crohn's disease was observed. CARD8 could be a new marker for risk stratification and prevention of recurrent surgery.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation and nutritional deficiencies are characteristics of Crohn's disease (CD) and have been suggested to influence cognitive performance. This study assessed cognitive function in patients with CD. METHODS: Participants were adult patients with CD arriving at routine follow-up. Subjective cognitive complaints, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep were evaluated by validated questionnaires. CD characteristics, blood tests, and Crohn's disease activity index were obtained. Nutritional risk index was derived from serum albumin and change in body weight. Montreal cognitive assessment was used for screening. Patients with either subjective cognitive complaints or Montreal cognitive assessment score </= 26 were tested by a computerized cognitive testing battery, with analysis of scores in 7 cognitive domains (CogDs) and an average of the CogD scores-global cognitive score (GCS). Impaired CogD was defined as scoring more than 1 SD below age and education adjusted average. RESULTS: A total of 105 patients were recruited and 61 were tested with computerized cognitive testing battery. Mean age was 39 +/- 13 and mean education years were 14 +/- 2. The most commonly impaired CogDs were information processing speed (33%) and verbal function (28%). Crohn's disease activity index, nutritional risk index, and hemoglobin were significantly correlated with GCS (r = -0.34, 0.39, 0.33; P = 0.007, 0.003, 0.01). Linear regression revealed significant correlations between Crohn's disease activity index, nutritional risk index, and GCS (beta = -0.3, 0.29; P = 0.03, 0.04), independent of depression. This model explained 24% of the variance in GCS. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive performance is related to CD activity and nutritional status. The results provide insight into potential influence of nutrition and inflammation on cognitive function. Further studies on cognitive function of patients with CD are warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to report the short- and long-term outcomes of surgery for coloduodenal fistula in Crohn's disease and explore the effect of preoperative optimization on surgical outcome. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 34 patients with coloduodenal fistula complicating Crohn's disease between Jan 2008 and May 2015. Demographic information, preoperative management, and intraoperative and postoperative outcome data were collected. RESULTS: Primary duodenal repair was carried out in 33 patients (13 with duodenal defect >3 cm), and bypass surgery was performed in one patient with duodenal stenosis. Patients undergoing preoperative optimization (n = 25) had decreased postoperative major (24.0 vs. 87.5 %, P = 0.005) and intra-abdominal septic (20.0 vs. 75.0 %, P = 0.008) complications compared to patients with emergent/semi-emergent surgery (n = 8). No duodenal stenosis occurred on a median follow-up of 22.5 months. Patients with duodenum-ileocolic anastomosis fistula had longer postoperative stay (14.0 vs. 10.0 days, P = 0.032) and increased possibility of refistulization of the duodenum on follow-up (30.0 vs. 0 %, P = 0.031) compared with those with spontaneous duodenum-colonic fistula. CONCLUSION: Primary duodenal repair can be safely performed in coloduodenal fistula in Crohn's disease provided there was no duodenal stenosis, even for large duodenal defects. Preoperative optimization is associated with reduced postoperative complications. Patients with duodenum-ileocolic anastomosis fistula are more likely to have duodenum fistula recurrence compared to those with spontaneous duodenum-colonic fistula.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is controversy about nutrition status and calorie needs during phases of active versus inactive adult Crohn's disease (CD). Results have been reported in cross-sectional studies, but longitudinal data are unavailable. Our aim was to explore whether disease activity had an impact on resting energy expenditure (REE) and body composition in adult patients with CD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients were studied on 2 occasions with active and inactive CD. REE was measured by indirect calorimetry. Body composition was estimated from bioelectrical impedance analysis. Disease activity was measured using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Regression analyses of REE with CDAI score, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also performed. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were included. Patients with active CD had increased REE/body weight compared with patients with inactive disease (28.8 +/- 5.4 vs 25.9 +/- 4.3 kcal/kg, P < .001). Disease behavior and location, but not sex, had an impact on REE/body weight. Body mass index was lower in active disease than in remission (17.4 +/- 3.0 vs 18.1 +/- 2.6 kg/m(2), P = .010). Body composition was not affected by disease behavior or location. CONCLUSION: Patients with remission had a better nutrition status and decreased REE compared with those with active CD. REE could also be affected by disease location and behavior.},

   abstract = {Genome-wide association studies of the related chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) known as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have shown strong evidence of association to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This region encodes a large number of immunological candidates, including the antigen-presenting classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. Studies in IBD have indicated that multiple independent associations exist at HLA and non-HLA genes, but they have lacked the statistical power to define the architecture of association and causal alleles. To address this, we performed high-density SNP typing of the MHC in >32,000 individuals with IBD, implicating multiple HLA alleles, with a primary role for HLA-DRB1*01:03 in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Noteworthy differences were observed between these diseases, including a predominant role for class II HLA variants and heterozygous advantage observed in ulcerative colitis, suggesting an important role of the adaptive immune response in the colonic environment in the pathogenesis of IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important, but understudied construct in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Family level predictors of HRQOL have been understudied as are the mechanisms through which disease activity affects HRQOL. The present study examines the relation between a family level factor (parenting stress) and HRQOL in youth with Crohn disease. Parenting stress is examined as a mechanism through which disease activity affects HRQOL. METHODS: A total of 99 adolescents with Crohn disease and their parents were recruited across 3 sites. Adolescents completed the IMPACT-III (inflammatory bowel disease-specific HRQOL). Parents completed the Pediatric Inventory for Parents, a measure of medically related parenting stress that assesses stress because of the occurrence of medical stressors and stress because of the perceived difficulty of stressors. Disease activity was obtained from medical records. RESULTS: Parenting stress because of the occurrence of medical stressors partially mediated the disease severity-HRQOL relation, reducing the relation between these variables from 49.67% to 31.58% (B= -0.56, P < 0.0001). Bootstrapping analysis confirmed that the indirect effect of disease severity on HRQOL via parenting stress significantly differed from zero. Parenting stress because of the perceived difficulty of medical stressors partially mediated the disease severity-HRQOL relation, reducing the relation from 49.67% to 30.29% (B= -0.55, P < 0.0001). The indirect effect was confirmed via bootstrapping procedures. CONCLUSIONS: As disease severity increased, parenting stress also increased, and adolescent HRQOL decreased. Parenting stress should be considered and assessed for along with medical factors as part of a comprehensive approach to improve HRQOL in adolescents with Crohn disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) and their treatment in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Since 2008, the Pediatric Swiss IBD Cohort Study has collected data on the pediatric IBD population in Switzerland. Data on 329 patients were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: 55 patients (16.7%) suffered from 1-4 EIM (39 Crohn's disease, 12 ulcerative colitis and 4 IBD-Unclassified (IBD-U) patients). At IBD onset, presence of EIM was more frequent than in the adult population (8.5% vs. 5.0%, p = 0.014). EIM were more frequent in CD when compared to UC/IBD-U (22.5 vs. 10.3%, p = 0.003). The most prevalent EIM were peripheral arthritis (26/329, 7.9%) and aphthous stomatitis (24/329, 7.3%). 27.6% of all EIM appeared before IBD diagnosis. Median time between IBD diagnosis and occurrence of first EIM was 1 month (-37.5-149.0). 31 of the 55 patients (56.4%) were treated with one or more anti-TNF agents. IBD patients with EIM were more likely to be treated with anti-TNF compared to those without (56.4% vs. 35.0%, p = 0.003). Response rates to anti-TNF depended on underlying EIM and were best for peripheral arthritis (61.5%) and uveitis (66.7%). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of pediatric IBD patients, EIM were frequently encountered. In up to 30%, EIM appeared before IBD diagnosis. Knowledge of these findings might translate into an increased awareness of underlying IBD, thereby decreasing diagnostic delay. Anti- TNF for the treatment of certain EIM is effective although a substantial proportion of new EIM might present despite ongoing anti-TNF therapy.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A severe clinical phenotype along with concern for ensuring normal growth and development has a major impact on treatment choices for children newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD). AREAS COVERED: We review the increasingly outdated concept of 'conventional' therapy of pediatric CD based on aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators for patients at high risk of complicated disease. Key safety concerns with each treatment are reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: There are minimal data supporting the use of aminosalicylates in the treatment of pediatric CD. Corticosteroids are effective short-term for improving signs and symptoms of disease but are ineffective for maintenance therapy. Thiopurines decrease corticosteroid dependence but may not alter progression to complicated disease requiring surgery. Concerns for lymphoma as well as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with thiopurines are valid. Further data are required on the efficacy and safety of methotrexate as an alternative immunomodulator. Though generally well tolerated and efficacious in most patients, anti-TNF-alpha therapy can be associated with both mild as well as more serious complications. Current data do not support an increased risk for malignancy associated with anti-TNF therapy alone in children. Anti-adhesion therapy appears to have a favorable safety profile but the experience in children is extremely limited.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) induction in children with luminal Crohn's disease (CD) gives early mucosal healing (MH), but the long-term benefits of EEN-induced MH are just emerging. AIMS & METHODS: We prospectively followed an Australian cohort of newly diagnosed children with predominantly luminal CD who completed at least six weeks EEN and with paired clinical Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), biochemical (C-reactive protein; CRP) and endoscopic assessment at diagnosis and post EEN. All commenced immunomodulators (IMs) early (<3 months from diagnosis) and had a minimum of 1 year follow-up. Complete MH was a simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) of 0, and SES-CD>/=1 was ascribed to active endoscopic disease (aED) and further divided into near complete MH (SES 1-3), mild active disease (SES-CD 4-10) and moderate to severe disease (SES-CD>10). The primary outcome was long-term supervised sustained remission (SR) on IMs alone without need for corticosteroids, infliximab (IFX) or surgery. RESULTS: A total of 54 eligible children (33 males) completing EEN induction were analysed. The median duration between pre and post EEN assessments was 60.5 days [interquartile range (IQR), 56-69.5]. Post EEN: clinical remission (PCDAI < 10) was observed in 45/54 (83%), and biochemical remission (PCDAI < 10 and CRP < 5 mg/dl) was observed in 39/54 (72%). Complete MH was observed in 18/54 (33%), near complete in 10/54(19%). SR was superior in those with complete MH vs. aED; 13/18, (72%) vs. 10/36 (28%), p = 0.003 at 1 year, 8/16, (50%) vs. 3/24, (8%), p = 0.008 at 2 years and (8/16, (50%) vs. 1/19, (6%), p = 0.005) at 3 years. Near-complete MH did not lead to superior SR. CONCLUSIONS: Only complete MH post EEN induction predicts more favourable SR for up to 3 years.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Impact of first-line induction therapy on medium-term outcomes in the setting of early thiopurine (TP) use in children with Crohn's disease has not been evaluated, in particular whether choice of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) over corticosteroids (CS) for induction impacts clinical outcomes at 12 and 24 months. AIMS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 89 children from our database with new diagnosis CD and follow-up of at least 2 years following induction with exclusive course of CS or EEN and early, dose-optimized TP (within 6 months from diagnosis) were evaluated. We compared steroid dependency (relapse <3 months of tapering first course CS or inability to wean <10 mg prednisolone), need for IFX, linear growth, and surgical resections over the first 2 years. RESULTS: Choice of EEN over CS induction was associated with reduced linear growth failure (7 vs. 26%, p = 0.02), CS dependency (7 vs. 43%, p = 0.002), and improved primary sustained response to IFX (86 vs. 68%, p = 0.02). Combined CS/IFX-free remission and surgical resection rates were similar. CONCLUSION: In the setting of early TP commencement, EEN induction is superior to CS induction for reducing growth failure, CS dependency, and loss of response to IFX over the first 2 years.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maternal high-fat diet (HFD) and obesity increases the risk of the offspring to develop inflammatory processes in various organs including the gut. We hypothesized that maternal diet-induced obesity programs the fetal gut towards inflammation in a mouse model of genetically-driven Crohn's disease (CD)-like ileitis. METHODS: TNF(WT/WT) and TNF(DeltaARE/WT) dams were fed an experimental control diet (CTRLD; 13 kJ% fat) or HFD (48 kJ%). Offspring mice were fed CTRLD or HFD at 4 weeks of age. Metabolic characteristics and severity of CD-like ileitis was assessed in 8- and 12-week old WT and ARE offspring measuring tissue histopathology and markers of inflammation in the distal ileum as well as plasma cytokine and LPS levels. To study prenatal effects, we laser microdissected fetal intestinal epithelial cells at 17.5 days postconception and performed microarray-based global gene expression analysis. RESULTS: Maternal HFD significantly accelerated the severity of CD-like ileitis in HFD-fed ARE mice at early life stages associated with increased mucosal neutrophil infiltration, Il12p40 expression, and portal vein LPS levels. In contrast to WT mice, metabolic characteristics of ARE offspring were not affected by maternal HFD. Gene expression patterns in fetal intestinal epithelial cells of ARE mice remained largely unchanged under conditions of maternal diet-induced obesity suggesting that the positive association of intestinal inflammation, portal vein endotoxemia, and plasma TNF levels is independent of prenatal conditioning of the gut epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal HFD promotes the early onset of severe CD-like ileitis in genetically susceptible offspring independent of metabolic alterations.},

   abstract = {Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated to a change in stool consistency or frequency, include low-grade inflammation and intestinal microbiota changes. Few and disappointing data are available for prebiotics. A few controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics are instead available with favourable effects, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. A recent report from the Rome foundation group included 32 RCTs of probiotics, most of which showed an overall modest improvement in symptoms, with the patients most benefitting from probiotics being those with predominant diarrhoea and those having a post-infectious IBS. A review focusing only on children with functional gastrointestinal disorders concluded that probiotics are more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders, although no effect on constipation was evident. The role for probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears logical: the endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a central role in their development, and various probiotics have been found effective in animal models of IBD. However, research in humans has been overall quite limited, and it would seem that after a phase of intense research in the first decade of this century, the pace has slowed down, with fewer clinical trials been published in the past 2-3 years. To summarize current evidence: no probiotic has proven successful in Crohn's disease. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, data are more promising, and a very recent meta-analysis, that included 23 randomized controlled trials, concluded that there is evidence of efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in helping inducing and maintaining remission, as well as in maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis. It is fair to state that for both IBD and IBS, more well-designed, rigorous, randomized clinical trials must be performed.},

   abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be important for the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective therapy for inducing remission in CD. We aimed to investigate the alteration of miRNAs expression profile in the terminal ileal mucosa of CD patients before and after EEN. Twenty-five patients and ten healthy individuals were included. MiRNAs expression profile was firstly assessed using microarray technology and then validation was performed by qRT-PCR. The correlations between miRNAs and CD activity index (CDAI) score and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level were also evaluated. Microarray analysis showed that mucosal miRNAs expression profile after EEN therapy was significantly changed compared with inflamed mucosa before treatment, and was most similar to the healthy one among all CD groups. Altered expressions of hsa-miR-192-5p, hsa-miR-423-3p, hsa-miR-99a-5p, hsa-miR-124-3p, hsa-miR-301a-5p, hsa-miR-495-5p, and hsa-let-7b-5p were confirmed by qRT-PCR. hsa-let-7b-5p was significantly correlated with serum CRP levels before and after EEN treatment (r = -0.518, p = 0.008, and r = -0.569, p = 0.003). Our study showed EEN induction therapy was associated with a trend for normalizing of the mucosal miRNAs expression profile, and expression of mucosal hsa-let-7b-5p was correlated with serum CRP level in patients with CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Altering FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) intake has substantial effects on gut microbiota. This study aimed to investigate effects of altering FODMAP intake on markers of colonic health in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: After evaluation of their habitual diet, 9 patients with clinically quiescent Crohn's disease were randomised to 21 days of provided low or typical ("Australian") FODMAP diets with >/=21-day washout in between. Five-day fecal samples were collected at the end of each diet and analyzed for calprotectin, pH, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bacterial abundance. Gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded daily. RESULTS: Eight participants collected feces and were adherent to the diets. FODMAP intake differed across the three dietary periods with low<habitual<Australian diet. SCFA, pH and total bacterial abundance remained unaltered, but relative abundance was higher for butyrate-producing Clostridium cluster XIVa (P=0.008) and mucus-associated Akkermansia muciniphila (P=0.016), and lower for Ruminococcus torques (P=0.034) during the Australian compared with low FODMAP diet. Results during habitual diet were similar to the low FODMAP intervention, but significantly different to the Australian diet. The diets had no effects on calprotectin, but symptoms doubled in severity with the Australian diet (n=9; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In clinically quiescent Crohn's disease, altering dietary FODMAP intake is associated with marked changes in fecal microbiota, most consistent with a prebiotic effect of increasing FODMAPs as shown in an irritable bowel/healthy cohort. This strategy might be favorable for gut health in Crohn's disease, but at the cost of inducing symptoms.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe surgery rates, complications, and risk of disease recurrence after surgery in paediatric Crohn disease (CD). METHODS: Children <18 years with a diagnosis of CD and a least 1 intestinal resection from the period January 1, 1978 to December 31, 2007 were identified using the Danish National Patient Registry. Patient charts were used to extract data. RESULTS: A total of 115 of 422 children with CD, who had surgery in 2 referral centres, were further studied. Disease extension according to the Montreal classification at the time of operation was available in 106/115 patients: B1, 39/106 (37%); B2, 59/106 (56%); and B3, 8/106 (7%). Before/after surgery 89%/36% of the patients received corticosteroids, 26%/61% azathioprine, and 15%/34% infliximab. Ileocoecal resection was performed in 54 (47%); 17 (15%) underwent ileal resection, 21 (18%) colectomy, 13 (11%) hemicolectomy, and 10 (9%) a combined colonic and ileal resection. Median time from diagnosis to surgery was 23 months (range 0-147). The median follow-up time after surgery was 121 months (16-226), and median time to disease recurrence was 12 months (3-160). The cumulative clinical recurrence rates at 1, 5, and 10 years were 50%, 73%, and 77%, respectively. More than 1 bowel resection was needed in 39%. Postoperative azathioprine treatment did not affect rate of recurrence after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of children with CD studied for >10 years postoperatively, we found a high postoperative recurrence rate of disease and a frequent need for >1 intestinal resection.},

   abstract = {Higher body mass index (BMI), higher body adiposity and obesity have been associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. Evidence suggests that excess energy balance may influence systemic immune and inflammatory status. Thus, we hypothesized that the positive association between BMI and colorectal cancer risk might differ according to colorectal carcinoma subtypes according to levels of histopathological lymphocytic reaction to tumor. We collected biennial questionnaire data on weight and baseline height information in two prospective cohort studies, the Nurses' Health Study (1980-2010) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2010). Utilizing duplication-method Cox proportional hazards regression models, we prospectively assessed the association between BMI and risk of colorectal cancer subtypes according to the degree of Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction, peritumoral lymphocytic reaction, intratumoral periglandular reaction, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, the overall lymphocytic reaction score, or T-cell [CD3(+) , CD8(+) , CD45RO (PTPRC)(+) or FOXP3(+) ] density in tumor tissue. Statistical significance level was adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing by Bonferroni correction. During follow up of 1,708,029 men and women (over 3,346,752 person-years), we documented 1,436 incident rectal and colon cancer cases with available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue materials and pathological immunity data. BMI was significantly associated with higher risk of overall colorectal cancer (Ptrend < 0.001); however, the association of BMI with colorectal carcinoma risk did not significantly differ by the level of lymphocytic reaction or T-cell infiltration in tumor tissue status (Pheterogeneity > 0.10). BMI may be associated with risk of colorectal cancer regardless of levels of lymphocytic response to tumor.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ustekinumab is a new biologic therapy targeting interleukin-12 and interleukin -23. It is currently approved for the treatment of psoriasis, but clinical trials have shown that it can induce and maintain remission in Crohn's disease (CD). We aim to evaluate effectiveness of ustekinumab in the treatment of CD. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed including patients (pts) from 2 academic medical centers with complicated, refractory CD started on ustekinumab between June 2011 and June 2014. Pts were treated based on a novel subcutaneous dosing schedule designed to simulate the intravenous load used in clinical trials. RESULTS: Forty-five pts were treated with ustekinumab during this study period. Of the pts who had clinical parameters available before and after medication start, 46% achieved clinical response (Harvey-Bradshaw index decrease >/= 3) and 35% achieved clinical remission (Harvey-Bradshaw index </= 3). Short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire scores increased significantly (46 [20, 68] to 55 [32, 70], P < 0.05). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased significantly (20 [3, 54] to 12 [0, 42] mm/h, P < 0.05). C-reactive protein decreased significantly (4.9 [0.3, 111] to 3.3 [0.2, 226] mg/L, P < 0.05). Seventy-six percent of patients demonstrated an endoscopic response and 24% achieved complete endoscopic remission. Twelve patients (26%) were hospitalized for IBD-related issues. Four pts had infection-related complications. Six pts (13%) underwent surgery for IBD-related issues. Three pts stopped ustekinumab, 1 for pt preference and 2 for the lack of response. CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel subcutaneous dosing schedule, ustekinumab was successful in improving clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic markers of disease activity in patients with severe, refractory CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many uncertainties remain regarding optimal therapies and strategies for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Setting research priorities addressing therapies requires a partnership between health care professionals, patients and organisations supporting patients. We aimed to use the structure of the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership, which has been used in other disease areas, to identify and prioritise unanswered questions about treatments for inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The James Lind Priority Setting Partnership uses methods agreed and adopted in other disease areas to work with patients and clinicians: to identify uncertainties about treatments; to agree by consensus a prioritised list of uncertainties for research; then to translate these uncertainties into research questions which are amenable to hypothesis testing; and finally to take results to research commissioning bodies to be considered for funding. RESULTS: A total of 1636 uncertainties were collected in the initial survey from 531 respondents, which included 22% health care professionals and 78% patients and carers. Using the rigorously applied processes of the priority setting partnership, this list was distilled down to the top 10 research priorities for inflammatory bowel disease. The top priorities were: identifying treatment strategies to optimise efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness; and stratifying patients with regard to their disease course and treatment response. Diet and symptom control [pain, incontinence and fatigue] were also topics which were prioritised. CONCLUSIONS: A partnership involving multidisciplinary clinicians, patients and organisations supporting patients has identified the top 10 research priorities in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

We aimed to study food intake in children with IBD and evaluated the relation of dietary intake with disease activity and nutritional status in these children. METHODS: This cross-sectional study investigated 68 children and adolescents with IBD (57 Crohn disease, 11 ulcerative colitis). Evaluation included clinical, laboratory, and nutritional assessment including 3 days diet record. RESULTS: Compared with recommended daily allowance, the intake of patients with IBD was significantly poor for carbohydrates (75%, P = 0.016), calcium (49%, P < 0.05), magnesium (76%, P < 0.05), vitamin A (72%, P < 0.05), vitamin E (57%, P < 0.05), and fiber (44%, P < 0.05) and higher for protein (175%, P < 0.05), iron (112%, P < 0.05), and water-soluble vitamins (118%-189% P < 0.05). Compared with the intakes of healthy children from National Nutritional Survey, the intake of IBD group was lower for calories (78%, P = 0.012), carbohydrates (61% P < 0.05), magnesium (67% P < 0.05), vitamin C (34%, P < 0.05), and fiber (54%, P < 0.05) and high for B12 (141%, P < 0.05). Fifty subjects ate ordinary diets, 7 of 68 children were on exclusive enteral nutrition and 11 of 68 consumed regular food with different polymeric formulas supplements. Compared with children without supplements, children on exclusive enteral nutrition and nutritional supplements (18/68) had significantly better intakes of energy (1870 +/- 755 vs 2267 +/- 432, P < 0.05), carbohydrates (223 +/- 97 vs 292 +/- 99, P < 0.05), and all minerals (P < 0.05) and micronutrients (P < 0.05). Dietary intake was not different by disease status (remission or relapse). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of nutritional supplements, food intake is inadequate for many nutrients in many children with IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The interaction between a disturbed microbial composition, the intestinal mucosal barrier and the mucosal immune system plays an important role in IBD and its chronicity. It has been indicated that due to the altered microbial composition the balance between T regulatory cells (Treg) and T helper cells (Th) 17 is disturbed, leading to an inflammatory state. The present study shows that oral intake of a specific multi fibre mix (MF), designed to match the fibre content of a healthy diet, counteracts IBD-like intestinal inflammation and weight loss in dextran sodium sulphate treated mice. This reduction in inflammation might be brought about, at least in part, by the MF-induced decrease in inflammatory cytokines, increase in IL-10 and the relative increase in Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Moreover, the Treg percentage in the MLN correlates with the percentage of tolerogenic lamina propria derived CD103+RALDH+dendritic cells in the MLN, suggesting that these play a role in the observed effects. In children with CD exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a widely used safe and effective therapy. Optimizing enteral nutritional concepts with the tested fibre mix, know to modulate the gut microbiota composition, SCFA production and inflammatory status (as indicated by the present study) could possibly further improve efficacy in inducing remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial treatment is known to cause short- and long-term changes in the composition of normal human microbiota. The relationship between antibiotic use and overall clinical behavior in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been explored. We aim to prospectively characterize patterns of antibiotic use and clinical IBD activity in a large IBD cohort. METHODS: Prospective observational study from a longitudinal IBD natural history registry between 2009 and 2012. Antibiotic prescriptions were identified and categorized using electronic medical record data. Cumulative rates over the 4-year study period were compared. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, health care utilization, and treatment data of the patients with IBD were collected and analyzed. Quality of life was measured by Short IBD Questionnaire data. Primary outcomes were markers of disease activity including Short IBD Questionnaire scores, C-reactive protein levels, health care utilization, and medication use. RESULTS: Seven hundred eighteen patients followed over 4 years were included (47.6% male; mean age, 46.7 +/- 15.2 yr), 59.9% had Crohn's disease, whereas 38.6% had ulcerative colitis. Most patients (66.3%) were exposed to antibiotics during the study period. Antibiotic-exposed patients were more likely to have Crohn's disease (63% versus 53.7%; P = 0.05), require narcotics (43.7% versus 14.9%; P < 0.0001), receive antidepressants (43.1% versus 18.6%; P < 0.001), prednisone (52.7% versus 31%; P < 0.0001), or biological therapy (52% versus 36.5%; P < 0.0001). Antibiotic-exposed patients had a lower mean Short IBD Questionnaire (50.2 +/- 11.5 versus 56.4 +/- 9.5; P < 0.0001), higher rates of C-reactive protein elevation (49.2% versus 31.8%; P < 0.0001), and higher health care utilization compared with nonantibiotic-exposed patients. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with IBD receive antibiotic treatment, and these individuals demonstrate a more severe clinical course.},

   abstract = {Many patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), whether Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, are of reproductive age. Young women with IBD are usually very worried about their fertility, the activity of their disease during pregnancy, the heritability of the disease to their unborn child, and the effect of their underlying IBD on the pregnancy itself. Additionally, patients express concerns about using IBD medications during pregnancy, fearing that the medications may negatively affect the fetus. For this reason, it is of the utmost importance that gastroenterologists and patients with IBD be aware of the effect of IBD on pregnancy, the effect of pregnancy on IBD, and the effect of IBD medications on the fetus and on pregnancy outcomes. Increasing the awareness of patients with IBD about the importance of maintaining disease remission at the time of conception and throughout pregnancy is key to improving the outcomes of both mothers and fetuses. This article addresses the fertility of patients with IBD, the effect of pregnancy on disease activity, and the effect of IBD on pregnancy. Also discussed are which IBD medications can be used during conception and pregnancy and which medications must be avoided.},

GOAL: To investigate the combined role of all the above factors in the burden of fatigue among IBD patients. STUDY: We conducted an observational study of adult patients enrolled in an IBD clinical research registry at a tertiary care clinic. Fatigue burden was defined by Item 1 of the Short-form IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ), which is scored on a 7-point Likert scale. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) disease activity were measured with the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or the UC Activity Index, respectively. Labs were obtained to assess anemia, vitamin deficiencies, and inflammatory markers. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Use of psychotropic medications and narcotics was used as proxy measure of psychopathology and pain. RESULTS: Among 685 IBD patients enrolled in the registry, 631 (238 UC, 393 CD) had a complete SIBDQ. High fatigue burden was found in 57.5% of patients (64.4% CD, 46.2% UC). Fatigue burden was significantly associated with sleep disturbance (PSQI), SIBDQ, and disease activity. CD patients had more fatigue burden than UC patients. Multivariate regression showed that poor quality of life, sleep disturbance, and being on a psychotropic medication are significantly associated with fatigue burden for both UC and CD. CONCLUSION: Because fatigue is common in IBD patients, these findings suggest that attention to quality of sleep and psychopathology is as important as medical disease management.},

Health care providers frequently do not have adequate time to address the emotional impact of the hospitalization on the patient and family. Nonmedical support for inpatients was identified as an unmet need by a Crohn's disease patient's family. This led to the development of a volunteer peer specialist network, IBD Connect, where peer volunteers visit hospitalized patients with IBD to offer emotional support and educational materials. We aimed to determine the feasibility of incorporating IBD Connect into an inpatient IBD service, evaluate the impact of IBD Connect on patients' willingness to share their disease experience with family and friends, and improve stress. Since the inception of IBD Connect in 2012, peer volunteers have made 1469 total visits to 677 unique inpatients. Patient satisfaction of IBD Connect has been favorable with a significant decrease in stress related to the hospitalization. Similarly, there was significant increase in patients sharing their IBD diagnosis and experience with family and friends. Patients and their families are willing to share important information and ask questions to volunteers that may not have been discussed with their health care providers. In an era of patient-reported outcomes and patient-centered care, peer volunteers are an important component of chronic disease management and should be incorporated into IBD inpatient health care teams.},

We hypothesized that surgery rates have decreased while outcomes have worsened due to operating on "sicker" patients since the introduction of biologic medications. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample and ICD-9-CM codes were used to identify inpatient admissions for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Trends in IBD nutrition, surgeries, and postoperative complications were determined. RESULTS: There were 191,743 admissions for IBD during the study period. Surgery rates were largely unchanged over the study period, ranging from 9 to 12 % of admissions in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The rate of poor nutrition increased by 67 % in ulcerative colitis and by 83 % in Crohn's disease. Rates of postoperative anastomotic leak (10.2-13.9 %) were unchanged over the years. Postoperative infection rates decreased by 17 % in Crohn's disease (18 % in 2003 to 15 % in 2012; P < 0.001) but did not show a trend in any direction in ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of IBD surgery have remained stable while postoperative infectious complications have remained stable or decreased since the implementation of biologic therapies. We identified an increase in poor nutrition in surgical patients.},

However, in 20-33% of patients, abdominal wall-related complications occur after isolated intestinal transplantation. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient is a 24-year-old woman with ultra-short bowel syndrome, caused by a severely complicated history of Crohn's disease. After 5 years of TPN, the patient was referred for intestinal transplantation. In addition, an abdominal wall transplant was required due to an abdominal wall defect, extensive scarring of the abdominal wall and lack of free space within the abdomen. Therefore, a combined intestinal and abdominal wall transplantation was performed. Six months after transplantation the patient has a sufficient abdominal wall, a normal body mass index and no longer requires any feeding lines. CONCLUSION: This case report describes the first combined intestinal and abdominal wall transplantation in the Netherlands and in the Eurotransplant region in a patient with end-stage intestinal failure and loss of abdominal domain.},

The symptom of the mice model induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) is closed to human under CD condition, so this kind of animal is widely used in the related researches. Although the dysbiosis of the fecal microbiota has been proved to play an important role in the patients with CD, the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota in the mouse model under disease condition is still unclear. In the current study, male 7-week BALB/c mice were anesthetized and intrarectal administrated by ethanol (ET group), TNBS in ethanol (TN group), and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (CK group) as control. The symptoms of individuals under the CD condition were observed, and the changes of the bacterial taxonomic structure and functional composition were revealed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) 16S sequencing. The BALB/c mice in TN group demonstrated CD-like symptoms and the damages in the intestinal tract. The NGS 16S results exhibited that the diversity and microbial composition under CD condition are significantly different with those in ET group. The KEGG Orthology (KO) profile were generated from PICRUSt, and function modules such as methanogenesis (M00347) and microcin C transport system (M00349) were found enriched in the individuals in the TN group. This study proved that mouse model induced by TNBS could develop the similar symptom to CD patient, and we firstly showed the significant intestinal microbe changes on both taxonomic structure and functional composition in this mouse model.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors of early surgical intervention in Crohn's disease (CD) patients with spontaneous intra-abdominal abscess. METHODS: Clinical data of 94 CD patients with spontaneous intra-abdominal abscess admitted to The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University between May 2008 and Dec 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. Univariate and multivariate analysis were applied to evaluate the early surgery risk of CD patients with spontaneous intra-abdominal abscess using logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 94 eligible patients were identified from our registry, including 70 males and 24 females. The mean age at the diagnosis of CD and at development of abscess was 28.4 years and 30.4 years old, respectively. The median duration of CD between the diagnosis and development of an abscess was 3 years. According to the Montreal classification, L3 (ileocolonic) was the most common disease location (81.9%) in these patients. Most of the patients(76.6%) developed a single abscess, while multiple abscesses were detected in 22 patients(23.4%). Forty-four patients(46.8%) underwent surgery within 60 days after hospitalization due to spontaneous intra-abdominal abscess complicating CD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that history of abdominal surgery(OR=3.23, 95%CI:1.12 to 9.31, P=0.030), concomitant intestinal stenosis (OR=3.52, 95%CI:1.26 to 9.85, P=0.017) and concomitant intestinal fistula (OR=4.31, 95%CI:1.25 to 14.80, P=0.020) were the independent risk factors of early surgical intervention, while enteral nutrition (OR=0.18, 95%CI:0.05 to 0.62, P=0.007) was the independent protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of CD patients with spontaneous intra-abdominal abscess will undergo early surgical intervention. Patients with history of abdominal surgery, concomitant intestinal stenosis and concomitant intestinal fistula have higher risk of early surgical intervention, and appropriate application of enteral nutrition may reduce the risk.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the existence of mucosal dysbiosis in siblings of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) using 454 pyrosequencing and to comprehensively characterise and determine the influence of genotypical and phenotypical factors, on that dysbiosis. Siblings of patients with CD have elevated risk of developing CD and display aspects of disease phenotype, including faecal dysbiosis. Whether the mucosal microbiota is disrupted in these at-risk individuals is unknown. DESIGN: Rectal biopsy DNA was extracted from 21 patients with quiescent CD, 17 of their healthy siblings and 19 unrelated healthy controls. Mucosal microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and were classified into core and rare species. Genotypical risk was determined using Illumina Immuno BeadChip, faecal calprotectin by ELISA and blood T-cell phenotype by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Core microbiota of both patients with CD and healthy siblings was significantly less diverse than controls. Metacommunity profiling (Bray-Curtis (SBC) index) showed the sibling core microbial composition to be more similar to CD (SBC=0.70) than to healthy controls, whereas the sibling rare microbiota was more similar to healthy controls (SBC=0.42). Faecalibacterium prausnitzii contributed most to core metacommunity dissimilarity both between siblings and controls, and between patients and controls. Phenotype/genotype markers of CD risk significantly influenced microbiota variation between and within groups, of which genotype had the largest effect. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with elevated CD-risk display mucosal dysbiosis characterised by reduced diversity of core microbiota and lower abundance of F. prausnitzii. This dysbiosis in healthy people at risk of CD implicates microbiological processes in CD pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant. Patients with pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) differ from adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease with regard to phenotype, inflammatory profile, and treatment response. We hypothesized that variations in CRP and CRP genotype influence PIBD phenotype, natural history, and remission after anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy. METHODS: Six single nucleotide polymorphisms tagging CRP (rs1935193, rs1130864, rs1205, rs1417938, rs11265263, and rs1800947) were genotyped in 465 patients with PIBD (diagnosed <17 yr). Phenotyping was serially performed until last follow-up and serum CRP levels recorded at diagnosis and before biological therapy in a subgroup. RESULTS: CRP haplotype (ATGCTC) differed in those diagnosed <10 years, with rs1205T more frequent in Crohn's disease (CD) than ulcerative colitis (UC) (P = 0.009); the haplotype ATGCTC was less frequent in UC (P = 0.002). Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1205, rs1130864, and rs1417938) showed association with elevated CRP levels at diagnosis. CRP genotype had no association with CD phenotype or natural history. CRP was more frequently raised at diagnosis in CD than UC (63% versus 22%, P < 0.0001). Elevated CRP at diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of progression to surgery in patients with CD (P < 0.0001) and the need for azathioprine in the overall PIBD cohort (P = 0.002). There was no effect of CRP genotype or serum CRP on the achievement of remission using anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy. CONCLUSIONS: CRP and CRP genotype differ between pediatric patients with CD and UC with a high inflammatory burden at diagnosis suggesting a worse prognosis. Additional evaluation of CRP in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis and natural history is now warranted.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Anal fistula in Crohn's disease is frequently an intractable condition. Methods of treatment are still debated because the results of various procedures are unsatisfactory. Available studies show that results can be improved using a combination of surgical and medical methods. Most patients undergo rather palliative than radical, curative procedures such as incision and drainage of abscesses and prolonged non-cutting seton placement. Surgery is combined today with biological therapy using infliximab, a murine-human chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha or adalimumab a human monoclonal anti-TNF antibody to increase the healing process and in an attempt to prevent fistula recurrence. METHODS: Medical records of 23 patients who were treated for anal fistulas in Crohn's disease between 2012 and 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: There were 10 (43%) males and 13 females. The mean age was 39 years (range 29-60 years). Median duration of CD before present treatment was 6 years (range 1-15 years). Closure of all fistulas in 6 months was achieved in eight (35%) patients, whereas reduction of at least 50% from base line in the number of draining fistulas occurred in four (17%) patients. CONCLUSION: Palliative and combined therapy for anal fistulas in Crohn's disease with surgery and infliximab or adalimumab therapy is an effective treatment for some patients.},

   abstract = {Anal fistulas occurring in Crohn's disease (CD) comprise a risk factor of severe course of inflammation. They are frequently intractable due to various factors such as penetration of the anal canal or rectal wall, impaired wound healing, and immunosuppression, among others. Anal fistulas typical to CD develop from fissures or ulcers of the anal canal or rectum. Accurate identification of the type of fistula, such as low and simple or high and complex, is crucial for prognosis as well as for the choice of treatment. If fistulotomy remains the gold standard in the surgical treatment of the former, it is contraindicated in high and complex fistulas due to possible risk of damage to the anal sphincter with subsequent faecal incontinence. Therefore, the latter require a conservative and palliative approach, such as an incision and drainage of abscesses accompanying fistulas or prolonged non-cutting seton placement. Currently, conservative, sphincter-preserving, and definitive procedures such as mucosal advancement or dermal island flaps, the use of plugs or glue, video assisted anal fistula treatment, ligation of the intersphincteric track, and vacuum assisted closure are gaining a great deal of interest. Attempting to close the internal opening without injuring the sphincter is a major advantage of those methods. However, both the palliative and the definitive procedures require adjuvant therapy with medical measures.},

   abstract = {Milk represents a unique resource for translational medicine: It contains a rich pool of biologically active molecules with demonstrated clinical benefits. The ongoing characterization of the mechanistic process through which milk components promote development and immunity has revealed numerous milk-derived compounds with potential applications as clinical therapies in infectious and inflammatory disease, cancer, and other conditions. Lactoferrin is an effective antimicrobial and antiviral agent in high-risk patient populations and a potentially potent adjuvant to chemotherapy in lung cancer. Enteric nutrition formulas supplemented with transforming growth factor beta, a milk cytokine, have been shown to promote remission in pediatric Crohn's disease. A number of milk glycans, including human milk oligosaccharides, show promise in preclinical studies as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents. While active preclinical investigations of human milk may soon result in large-scale production of human milk molecules, bovine milk components in many instances represent a practical source of bioactive milk compounds for use in clinical trials. This review summarizes current efforts to translate the compounds derived from human and bovine milk into effective clinical therapies. These efforts suggest a common pathway for the translation of milk-derived compounds into clinical applications.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine (a) the incidence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), (b) whether and how the occurrence and severity of RLS is related to severity of CD, and (c) how RLS influences the quality of life of CD patients. BASIC METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional questionnaire study in a random selection of 144 CD patients and 80 controls. Differences were calculated using a chi-test (categorical data), an independent T-test (continuous data, normal distribution), or a Mann-Whitney U-test (continuous data, non-normal distribution). Logistic regression analysis was carried out to establish the relation between CD and RLS after adjusting for risk factors. MAIN RESULTS: The prevalence of RLS was 25.7% (37/144) in CD patients compared with 12.5% (10/80) in the control group (P=0.02). CD patients using caffeine and patients with arthralgias had a higher risk for RLS. A higher score on the modified Harvey Bradshaw Index and CD-related surgery were also associated with a higher risk for RLS. CD-related surgery was also associated with a more severe course of RLS. Patients and controls with RLS had a lower score on 'physical functioning', one of the subcategories of the RAND-36 quality-of-life questionnaire. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSION: RLS occurs more frequently in patients with CD compared with healthy individuals. A more severe course of CD seems to be associated with a higher risk for RLS. The presence of RLS has a negative influence on quality of life, mainly interfering with physical activities of daily life.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Low serum trough levels (TLs) of infliximab (IFX) and antibodies to IFX (ATIs) are associated with the loss of therapeutic response in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving IFX. Until now, pediatric data are scarce. Therefore, we aimed to cross-sectionally investigate the association between ATIs and IFX TLs, and clinical and biochemical disease activity in children receiving IFX for IBD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children aged <18 years receiving IFX maintenance treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) at three Dutch hospitals were included. Prior to two consecutive IFX infusions, IFX TLs and ATI levels were measured. Clinical disease activity was determined by Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI), for CD and UC, respectively. Biochemical disease activity was assessed by serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FC). Clinical remission was defined as a PUCAI or PCDAI score of <10. Therapeutic range of IFX was considered 3-7 microg/ml. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were included (31 CD; 16 females). Median age was 15 years. Median IFX TL was 3.5 microg/ml [IQR 2-7]. Subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic TLs were found in 38% and 23% of children, respectively. ATIs were detected in four patients. A correlation was found between IFX TL and CRP [rs = -0.51; p < 0.01] and FC [rs = -0.49; p < 0.01]. However, when only clinical disease activity was considered, no difference in median TL was found between remission and active disease (resp. 3.5 microg/ml [IQR 2-5] and 2.3 microg/ml [IQR 0.3-4.6]; p = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: IFX TLs are related to biochemical markers of disease activity. This could provide a rationale for monitoring TLs in children receiving IFX for IBD.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: In adult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, there is a strong discrepancy between symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation. Data on pediatric IBD patients are conflicting. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the relationship between clinical symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation in pediatric IBD. Patients aged <18 years with previously diagnosed Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) were included. Clinical disease activity was determined using the abbreviated Pediatric CD Activity Index (aPCDAI) or Pediatric UC Activity Index (PUCAI). Biochemical disease activity was assessed using fecal calprotectin (FC) and C-reactive protein (CRP). In total, 127 patients (62 male; median age 14.9 years) were included (82 CD, 45 UC). FC correlated weakly with total aPCDAI score (r s = 0.32; 95 % CI 0.12-0.51; p = 0.003) and total PUCAI score (r s = 0.36; 95 % CI 0.07-0.62; p = 0.015). Only aPCDAI components abdominal examination and perirectal disease and PUCAI component activity level had a significant correlation with levels of FC. CRP correlated weakly with total aPCDAI score (r s = 0.28; 95 % CI 0.05-0.46; p = 0.012) and aPCDAI components abdominal examination and activity level. No significant correlation was observed between CRP and total PUCAI score (r s = 0.01; 95 % CI -0.34-0.29; p = 0.961) or individual PUCAI components. CONCLUSION: There is a strong discrepancy between clinical symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation in children with IBD. WHAT IS KNOWN: * A substantial proportion of asymptomatic pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients have elevated biomarkers of inflammation. * There is a strong discrepancy between symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation in adults with IBD. What is New: * Clinical symptoms are only weakly associated with levels of fecal calprotectin and serum C-reactive protein in children and adolescents with previously diagnosed IBD. * Similarly to adult IBD patients, there is a strong discrepancy between clinical symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation in children with IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the role of methotrexate (MTX) in the maintenance of clinical remission and mucosal healing in children with Crohn's disease (CD), in whom azathioprine (AZA) treatment failed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study which included all children who were diagnosed with CD during a period of 10 years and who received MTX for >/=12 months after failed AZA treatment. Remission was assessed clinically, defined by Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index as a score of </=10 and no need for the reintroduction of the remission induction therapy. In the subset of patients with sustained clinical remission, the rate of mucosal healing was endoscopically assessed. Endoscopic lesions were assessed by Simple Endoscopic Score for CD. Each patient served as his or her own historical control. RESULTS: Of the 32 included patients, 22 (68.7%) remained in the stable clinical remission after a period of 12 months and 14 (43.8%) did not experience relapse during the whole follow up (median duration 2.9 years; range 1-4.8 years). From all patients who were in clinical remission during the entire follow up (n = 14), endoscopy was performed in eight (57%) patients and showed complete mucosal healing macroscopically (Simple Endoscopic Score for CD score of 0) and microscopically in seven out of eight (87.5%) patients. CONCLUSION: MTX was found to be an efficient therapeutic alternative in the thiopurine-resistant patients, enabling the complete mucosal healing.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet and body composition play unclear roles in the pathogenesis, activity and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Evidence-based guidance regarding dietary modification in IBD is lacking. We aimed to determine the attitudes of IBD patients and clinicians to diet. METHODS: The present cross-sectional study comprised an online questionnaire distributed to members of a national IBD patient organisation, assessing demographics, anthropometry, disease phenotype and dietary beliefs. Dietitians, gastroenterologists and surgeons were targeted for a similar questionnaire as a result of membership of national professional bodies. RESULTS: Nine hundred and twenty-eight patients (72.2% female; mean age 39.5 years; age range 5-91 years) responded. Two-thirds of the patients had Crohn's disease. The mean reported body mass index was 24.9 kg m-2 and was significantly skewed to the right. Patients who had taken >10 courses of steroids were had a greater probability of being overweight or obese, independent of disease complications. Most patients (71%) assumed that their diet affected their IBD; 61% considered their IBD specialist disregarded the importance of diet. Of the 136 clinicians who responded, the majority felt that diet was a factor in symptoms and intestinal microbiota. More gastroenterologists (44%) than dietitians (17%) considered that diet had a role in the pathogenesis of IBD (P = 0.003). Twenty-six percent of patients reported receiving dietary advice from their IBD specialist, whereas 98% of gastroenterologists reported advice provision. Patients received diverse advice. Half of the patients followed recommendations provided by a clinician. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that IBD patients consider diet to be important in their disease. IBD clinicians from different disciplines have diverse views of the role of diet. Advice given to patients is heterogeneous, often perceived as inadequate and poorly followed.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Medications such as corticosteroids, thiopurines, immunomodulators and biologic agents are used to induce and maintain remission; however, response to these drugs is variable and can diminish over time. Defective autophagy has been strongly linked to IBD pathogenesis, with evidence showing that enhancing autophagy may be therapeutically beneficial by regulating inflammation and clearing intestinal pathogens. It is plausible that the therapeutic effects of some IBD drugs are mediated in part through modulation of the autophagy pathway, with studies investigating a wide range of diseases and cell types demonstrating autophagy pathway regulation by these agents. This review will highlight the current evidence, both in vitro and in vivo, for the modulation of autophagy by drugs routinely used in IBD. A clearer understanding of their mechanisms of action will be invaluable to utilize these drugs in a more targeted and personalized manner in this diverse and often complex group of patients.},

An adequate preoperative preparation including improvement of the nutritional status, weaning off or stopping immunosuppressive medication and preoperative drainage of abscesses can decrease the complication rate. With the exception of when neoplasia is present, bowel-sparing techniques (e. g. strictureplasty and limited resection) are now standard, which has resulted in a low risk of short bowel syndrome. The laparoscopic approach is possible for most indications even in the case of recurrent disease, in primary ileocecal resection the laparoscopic approach has been shown to be superior to the open approach. None of the available techniques for anastomotic reconstruction of the bowels has been shown to be superior. A drainage seton is a good option to retain the quality of life in complex fistulas and reconstructive repair should only be considered when the rectum is free from inflammation.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recent research suggests a relationship of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and depression. Our objective was to evaluate for improvement of depressive symptoms with treatment of IBD using immunosuppressive medications. METHODS: A retrospective study of consecutive patients with IBD started on immunosuppressive agents [anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) or immunomodulator therapy] was conducted. Patients were evaluated if disease activity indices using Harvey Bradshaw Index for Crohn's disease (CD) and Simple Clinical Colitis Disease Activity Index for ulcerative colitis (UC) and depressive indices using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores were obtained before and at least 30 days after initiation of therapy. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with UC and 53 patients with CD (all with active disease symptoms) were evaluated over a 60 day median follow-up evaluation (range 30, 140 days). Twenty-two patients started on immunomodulator therapy, and 47 patients started on anti-TNF therapy. Crohn's disease patients had significantly decreased PHQ-9 scores at follow-up [median 9 (range 3, 14) to 4 (1, 8)], with significant decreases only in those started on anti-TNF therapy. Changes in PHQ-9 and CRP were correlated (rho = 0.38, p < 0.05). In patients with UC, PHQ-9 scores [5 (3, 9) to 2 (0, 5)] were significantly decreased. Percentage at risk of moderate to severe depression (PHQ-9 scores >/=10) was lower after treatment [Crohn's disease 51-18 % (p < 0.05), ulcerative colitis 18-0 %]. CONCLUSION: Depressive scores decreased significantly in patients with IBD treated with immunosuppressive therapy and the number at risk for moderate to severe depression improved significantly.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The duration of remission has been shown to be longer in patients initially treated with exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) compared to corticosteroids (CS). However, no published studies required concurrent immunomodulator [6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine (AZA)] use at the time of diagnosis. AIMS: The aims of this retrospective study were to compare the duration of remission between patients initially treated with AZA in combination with CS or EEN and identify predictors of early relapse in these patients. METHODS: Data from 65 newly diagnosed children with CD in clinical remission on either EEN or CS and commencing AZA at diagnosis were included. We compared duration of remission using physician global assessment and carried out Cox regression analysis to identify predictors of early relapse. Patients were followed up to the time of first relapse or for at least 12 months. RESULTS: There were no differences in the duration of remission between patients initially treated with EEN or CS (p = 0.978). We identified younger age at diagnosis [hazard ratio (HR) 0.87, 95 CI 0.78-0.98, p = 0.016], lower height Z score at diagnosis (HR 0.61, 95 CI 0.44-0.85, p = 0.003), involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract (HR 2.69, 95 CI 1.27-5.66, p = 0.009), and elevated platelet count at remission (HR 1.004, 95 CI 1.001-1.008, p = 0.021) as independent predictors of early relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Neither induction regime demonstrated longer duration of remission of CD in patients treated with immunomodulators since the time of diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has familial aggregation in African Americans (AAs), but little is known about the molecular genetic susceptibility. Mapping studies using the Immunochip genotyping array expand the number of susceptibility loci for IBD in Caucasians to 163, but the contribution of the 163 loci and European admixture to IBD risk in AAs is unclear. We performed a genetic mapping study using the Immunochip to determine whether IBD susceptibility loci in Caucasians also affect risk in AAs and identify new associated loci. METHODS: We recruited AAs with IBD and without IBD (controls) from 34 IBD centers in the United States; additional controls were collected from 4 other Immunochip studies. Association and admixture loci were mapped for 1088 patients with Crohn's disease, 361 with ulcerative colitis, 62 with IBD type unknown, and 1797 controls; 130,241 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed. RESULTS: The strongest associations were observed between ulcerative colitis and HLA rs9271366 (P = 7.5 x 10(-6)), Crohn's disease and 5p13.1 rs4286721 (P = 3.5 x 10(-6)), and IBD and KAT2A rs730086 (P = 2.3 x 10(-6)). Additional suggestive associations (P < 4.2 x 10(-5)) were observed between Crohn's disease and IBD and African-specific SNPs in STAT5A and STAT3; between IBD and SNPs in IL23R, IL12B, and C2orf43; and between ulcerative colitis and SNPs near HDAC11 and near LINC00994. The latter 3 loci have not been previously associated with IBD, but require replication. Established Caucasian associations were replicated in AAs (P < 3.1 x 10(-4)) at NOD2, IL23R, 5p15.3, and IKZF3. Significant admixture (P < 3.9 x 10(-4)) was observed for 17q12-17q21.31 (IZKF3 through STAT3), 10q11.23-10q21.2, 15q22.2-15q23, and 16p12.2-16p12.1. Network analyses showed significant enrichment (false discovery rate <1 x 10(-5)) in genes that encode members of the JAK-STAT, cytokine, and chemokine signaling pathways, as well those involved in pathogenesis of measles. CONCLUSIONS: In a genetic analysis of 3308 AA IBD cases and controls, we found that many variants associated with IBD in Caucasians also showed association evidence with these diseases in AAs; we also found evidence for variants and loci not previously associated with IBD. The complex genetic factors that determine risk for or protection against IBD in different populations require further study.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psychosocial factors surrounding eating and drinking, such as enjoying food, managing restrictions, and maintaining social relationships, remain under-researched in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. This study aimed to develop and validate a food-related quality of life [FR-QoL] questionnaire to systematically measure these issues in the IBD population. METHODS: Following semi-structured interviews with 28 IBD patients, 150 potential questionnaire items were generated. These were ranked by 100 IBD patients, and items were removed based on ceiling/floor effects and high inter-item correlations [> 0.7], with 41 items being retained. In total, 323 IBD patients, 100 asthma patients [chronic disease control], and 117 healthy controls completed the FR-QoL questionnaire, alongside generic and disease-specific QoL and food satisfaction questionnaires. Principal components analysis [PCA], construct and discriminant validity, and test-retest reliability were calculated. RESULTS: Twelve items were removed following PCA. The reduced questionnaire [FR-QoL-29] explained 63.9% of the variance [Cronbach's alpha = 0.96]. FR-QoL-29 correlated significantly with generic QoL [r = 0.697], depression [r = -0.519], anxiety [r = -0.531], and food satisfaction [r = 0.701]. The FR-QoL-29 sumscores were significantly lower for IBD (89.5, standard deviation [SD] 28.6) than asthma [125.4, SD 24.1; p < 0.001] and healthy volunteers [123.0, SD 16.5; p<0.001]. Within IBD, worse food-related QoL was found in those with moderate/high disease activity [66.7, SD 22.1] compared with remission/low disease activity [92.5, SD 28.1]. Test-retest reliability was good (intra-class correlation [ICC] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.76:0.88). CONCLUSIONS: The FR-QoL-29 shows good reliability and validity across a range of IBD characteristics. This easily administered questionnaire is a useful tool in identifying poor food-related QoL and in the future may identify areas for intervention.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been described in adults with Crohn's disease, but its use in pediatric Crohn's patients has been limited. The purpose of this study was to review our experience with SILS in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed for patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease who underwent small bowel resection or ileocecectomy at a freestanding children's hospital from 2006 to 2014. Data collected included demographic data, interval from diagnosis to surgery, operative time, length of stay, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: Analysis identified 19 patients who underwent open surgery (OS) and 41 patients who underwent SILS. One patient (2.4 %) within the SILS group required conversion to OS. Demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 cohorts. The most common indication for surgery was stricture/obstruction (SILS 70.7 % vs. OS 68.4 %, p = 0.86), and ileocecectomy was the most common primary procedure performed (SILS 90.2 % vs. OS 100 % OS). Operative times were longer for SILS (135 +/- 50 vs. 105 +/- 37 min, p = 0.02). However, when the last 20 SILS cases were compared to all OS cases, the difference was no longer statistically significant (SILS 123.3 +/- 34.2 vs. OS 105 +/- 36.5, p = 0.12). No difference was noted in postoperative length of stay (SILS 6.5 +/- 2.2 days vs. OS 7.4 +/- 2.2 days, p = 0.16) or overall complication rate (SILS 24.4 % vs. OS 26.3 %, p = 0.16). CONCLUSION: SILS ileocecectomy is feasible in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, achieving outcomes similar to OS. As experience increased, operative times also became comparable.},

We describe the reversal of IFALD in an adult patient with IF secondary to severe Crohn's disease and multiple small bowel resections. The patient developed liver dysfunction and pathology consistent with IFALD. Multiple causal factors were implicated, including nutrition-related factors, catheter sepsis and the use of hepatotoxic medications. Multidisciplinary treatment in a tertiary IF referral centre included aggressive sepsis management, discontinuation of hepatotoxic medications and a reduction of parenteral nutrition dependency through optimisation of enteral nutrition via distal enteral tube feeding. Upon this, liver function tests normalised.},

   abstract = {In the recent decades the rapid development of the studies on new methods used in diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and monitoring the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases has been observed. To the diagnostics of gastrointestinal disorders new methods such as endoscopic capsule and imaging methods including magnetic resonance have been introduced. Markers of inflammation detected in stool play significant role in the diagnostics. To the best known belong calprotectine and lactoferrin, which are produced by neutral granulocytes. In the present review we have presented the clinical usefulness of detection in the stool of calprotectin, lectoferrin, S100A12 protein and pyruvate kinase. Clinical usefulness of these markers were used in diagnosis, assessment of the treatment results, disease relapse and mucosal healing in inflammatory bowel disease. Determination of fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in the process of mucosal healing in ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease are of particular value. Confirmation of these results in multicenter prospective trials will enable in the future to reduce the number of control colonoscopies, which in children are performer under general anesthesia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infliximab is a biological drug used for the treatment of Crohn's disease in children. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study was the estimation of effectiveness and safety of infliximab in the treatment of Crohn's disease with perianal fistulas in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis comprised 50 children with Crohn's disease with perianal fistulas aged 9 to 18 years (16 girls and 34 boys) who failed to respond to conventional therapy. The children were divided into two groups: the first group contained 23 children with simple fistulas and the second - 27 children with complex fistulas. All children were treated with infliximab, administered in the dose of 5 mg per kilogram of the body mass. In the induction phase infliximab was administered at weeks 0, 2 and 6 and after clinical response in maintenance phase the drug was administered every 8 weeks; together for 12 months. RESULTS: In 76% of children after induction therapy with infliximab and in 71.87% after maintenance therapy the complete closure of fistula occurred. During the first year after the treatment a recurrence of a fistula was observed in 30.43% of the children. In two children anaphylactic shock was observed during injection of infliximab. The remaining children tolerated the drug well. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment with infliximab was effective in the majority of fistulazing Crohn's disease and caused the closure of perianal fistula which improved quality of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the major forms of inflammatory bowel disease, and pathogenesis involves a complex interplay among genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. We evaluated isoform expression of the IL-12-activated transcription factor STAT4 in children with CD and UC. METHODS: We collected biopsy samples from both patients newly diagnosed with CD and with UC. We further collected blood samples from patients newly diagnosed with CD and with UC as well as from patients who had a flare-up after being in clinical remission, and we examined the ratios of STAT4beta/STAT4alpha mRNA. In addition to STAT4 isoforms, we measured the expression of the cytokines TNFalpha, IFNgamma, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and IL-17 using polymerase chain reaction of biopsy samples and multiplex analysis of patient serum samples. RESULTS: Ratios of STAT4beta/STAT4alpha were increased in specific gastrointestinal tract segments in both patients with CD and those with UC that correlate with the location and severity of inflammation. In contrast, we did not observe changes in STAT4beta/STAT4alpha ratios in biopsy specimens from patients with eosinophilic esophagitis. We also observed increased STAT4beta/STAT4alpha ratios in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with UC and those with CD, compared with healthy controls. Ratios were normalized after patients were treated with steroids. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data indicate that STAT4 isoforms could be an important noninvasive biomarker in the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and that expression of these isoforms might provide further insight into the pathogenesis of IBD.},

   abstract = {In Crohn disease, bowel-preserving surgery is necessary to prevent short bowel syndrome due to repeated operations. This study aimed to determine the remnant small bowel length cut-off and to evaluate the clinical factors related to nutritional status after small bowel resection in Crohn disease.We included 394 patients (69.3% male) who underwent small bowel resection for Crohn disease between 1991 and 2012. Patients who were classified as underweight (body mass index < 17.5) or at high risk of nutrition-related problems (modified nutritional risk index < 83.5) were regarded as having a poor nutritional status. Preliminary remnant small bowel length cut-offs were determined using receiver operating characteristic curves. Variables associated with poor nutritional status were assessed retrospectively using Student t tests, chi-squared tests, Fisher exact tests, and logistic regression analyses.The mean follow-up period was 52.9 months and the mean patient ages at the time of the last bowel surgery and last follow-up were 31.2 and 35.7 years, respectively. The mean remnant small bowel length was 331.8 cm. Forty-three patients (10.9%) underwent ileostomy, 309 (78.4%) underwent combined small bowel and colon resection, 111 (28.2%) had currently active disease, and 105 (26.6%) underwent at least 2 operations for recurrent disease. The mean body mass index and modified nutritional risk index were 20.6 and 100.8, respectively. The independent factors affecting underweight status were remnant small bowel length </=240 cm (odds ratio: 4.84, P < 0.001), ileostomy (odds ratio: 4.70, P < 0.001), and currently active disease (odds ratio: 4.16, P < 0.001). The independent factors affecting high nutritional risk were remnant small bowel length </=230 cm (odds ratio: 2.84, P = 0.012), presence of ileostomy (odds ratio: 3.36, P = 0.025), and currently active disease (odds ratio: 4.90, P < 0.001).Currently active disease, ileostomy, and remnant small bowel length </=230 cm are risk factors affecting the poor nutritional status of patients with Crohn disease after small bowel resection.},

   abstract = {Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase response protein in the liver, and SAA1 is the major precursor protein involved in amyloid A amyloidosis. This amyloidosis has been reported as a complication in chronic inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, lupus, and Crohn's disease. Obesity is also associated with chronic, low-grade inflammation and sustained, elevated levels of SAA1. However, the contribution of elevated circulating SAA1 to metabolic disturbances and their complications is unclear. Furthermore, in several recent studies of transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing SAA1 that were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for a relatively short period, no relationship was found between SAA1 up-regulation and metabolic disturbances. Therefore, we generated TG mice overexpressing SAA1 in the liver, challenged these mice with an HFD, and investigated the influence of elevated SAA1 levels. Sustained, elevated levels of SAA1 were correlated with metabolic parameters and local cytokine expression in the liver following 16 weeks on the HFD. Moreover, prolonged consumption (52 weeks) of the HFD was associated with impaired glucose tolerance and elevated SAA1 levels and resulted in systemic SAA1-derived amyloid deposition in the kidney, liver, and spleen of TG mice. Thus, we concluded that elevated SAA1 levels under long-term HFD exposure result in extensive SAA1-derived amyloid deposits, which may contribute to the complications associated with HFD-induced obesity and metabolic disorders.},

   abstract = {Malnutrition is a frequent feature in Crohn's disease (CD), affects patient outcome and must be recognised. For chronic inflammatory diseases, recent guidelines recommend the development of combined malnutrition and inflammation risk scores. We aimed to design and evaluate a new screening tool that combines both malnutrition and inflammation parameters that might help predict clinical outcome. In a prospective cohort study, we examined fifty-five patients with CD in remission (Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) <200) at 0 and 6 months. We assessed disease activity (CDAI, Harvey-Bradshaw index), inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), faecal calprotectin (FC)), malnutrition (BMI, subjective global assessment (SGA), serum albumin, handgrip strength), body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis) and administered the newly developed 'Malnutrition Inflammation Risk Tool' (MIRT; containing BMI, unintentional weight loss over 3 months and CRP). All parameters were evaluated regarding their ability to predict disease outcome prospectively at 6 months. At baseline, more than one-third of patients showed elevated inflammatory markers despite clinical remission (36.4 % CRP >/=5 mg/l, 41.5 % FC >/=100 microg/g). Prevalence of malnutrition at baseline according to BMI, SGA and serum albumin was 2-16 %. At 6 months, MIRT significantly predicted outcome in numerous nutritional and clinical parameters (SGA, CD-related flares, hospitalisations and surgeries). In contrast, SGA, handgrip strength, BMI, albumin and body composition had no influence on the clinical course. The newly developed MIRT was found to reliably predict clinical outcome in CD patients. This screening tool might be used to facilitate clinical decision making, including treatment of both inflammation and malnutrition in order to prevent complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In the past decades, treatment options and strategies for ulcerative colitis [UC] have radically changed. Whether these developments have altered the disease outcome at population level is yet unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the disease outcome of UC over the past two decades in the South-Limburg area of The Netherlands. METHODS: In the Dutch population-based IBDSL cohort, three time cohorts were defined: cohort 1991-1997 [cohort A], cohort 1998-2005 [cohort B], and cohort 2006-2010 [cohort C]. The colectomy and hospitalisation rates were compared between cohorts by Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Hazard ratios [HR] for early colectomy [within 6 months after diagnosis], late colectomy [beyond 6 months after diagnosis], and hospitalisation were calculated using Cox regression models. RESULTS: In total, 476 UC patients were included in cohort A, 587 patients in cohort B, and 598 patients in cohort C. Over time, an increase in the use of immunomodulators [8.1%, 22.8% and 21.7%, respectively, p < 0.01] and biological agents [0%, 4.3% and 10.6%, respectively, p < 0.01] was observed. The early colectomy rate decreased from 1.5% in cohort A to 0.5% in cohort B [HR 0.14; 95% confidence interval 0.04-0.47], with no further decrease in cohort C [0.3%, HR 0.98; 95% confidence interval 0.20-4.85]. Late colectomy rate remained unchanged over time [4.0% vs 5.2% vs 3.6%, respectively, p = 0.54]. Hospitalisation rate was also similar among cohorts [22.3% vs 19.5% vs 18.3%, respectively, p = 0.10]. CONCLUSION: Over the past two decades, a reduction in early colectomy rate was observed, with no further reduction in the most recent era. Late colectomy rate and hospitalisation rate remained unchanged over time.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Medical treatment options and strategies for Crohn's disease (CD) have changed over the past decades. To assess its impact, we studied the evolution of the long-term disease outcome in the Dutch Inflammatory Bowel Disease South Limburg (IBDSL) cohort. METHODS: In total, 1,162 CD patients were included. Three eras were distinguished: 1991-1998 (n=316), 1999-2005 (n=387), and 2006-2011 (n=459), and patients were followed until 2014. Medication exposure and the rates of hospitalization, surgery, and phenotype progression were estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and compared between eras by multivariable Cox regression models. Second, propensity score matching was used to assess the relation between medication use and the long-term outcome. RESULTS: Over time, the immunomodulator exposure rate increased from 30.6% in the era 1991-1998 to 70.8% in the era 2006-2011 at 5 years. Similar, biological exposure increased from 3.1% (era 1991-1998) to 41.2% (era 2006-2011). In parallel, the hospitalization rate attenuated from 65.9% to 44.2% and the surgery rate from 42.9% to 17.4% at 5 years, respectively (both P<0.01). Progression to a complicated phenotype has not changed over time (21.2% in the era 1991-1998 vs. 21.3% in the era 2006-2011, P=0.93). Immunomodulator users had a similar risk of hospitalization, surgery, or phenotype progression as propensity score-matched nonusers (P>0.05 for all analyses). Similar results were found for biological users (P>0.05 for all analyses). CONCLUSIONS: Between 1991 and 2014, the hospitalization and surgery rates decreased, whereas progression to complicated disease is still common in CD. These improvements were not significantly related to the use of immunomodulators and biologicals.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elderly onset (EO) inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may become a more common entity as a result of population aging and the rising IBD incidence. Its management is challenging, because of multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and frailty. Insight into the long-term outcome is essential for optimal patient counseling and treatment. We studied the incidence and disease outcome of elderly-onset IBD in direct comparison to adult-onset (AO) IBD. METHODS: All 2823 cases with IBD from the Dutch population-based IBD South Limburg cohort, diagnosed between 1991 and 2011, were included. Long-term outcome (hospitalization, surgery, and disease phenotype) was compared between AO (<60 years at diagnosis) and EO (>/=60 years at diagnosis) disease, for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) separately. RESULTS: In total, 1162 patients with CD (136 EO/1026 AO) and 1661 patients with UC (373 EO/1288 AO) were included. The EO IBD incidence increased from 11.71 per 100,000 persons in 1991 to 23.66 per 100,000 persons in 2010, P < 0.01. Immunomodulators were less often used in EO CD (61.8% versus 77.1%, P = 0.03) and EO UC (22.8% versus 35.4%, P < 0.01), even as biologicals (25.1% versus 55.1%, P = 0.03 and 7.8% versus 18.0%, P < 0.01, respectively). No differences were observed in surgery risk (CD: hazard ratio [HR] 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-1.67 and UC: HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.53-1.46), or in CD phenotype progression (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.52-1.25), but more patients with EO UC required hospitalization (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.01-1.63). CONCLUSIONS: EO IBD is rising, warranting physicians' alertness for IBD in elderly patients. The long-term outcome was not different from AO disease, despite a less frequent use of immunomodulators and biologicals.},

   abstract = {Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare progressive disorder leading to bile duct destruction; approximately 75% of patients have comorbid inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We undertook the largest genome-wide association study of PSC (4,796 cases and 19,955 population controls) and identified four new genome-wide significant loci. The most associated SNP at one locus affects splicing and expression of UBASH3A, with the protective allele (C) predicted to cause nonstop-mediated mRNA decay and lower expression of UBASH3A. Further analyses based on common variants suggested that the genome-wide genetic correlation (rG) between PSC and ulcerative colitis (UC) (rG = 0.29) was significantly greater than that between PSC and Crohn's disease (CD) (rG = 0.04) (P = 2.55 x 10-15). UC and CD were genetically more similar to each other (rG = 0.56) than either was to PSC (P < 1.0 x 10-15). Our study represents a substantial advance in understanding of the genetics of PSC.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a heterogeneous group of chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal conditions with variable disease courses often requiring significant healthcare expenditures. We aimed to identify disease trajectory patterns based on longitudinal financial expenditures and to assess the association of classic disease activity parameters with financial charges. METHODS: This was an analysis of a consented, prospective, natural history IBD registry (2009-2013) from a tertiary IBD center of 2,203 patients and their associated medical charges excluding pharmacy expenses. We applied group-based trajectory modeling to longitudinal healthcare financial charges to determine patterns of charges. We assessed the association between charge patterns and disease activity, quality of life, healthcare utilization, and medication requirement. RESULTS: The final model included 1,600 IBD patients with 5-year charges. We identified six distinct trajectories over the study period. Consistently High charges were associated with Crohn's disease (66.0% Consistently High patients, P<0.01), perianal involvement (22.6%, P<0.01), ulcerative colitis extent (89.7% extensive, P=0.01), prior IBD surgery (52.5%, P<0.01), and depression/anxiety (36.2%, P<0.01). Compared with other trajectories, Consistently High charges had higher 5-year disease activity indices (Harvey-Bradshaw P<0.01; ulcerative colitis activity index P<0.01), elevated C-reactive protein rates (72.3%, P<0.01), IBD surgery (64.5%, P<0.01), hospitalization (97.2%, P<0.01), corticosteroid (70.9%, P<0.01) and antitumor necrosis factor requirement (50.4%, P<0.01), and worse quality of life (P<0.01). Annual trends in parameters were reflected in temporal changes in financial charges. The majority of financial burden stemmed from inpatient care. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare financial charges represent a novel phenotype in IBD that reflect trends in classic disease activity parameters and allow for subgroup identification of temporal disease trajectories.},

   abstract = {OPINION STATEMENT: A substantial and growing proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are elderly, and these patients require tailored treatment strategies. However, significant challenges exist in the management of this population due to the paucity of data. Establishing the initial diagnosis and assessing the etiology of future symptoms and flares can be challenging as several other prevalent diseases can masquerade as IBD, such as ischemic colitis, diverticular disease, and infectious colitis. Important pharmacologic considerations include reduced glomerular filtration rate and drug-drug interactions in the elderly. No drug therapy is absolutely contraindicated in this population; however, special risk and benefit assessments should be made. Older patients are more susceptible to side effects of steroids such as delirium, fractures, and cataracts. Budesonide can be an appropriate alternative for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) as it has limited systemic absorption. Pill size and quantity, nephrotoxicity, and difficulty of administration of rectal preparations should be considered with 5-aminosalicylic (5-ASA) therapy. Biologics are very effective, but modestly increase the risk of infection in a susceptible group. Based on their mechanisms, integrin receptor antagonists (e.g., vedolizumab) may reduce these risks. Use of antibiotics for anorectal or fistulizing CD or pouchitis in UC increases the risk of Clostridium difficile infection. Pre-existing comorbidities, functional status, and nutrition are important indicators of surgical outcomes. Morbidity and mortality are increased among IBD patients undergoing surgery, often due to postoperative complications or sepsis. Elderly adults with IBD, particularly UC, have very high rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Colonoscopy appears safe, but the optimal surveillance interval has not been well defined. Should the octogenarian, nonagenarian, and centurion undergo colonoscopy? The length of surveillance should likely account for the individual's overall life expectancy. Specific health maintenance should emphasize administering non-live vaccines to patients on thiopurines or biologics and regular skin exams for those on thiopurines. Smoking cessation is crucial to overall health and response to medical therapy, even among UC patients. This article will review management of IBD in the elderly.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Symptoms compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are common in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in clinical remission. It has been suggested that these symptoms might arise due to post-inflammatory changes comparable with post-infectious IBS. The aim was to study factors at new onset of UC that predict development of IBS-like symptoms during clinical remission. METHODS: In total, 98 patients with new onset of UC were followed prospectively for 3 years with yearly follow-up visits. Data from the first visit at the onset of UC were compared between a group of patients who fulfilled the criteria for IBS while in remission (UCR+IBS) during follow-up and a group who did not (UCR-IBS). RESULTS: Among the UC patients, 87 met the criteria for clinical remission and 25 (29%) of these reported IBS-like symptoms in remission during follow-up. There was no difference in inflammatory disease activity at the initial flare or in the prevalence of previous IBS symptoms when comparing UCR+IBS and UCR-IBS patients. The UCR+IBS patients reported more severe gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, during their primary flare. CONCLUSION: The severity and extent of inflammation at onset of UC do not seem to affect the development of IBS-like symptoms in UC patients during clinical remission. The high prevalence of IBS-like symptoms is not explained by pre-existing IBS. UCR+IBS patients reported more severe gastrointestinal symptoms at disease onset, which might indicate a more sensitive gastrointestinal tract in this category of patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) has been used for over a decade worldwide. Less is known about the natural history of IFX use beyond a few years and which patients are more likely to sustain benefits. METHODS: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) exposed to IFX from Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, and the Swiss IBD Cohort Study were identified through retrospective and prospective data collection, complemented by chart abstraction of electronic medical records. We compared long-term users of IFX (>5 yr of treatment, long-term users of infliximab [LTUI]), with non-LTUI patients to identify prognostic factors. RESULTS: We pooled data on 1014 patients with CD from 3 different databases, of whom 250 were defined as LTUI. The comparison group comprised 290 patients with CD who discontinued IFX: 48 primary nonresponses, 95 loss of responses, and 147 adverse events. Factors associated with LTUI were colonic involvements and an earlier age at the start of IFX. The prevalence of active smokers and obese patients differed markedly, but inversely, between American and European centers but did not impact outcome. The discontinuation rate was stable around 3% to 6%, each year from years 3 to 10. CONCLUSIONS: Young age at start of IFX and colonic CD are factors associated with a beneficial long-term use of IFX. After 5 years of IFX, there is still a 3% to 5% discontinuation rate annually. Several factors associated with a good initial response such as nonsmoker and shorter disease duration at IFX initiation do not seem associated with a longer term response.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is commonly used to treat pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Meta-analysis of pediatric studies that have compared the effect of EEN with other treatments have shown that EEN induces remission in up to 80-85% of patients. We aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the effect of EEN on the microbiota of CD patients. METHODS: We used 16S rRNA gene and whole-genome high throughout sequencing to determine changes in the fecal microbiota of five CD children, before, during, and after EEN therapy and compared this with five healthy controls. RESULTS: The microbial diversity observed in CD patients tended to be lower than that in controls (CD: 2.25+/-0.24, controls: 2.75+/-0.14, P=0.11). In all CD patients, dysbiosis was observed prior to therapy. EEN therapy had a positive effect in all patients, with 80% going into remission. In some patients, the positive effect diminished following the conclusion of EEN therapy. Significantly, the number of operational taxonomic units (OTU) decreased dramatically upon starting EEN and this corresponded with CD remission. Recurrence of CD corresponded with an increase in OTUs. Six families within the Firmicutes were found to correlate with disease activity during and following EEN therapy, a finding that was confirmed by whole-genome high throughput sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that EEN leads to common and patient-specific alterations in the microbiota of CD patients, a number of which correlate with disease activity.},

Prospective data evaluating the association of vitamin D serum status and disease course are lacking. We sought to determine the relationship between vitamin D status and clinical course of IBD over a multiyear time period. METHODS: IBD patients with up to 5-year follow-up from a longitudinal IBD natural history registry were included. Patients were categorized according to their mean serum 25-OH vitamin D level. IBD clinical status was approximated with patterns of medication use, health-care utilization, biochemical markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)), pain and clinical disease activity scores, and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 965 IBD patients (61.9% Crohn's disease, 38.1% ulcerative colitis) formed the study population (mean age 44 years, 52.3% female). Among them, 29.9% had low mean vitamin D levels. Over the 5-year study period, subjects with low mean vitamin D required significantly more steroids, biologics, narcotics, computed tomography scans, emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and surgery compared with subjects with normal mean vitamin D levels (P<0.05). Moreover, subjects with low vitamin D levels had worse pain, disease activity scores, and quality of life (P<0.05). Finally, subjects who received vitamin D supplements had a significant reduction in their health-care utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Low vitamin D levels are common in IBD patients and are associated with higher morbidity and disease severity, signifying the potential importance of vitamin D monitoring and treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Loss of response (LOR) to infliximab (IFX) has become an important clinical issue for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Elemental diet (ED) therapy has been established as a nutrition therapy for CD in Japan. ED therapy can reduce antigen exposure and is both efficacious and safe. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of concomitant ED therapy in maintaining regular IFX infusion in patients with CD. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 125 patients with luminal CD treated with scheduled IFX maintenance therapy with a regular dosage. Patients were classified into two groups: the ED group with intake >/= 900 kcal/day and the non-ED group with intake <900 kcal/day. When clinical LOR was detected on the basis of disease activity, laboratory parameters, or endoscopic findings, the physician discontinued the infusion schedule of IFX. We investigated the efficacy of ED therapy for sustaining the scheduled IFX maintenance therapy. RESULTS: With the exception of ED intake, no significant differences were found in patient characteristics between the ED group and the non-ED group. The ED group was significantly superior to the non-ED group (p = 0.049) in sustaining scheduled IFX maintenance therapy. It is well known that ED therapy is more effective for small bowel lesions than colonic lesions in CD. When comparing ileitis and ileocolitis patients with CD, the ED group was significantly superior to the non-ED group (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant ED therapy is effective in maintaining scheduled IFX maintenance therapy in patients with luminal CD in order to prevent LOR.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The most prevalent inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Immune processes play a vital role in the etiopathogenesis of these conditions, involving both cellular and humoral response mechanisms. The aim of this study was to quantify CD40- and CD80-positive cells in the biopsy specimens of large intestinal mucosa from children with IBD. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The study comprised 38 children aged between 3-17 years (mean 11.5+/-3.7 years) - 20 boys (52.6 %) and 18 girls (47.4%). Eighteen patients were diagnosed with UC on the basis of clinical manifestation, endoscopic and histopathological findings. Mean age of this subgroup was 11.55+/-4.07 years. A group of 10 children (mean age 12.30+/-2.83) diagnosed with CD was also included. The control group comprised 10 IBD-free children (mean age 10.28+/-4.07 years). The surface expressions of CD40 and CD80 were analyzed in large intestine mucosa biopsy specimens, fixed in formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cut with a microtome into 4 microm slices. RESULTS: The number of CD40- and CD80-positive cells in the large intestinal mucosa of children with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis was significantly higher than in the controls. The highest number of CD40+ and CD80+ cells was observed in the caecal mucosal membrane of Crohn's disease patients and in the rectal mucosa of individuals with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSION: IBD is characterized by elevated, segment-specific, expression of CD40 and CD80.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] presenting in early childhood is extremely rare. More recently, progress has been made to identify children with monogenic forms of IBD predominantly presenting very early in life. In this study, we describe the heterogeneous phenotypes and genotypes of patients with IBD presenting before the age of 2 years and establish phenotypic features associated with underlying monogenicity. METHODS: Phenotype data of 62 children with disease onset before the age of 2 years presenting over the past 20 years were reviewed. Children without previously established genetic diagnosis were prospectively recruited for next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: In all, 62 patients [55% male] were identified. The median disease onset was 3 months of age (interquartile range [IQR]: 1 to 11). Conventional IBD classification only applied to 15 patients with Crohn's disease [CD]-like [24%] and three with ulcerative colitis [UC]-like [5%] phenotype; 44 patients [71%] were diagnosed with otherwise unclassifiable IBD. Patients frequently required parenteral nutrition [40%], extensive immunosuppression [31%], haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation [29%], and abdominal surgery [19%]. In 31% of patients, underlying monogenic diseases were established [EPCAM, IL10, IL10RA, IL10RB, FOXP3, LRBA, SKIV2L, TTC37, TTC7A]. Phenotypic features significantly more prevalent in monogenic IBD were: consanguinity, disease onset before the 6th month of life, stunting, extensive intestinal disease and histological evidence of epithelial abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: IBD in children with disease onset before the age of 2 years is frequently unclassifiable into Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, particularly treatment resistant, and can be indistinguishable from monogenic diseases with IBD-like phenotype.},

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, open-label study in pediatric patients with CD (n=78) from January 2007 to December 2011. The CD patients were divided into three groups according to disease severity (mild, moderate, and severe). Seventeen patients with severe CD received short-term partial enteral nutrition (SPEN) in addition to their general diet for 4 weeks after the induction of remission with medical treatment. This SPEN group was further divided into two groups by age (<13 years, >/=13 years). Nutritional parameters and Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores were analyzed at the initial enrollment and following 1 year of treatment for all groups. RESULTS: Nutritional status improved substantially after 1 year of treatment in the severe CD group. Nutritional status in the SPEN group improved considerably more than that in the non-SPEN group. Additionally, the <13-year-old group demonstrated better nutritional status improvement than the >/=13-year-old group. CONCLUSIONS: SPEN may be effective in pediatric patients with severe CD for improving nutritional status and moderating disease severity.},

   abstract = {Intestinal failure (IF) is a state in which the nutritional demands of the body are not met by the gastrointestinal absorptive surface. It is a long-recognized complication associated with short bowel syndrome, which results in malabsorption after significant resection of the intestine for many reasons or functional dysmotility. Etiologies have included Crohn's disease, vascular complications, and the effects of radiation enteritis, as well as the effects of intestinal obstruction, dysmotility, or congenital defects. While IF has been long-recognized, it has historically not been uniformly defined, which has made both recognition and management challenging. This review examines the previous definitions of IF as well as the newer definition and classification of IF and how it is essential to IF clinical guidelines.},

It is widely acknowledged that the damage of intestinal mucosal barrier or the disturbance of microorganism balance in the intestinal tract contributes greatly to the pathogenesis and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which mainly includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process that involves degradation of protein aggregates and damaged organelles for recycling. The roles of autophagy in the pathogenesis and progression of IBD have been increasingly studied. This present review mainly describes the roles of autophagy of Paneth cells, macrophages, and goblet cells in IBD, and finally, several potential therapeutic strategies for IBD taking advantage of autophagy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is one type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that has been speculated to share prognostic factors with the development of stroke. There is controversial information in the literature regarding the association between CD and stroke. The present cohort study estimated the risk of subsequent stroke among CD patients compared with matched comparison subjects drawn from a population-based dataset in Taiwan. METHOD: This study drew data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database to conduct a historical cohort study. The study cohort comprised 3309 CD patients, and the comparison cohort comprised 13,236 subjects without an IBD. Cox proportional hazards regressions were performed to estimate the risk of subsequent stroke during the follow-up period. We also conducted additional analyses stratifying by age group and gender. RESULTS: After adjusting for selected medical co-morbidities and recent prescriptions of selected pharmaceuticals, the hazard ratio (HR) for subsequent stroke among patients with CD was found to be 1.911 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.65-2.22) that of comparison subjects. While we did not detect an association between stroke and CD among patients aged 30-40 years, we did detect increased risks for stroke among CD patients aged 40-50 years (HR = 2.29) and those aged over 50 years (HR = 1.88). We also found women (HR = 2.39) to be at a greater risk than men (HR = 1.50). CONCLUSION: This study reports an increased HR for subsequent stroke among CD patients when compared to matched comparison patients without IBD in an Asian population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oral manifestations are common in Crohn's disease (CD). Here we characterized the subgingival microbiota in pediatric patients with CD initiating therapy and after 8 weeks to identify microbial community features associated with CD and therapy. METHODS: Pediatric patients with CD were recruited from The Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania. Healthy control subjects were recruited from primary care or orthopedics clinic. Subgingival plaque samples were collected at initiation of therapy and after 8 weeks. Treatment exposures included 5-ASAs, immunomodulators, steroids, and infliximab. The microbiota was characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The study was repeated in separate discovery (35 CD, 43 healthy) and validation cohorts (43 CD, 31 healthy). RESULTS: Most subjects in both cohorts demonstrated clinical response after 8 weeks of therapy (discovery cohort 88%, validation cohort 79%). At week 0, both antibiotic exposure and disease state were associated with differences in bacterial community composition. Seventeen genera were identified in the discovery cohort as candidate biomarkers, of which 11 were confirmed in the validation cohort. Capnocytophaga, Rothia, and TM7 were more abundant in CD relative to healthy controls. Other bacteria were reduced in abundance with antibiotic exposure among CD subjects. CD-associated genera were not enriched compared with healthy controls after 8 weeks of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival microbial community structure differed with CD and antibiotic use. Results in the discovery cohort were replicated in a separate validation cohort. Several potentially pathogenic bacterial lineages were associated with CD but were not diminished in abundance by antibiotic treatment, suggesting targets for additional surveillance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD), IBD diagnosed at 5 years of age or younger, frequently presents with a different and more severe phenotype than older-onset IBD. We investigated whether patients with VEO-IBD carry rare or novel variants in genes associated with immunodeficiencies that might contribute to disease development. METHODS: Patients with VEO-IBD and parents (when available) were recruited from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from March 2013 through July 2014. We analyzed DNA from 125 patients with VEO-IBD (age, 3 wk to 4 y) and 19 parents, 4 of whom also had IBD. Exome capture was performed by Agilent SureSelect V4, and sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Alignment to human genome GRCh37 was achieved followed by postprocessing and variant calling. After functional annotation, candidate variants were analyzed for change in protein function, minor allele frequency less than 0.1%, and scaled combined annotation-dependent depletion scores of 10 or less. We focused on genes associated with primary immunodeficiencies and related pathways. An additional 210 exome samples from patients with pediatric IBD (n = 45) or adult-onset Crohn's disease (n = 20) and healthy individuals (controls, n = 145) were obtained from the University of Kiel, Germany, and used as control groups. RESULTS: Four hundred genes and regions associated with primary immunodeficiency, covering approximately 6500 coding exons totaling more than 1 Mbp of coding sequence, were selected from the whole-exome data. Our analysis showed novel and rare variants within these genes that could contribute to the development of VEO-IBD, including rare heterozygous missense variants in IL10RA and previously unidentified variants in MSH5 and CD19. CONCLUSIONS: In an exome sequence analysis of patients with VEO-IBD and their parents, we identified variants in genes that regulate B- and T-cell functions and could contribute to pathogenesis. Our analysis could lead to the identification of previously unidentified IBD-associated variants.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Family history provides important information on risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], and genetic profiling of first-degree relatives [FDR] of Crohn's disease [CD]- affected individuals might provide additional information. We aimed to delineate the genetic contribution to the increased IBD susceptibility observed in FDR. METHODS: N = 976 Caucasian, healthy, non-related FDR; n = 4997 independent CD; and n = 5000 healthy controls [HC]; were studied. Genotyping for 158 IBD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] was performed using the Illumina Immunochip. Risk allele frequency [RAF] differences between FDR and HC cohorts were correlated with those between CD and HC cohorts. CD and IBD genetic risk scores [GRS] were calculated and compared between HC, FDR, and CD cohorts. RESULTS: IBD-associated SNP RAF differences in FDR and HC cohorts were strongly correlated with those in CD and HC cohorts, correlation coefficient 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53 - 0.72), p = 9.90 x 10(-19). There was a significant increase in CD-GRS [mean] comparing HC, FDR, and CD cohorts: 0.0244, 0.0250, and 0.0257 respectively [p < 1.00 x 10(-7) for each comparison]. There was no significant difference in the IBD-GRS between HC and FDR cohorts [p = 0.81]; however, IBD-GRS was significantly higher in CD compared with FDR and HC cohorts [p < 1.00 x 10(-10) for each comparison]. CONCLUSION: FDR of CD-affected individuals are enriched with IBD risk alleles compared with HC. Cumulative CD-specific genetic risk is increased in FDR compared with HC. Prospective studies are required to determine if genotyping would facilitate better risk stratification of FDR.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Genetics, Environmental, Microbial Project is a multicenter study assessing etiological factors in Crohn's disease by studying healthy first-degree relatives (FDRs) of individuals affected by Crohn's disease. We aimed to evaluate the contribution of genetic, microbial, and environmental factors to the determination of intestinal permeability in healthy FDRs. METHODS: IP was assessed using the lactulose-mannitol ratio (LacMan ratio). FDRs were genotyped for 167 inflammatory bowel disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. Taxonomic profile of the fecal microbiota was determined by Illumina MiSeq pyrosequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA. The associations of LacMan ratio with demographic factors, inflammatory bowel disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms and the fecal microbiota were assessed. RESULTS: One thousand, one hundred ninety-six white FDRs were included [corrected]. Eleven percent of FDRs had an elevated LacMan ratio (>/=0.03). A multivariate analysis demonstrated that younger subjects and nonsmokers had higher LacMan ratios, P = 3.62 x 10(-)(4) and P = 0.03, respectively. The LacMan ratio was not significantly heritable, H2r, 0.13, P = 0.13. There was no association between any of the 167 inflammatory bowel disease-associated risk variants and LacMan ratio nor was there a correlation between fecal microbial composition and the LacMan ratio. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find LacMan ratio to be significantly heritable suggesting that the contribution of genetic factors to the determination of intestinal permeability in healthy FDRs is modest. Environmental factors, such as smoking, are likely more important determinants. The effect of age on intestinal barrier function has been underappreciated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with intestinal-specific inflammation. Nonetheless, a specific role of obesity in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is unclear. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of U.S. women enrolled in 1989 in the Nurses' Health Study II. At baseline, we collected information on height, weight, waist and hip circumference, weight at age 18, and body shape at age 20. We used Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 111,498 women (median age, 35 yr), we documented 153 cases of Crohn's disease (CD) and 229 cases of ulcerative colitis (UC) more than 18 years of follow-up, encompassing 2,028,769 person-years. Compared with women with normal BMI, the multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios of CD were 2.33 (95% CI, 1.15-4.69) for obese women at age 18 and 1.58 (95% CI, 1.01-2.47) for obese women at baseline. Increasing weight gain between age 18 and baseline was associated with increased risk of CD (Ptrend = 0.04). Adolescent body habitus was also associated with risk of CD with a multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio of CD of 1.63 (95% CI, 1.07-2.50) for women with overweight/obese body shape compared with women with a thin/slender body shape. We did not observe a significant association between any of these anthropometric measures and risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: In a large prospective cohort of U.S. women, measures of adiposity were associated with an increased risk of CD but not UC. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the biological mechanisms by which excess adiposity may increase the risk of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Androgens, which are known to be altered by exogenous hormone use, have recently been linked to alterations of the gut microbiome and mucosal immune function. No study has evaluated the association between circulating levels of androgens and risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study and Nurses' Health Study II who provided a blood specimen. Cases of CD and UC were each matched to 2 controls. Prediagnosis plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin were measured. We examined the association of each analyte with risk of CD or UC using conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: Compared with women in the lowest quintile of testosterone, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratios for CD were 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.39-1.90) for women in the second quintile, 0.49 (95% confidence interval, 0.21-1.15) for the third quartile, 0.22 (0.08-0.65) for the fourth quintile, and 0.39 (95% confidence interval, 0.16-0.99) for the highest quintile (Plinear trend = 0.004). In contrast, we did not observe a consistent association between prediagnostic testosterone and risk of UC (Plinear trend = 0.84). We also did not observe any association between plasma levels of sex hormone-binding globulin or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and risk of UC or CD (all Plinear trends > 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Among women, prediagnostic circulating testosterone is associated with a lower risk of CD but not UC. Further studies to understand the biological mechanisms by which endogenous androgens may mediate the etiopathogenesis of CD are warranted.},

   abstract = {Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have separately identified many genetic susceptibility loci for ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and colorectal cancer (CRC), there has been no large-scale examination for pleiotropy, or shared genetic susceptibility, for these conditions. We used logistic regression modeling to examine the associations of 181 UC and CD susceptibility variants previously identified by GWAS with risk of CRC using data from the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium and the Colon Cancer Family Registry. We also examined associations of significant variants with clinical and molecular characteristics in a subset of the studies. Among 11794 CRC cases and 14190 controls, rs11676348, the susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for UC, was significantly associated with reduced risk of CRC (P = 7E-05). The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio of CRC with each copy of the T allele was 0.93 (95% CI 0.89-0.96). The association of the SNP with risk of CRC differed according to mucinous histological features (P heterogeneity = 0.008). In addition, the (T) allele was associated with lower risk of tumors with Crohn's-like reaction but not tumors without such immune infiltrate (P heterogeneity = 0.02) and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-high) but not microsatellite stable or MSI-low tumors (P heterogeneity = 0.03). The minor allele (T) in SNP rs11676348, located downstream from CXCR2 that has been implicated in CRC progression, is associated with a lower risk of CRC, particularly tumors with a mucinous component, Crohn's-like reaction and MSI-high. Our findings offer the promise of risk stratification of inflammatory bowel disease patients for complications such as CRC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent animal studies have identified that dietary salt intake may modify the risk and progression of autoimmune disorders through modulation of the IL-23/TH17 pathway, which is critical in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of U.S. women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and NHSII who provided detailed and validated information on diet and lifestyle beginning in 1984 in NHS and 1991 in NHSII. We confirmed incident cases of UC and CD reported through 2010 in NHS and 2011 in NHSII. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. In a case-control study nested within these cohorts, we evaluated the interaction between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in TH17 pathway and dietary potassium on risk of CD and UC. In a cohort of healthy volunteers, we also assessed the effect of supplemental potassium on development of naive and memory T cells, differentiated with TGFbeta1 or TH17 conditions. RESULTS: Among a total of 194,711 women over a follow-up of 3,220,247 person-years, we documented 273 cases of CD and 335 cases of UC. Dietary intake of potassium (Ptrend = 0.005) but not sodium (Ptrend = 0.44) was inversely associated with risk of CD. Although, both dietary potassium and sodium were not significantly associated with risk of UC, there was a suggestion of an inverse association with dietary potassium (Ptrend = 0.08). The association of potassium with risk of CD and UC appeared to be modified by loci involved in the TH17 pathway that have previously been associated with susceptibility to CD, particularly SNP rs7657746 (IL21) (Pinteraction = 0.004 and 0.01, respectively). In vitro, potassium enhanced the expression of Foxp3 in both naive and memory CD4+ T cells via activating Smad2/3 and inhibiting Smad7 in TH17 cells. CONCLUSION: Dietary potassium is inversely associated with risk of CD with both in vitro and gene-environment interaction data suggesting a potential role for potassium in regulating immune tolerance through its effect on Tregs and TH17 pathway.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Association of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) and Crohn's disease (CD) has been controversial due to contradictory reports. Therefore, we determined the prevalence of MAP in patients with CD and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) and its association with clinical course. METHODOLOGY: Blood and intestinal biopsies were taken from 69 CD, 32 ITB patients and 41 patients with haemorrhoidal bleed who served as controls. qPCR targeting of MAP-specific IS900 gene was used to detect the presence of MAP DNA. qPCR results were further validated by sequencing. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the presence of MAP antigen in biopsy specimens. CD and ITB patients were followed-up for disease course and response to therapy. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The frequency of MAP-specific DNA in biopsies by qPCR was significantly higher in CD patients (23.2%, p = 0.03) as compared to controls (7.3%). No significant difference in intestinal MAP presence was observed between ITB patients (12.5%, p = 0.6) and controls (7.3%). MAP presence in blood of CD patients was 10.1% as compared to 4.9% in controls while no patients with ITB were found to be positive (p = 0.1). Using IHC for detection of MAP antigen, the prevalence of MAP in CD was 2.9%, 12.5% in ITB patients and 2.4% in controls. However, long-term follow-up of the patients revealed no significant associations between clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes with MAP positivity. CONCLUSION: We report significantly high prevalence of MAP in intestinal biopsies of CD patients. However, the presence of MAP does not affect the disease course and treatment outcomes in either CD or ITB patients.},

   abstract = {Among the neoplasias, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in men and women. The increasing incidence of this type of cancer is due to the increase in the population's life expectancy, by the increase in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and the change in eating habits. The American Cancer Society (2011) shows that diet might be responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in developed countries, moreover when considering only colorectal cancer, the number can reach 30% to 50%. Probiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of many bowel diseases as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, gluten intolerance, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pyloriinfection, and colon cancer. Classical examples are strains from the Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacteriumgenus that have probiotic proprieties with a potential use in the prophylaxis, as well as in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal tract disorders. Researchers are focusing on extremely important studies regarding the possibility of using probiotics to promote a balanced microbiota composition, and a sufficient immunological surveillance system as a way to prevent cancer. Considering the fact that the human intestines host 100 trillion bacteria, including more than 1,000 species, there is still need to perform more in depth investigations in order to find probiotics with potential to prevent, and treat cancerous diseases, adding a very promising effect to this already successful panorama. This revision aims to conduct a review of the most recent studies correlating probiotics and its cancer preventing and treatment potential.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy and safety of 2 protocols of maintenance therapy with infliximab (IFX) and an immunomodulatory agent in pediatric patients with Crohn disease (CD): withdrawal of immunomodulators versus continuation of immunosuppressants. METHODS: The present multicenter randomized open-label trial included 99 patients with CD (ages 14.5 +/- 2.6 years) who were administered IFX (5 mg/kg body weight) along with an immunomodulatory agent (azathioprine 1.5-3 mg/kg body weight per day, methotrexate 10-25 mg/week). After 10 weeks of the induction therapy, 84 responders were centrally randomized into 1 of the following groups: group I (n = 45) in which IFX and an immunomodulatory agent were continued up to week 54 and group II (n = 39) in which the immunomodulatory agent was discontinued after 26 weeks. RESULTS: The induction therapy was reflected by a significant decrease in Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and Simplified Endoscopic Activity Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) values. After the maintenance phase, the analyzed groups did not differ significantly in terms of the clinical response loss rates and final PCDAI and SES-CD scores. Furthermore, no significant intragroup differences were documented between mean PCDAI scores determined at the end of induction and maintenance phases. Intensification/modification of the treatment was required in 13 of 45 (29%) and 11 of 39 (28%) patients of groups I and II, respectively. A total of 9 serious adverse events were documented; none of the patients died during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-six weeks likely represent the safe duration of combined IFX/immunomodulatory therapy in our sample of pediatric patients with CD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) therapy effectively induces clinical remission in Crohn's disease (CD). It remains unclear, however, whether partial enteral nutrition (PEN) can maintain remission. This study was performed to determine the abilities of oral EEN and oral PEN to induce and maintain clinical remission in pediatric patients with CD, respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pediatric patients with CD who received oral EEN at a single center in 2000-2014 were identified retrospectively. Remission rates of the EEN and PEN during the 2 years study period were determined. Risk factors for EEN and PEN failure were identified. RESULTS: Of the 66 patients who started EEN, 61 (92%) completed the course. Clinical remission was achieved in 88% (58/66) of the patients. All 58 patients with remission continued with PEN: 43 (74%) were treatment adherent. The cumulative remission rates at 1 and 2 years were 67% and 52%, respectively. Differing from EEN, limited therapeutic efficacy of PEN was shown in severe CD patients. Female gender associated significantly with non-adherence. CONCLUSION: Oral EEN and PEN effectively induced and maintained remission in a pediatric population. Non-adherence was a limiting factor in the success of therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, involves chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Previously, Sasa quelpaertensis leaves have been shown to mediate anti-inflammation and anti-cancer effects, although it remains unclear whether Sasa leaves are able to attenuate inflammation-related intestinal diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of Sasa quelpaertensis leaf extract (SQE) using an in vitro co-culture model of the intestinal epithelial environment. MATERIALS/METHODS: An in vitro co-culture system was established that consisted of intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce inflammation. RESULTS: Treatment with SQE significantly suppressed the secretion of LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-6, and IL-1beta in co-cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages. In addition, expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were down-regulated in response to inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation by SQE. Compared with two bioactive compounds that have previously been identified in SQE, tricin and P-coumaric acid, SQE exhibited the most effective anti-inflammatory properties. CONCLUSIONS: SQE exhibited intestinal anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting various inflammatory mediators mediated through nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-kB) activation. Thus, SQE has the potential to ameliorate inflammation-related diseases, including IBD, by limiting excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diagnosis and monitoring of Crohn's disease (CD) is difficult and time-consuming. In recent years, diagnostic usefulness of fecal calprotectin has been proven. However, data on the utility of other fecal markers are scarce. AIMS: To evaluate the usefulness of fecal lactoferrin (FL) in the assessment of CD activity. METHODS: The group consisted of 101 CD patients (median age: 30 years, IQR: 24-37). FL was measured in a single stool sample by using the immunoenzymatic methods. The clinical activity of the disease was evaluated by using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Depending on the location of the disease, either a colonoscopy or magnetic resonance enterography was performed or both in order to evaluate the disease activity by using appropriate endoscopic and enterographic scores. RESULTS: Median FL concentration was 84.14 (IQR: 36.4-302.9) mug/ml and it correlated with C-reactive protein concentration (p=0.0000001, r=0.5), CDAI (p=0.002, r=0.3) and colonic Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) (p=0.000004, r=0.5). Assuming endoscopic remission in the large intestine with colonic SES-CD</=3 points, a ROC curve showed that FL concentration of 145.82 mug/ml had 84.6% sensitivity and 60.5% specificity in discriminating CD patients with endoscopically active and inactive disease [AUC: 0.676 (95% CI: 0.531-0.8), (p=0.0347)]. The positive predictive value for this concentration was 42% and negative predictive value -92%. CONCLUSIONS: FL is a sensitive marker of CD activity and it reliably reflects the mucosal inflammatory lesions in large intestine. Thus, it can be helpful in diagnostics and monitoring of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has become an established non-invasive, patient-friendly imaging technique which improves the characterization of lesions. In addition, dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US) provides valuable information concerning perfusion of examined organs. This review addresses current applications of CEUS in children, focused on DCE-US of the bowel wall in patients with Crohn disease, which enables realtime assessment of the bowel wall vascularity with semi-quantitative and quantitative assessment of disease activity and response to medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory relapsing disease. Frequent imaging re-evaluation is necessary. Therefore, imaging should be as little invasive as possible, children friendly with high diagnostic accuracy. US with wide varieties of techniques, including CEUS/DCE-US, can provide an important contribution for diagnosing and monitoring a disease activity. Even if the use of US contrast agent is off-label in children, it is welcome and widely accepted for intravesical use, and a little less for intravenous use, manly in evaluation of parenchymal lesions. To our knowledge this is the first time that the use of DCE-US in the evaluation of activity of small bowel Crohn disease with quantitative assessment of kinetic parameters is being described in children. Even if the results of the value and accuracy of different quantitative kinetic parameters in published studies in adult population often contradict one another there is a great potential of DCE-US to become a part of the entire sonographic evaluation not only in adults, but also in children. Further control studies should be performed.},

This study focused on MHC association of genes with pediatric-onset IBD and its different phenotypes. METHODS: Blood samples of 103 patients with pediatric IBD (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis) were collected at Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, Finland. HLA-A, -B, -DRB1 alleles and complement C4A and C4B gene copy numbers were determined and constructed into haplotypes by a Bayesian algorithm (PHASE). A general population cohort (n = 149) served as a control. HLA-alleles and C4 deficiency frequencies were compared between patients and controls with chi-squared and Fisher exact test with Bonferroni correction (Pcorr). RESULTS: One MHC haplotype HLA-A03; HLA-B07; 1 C4A gene; 1 C4B gene; HLA-DRB115 was more common in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis than in controls (7/61, 11.5%, 6/42, 14.3% and 1/149, 0.7%, respectively, odds ratio (OR) = 19.19, 95% CI 2.31-159.57, Pcorr = 0.004 for Crohn disease vs controls and OR = 24.67, 95% CI 2.88-211.36, Pcorr = 0.002 for ulcerative colitis vs controls). Two MHC markers were associated with clinical characteristics. HLA-DRB101 was more common in patients with milder disease course, that is, no need for anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha medication (18/32, 56.2% vs 19/71, 26.8% without and with anti-TNF-alpha medication, respectively, OR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.12-0.68, Pcorr = 0.032). C4B deficiency (<2 C4B genes) was associated with complicated recovery after surgery (12/16, 75.0% vs 4/16, 25.0%, respectively, OR = 9.00, 95% CI 1.82-44.59, Pcorr = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: One MHC haplotype is strongly linked with pediatric-onset IBD, whereas the need for immunomodulatory therapy and surgery outcome associates with other distinct MHC gene markers.},

BACKGROUND: Use of CT to assess patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in the Emergency Department (ED) is both costly and exposes patients to high levels of ionizing radiation while not clearly improving outcomes. STUDY: Patients with CD who underwent CT scan in the Emergency Department from 2008 to 2011 at a tertiary referral center were assessed for clinically significant findings. A multivariable generalized estimating equation model with logit link and exchangeable working correlation structure was constructed to assess for independent predictors of CT scans with clinically significant findings. RESULTS: A total of 118 patients with CD underwent 194 CT scans. Ninety-two of 194 (47%) CT scans demonstrated clinically significant findings. Predictors of clinically significant CT scans included ileal disease involvement [odds ratios (OR) 3.47, P=0.01] and white blood cell count >12 (OR 2.1, P=0.03). Most notably, patients with a CT scan without clinically significant findings performed in the preceding month were significantly less likely to have a clinically significant CT scan (OR 0.23, P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD who had a CT scan without significant findings the month prior are unlikely to have clinically significant CT findings. Ileal disease and an elevated white blood cell are predictive of clinically significant CT scans.},

Outcomes included short- and long-term clinical response, colectomy free rates, and rate of adverse events in randomised controlled trials [RCTs] and observational studies. RESULTS: Two RCTs comparing high trough concentration [10-15ng/ml] versus placebo [n = 103] and 23 observational studies [n = 831] were identified. Clinical response at 2 weeks was significantly higher with tacrolimus compared with placebo (risk ratio [RR] = 4.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.09-10.17, p = 0.15 x 10(-3)] among RCTs. Rates of clinical response at 1 and 3 months were 0.73 [95% CI = 0.64-0.81] and 0.76 [95% CI = 0.59-0.87], and colectomy-free rates remained high at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months [0.86, 0.84, 0.78, and 0.69, respectively] among observational studies. Among RCTs, adverse events were more frequent compared with placebo [RR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.20-3.37, p = 0.83 x 10(-2)], but there was no difference in severe adverse events [RR = 3.15, 95% CI = 0.14-72.9, p = 0.47]. Severe adverse events were rare among observational studies [0.11, 95% CI = 0.06-0.20]. CONCLUSIONS: In the present meta-analysis, tacrolimus was associated with high clinical response and colectomy-free rates without increased risk of severe adverse events for active UC.},

   abstract = {OPINION STATEMENT: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is an inflammatory cytokine that plays a major role during the initiation and perpetuation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Anti-TNF-alpha agents are the most widely used biologics that specifically target either or both circulating and membrane-bound TNF-alpha, thus preventing its pro-inflammatory activity. Despite their efficacy, one third of the patients receiving anti-TNF-alpha agents are primary non-responders and nearly half of the patients that initially respond may subsequently lose response (secondary loss of response). Many of these cases can be explained by immunogenicity, which can lead to lower drug levels associated with reduced response and serious adverse effects that cause patients to withdraw from treatment. New treatment algorithms instruct practitioners to check drug and antibody levels when there is loss of response, and then provide guidance towards either dose optimization and/or change in the biologic agent or class to help regain efficacy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-term effectiveness of enteral nutrition for maintaining remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) is poorly documented. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the long-term effectiveness of enteral nutrition with aminosalicylates as maintenance therapy for those in whom remission was primarily induced by total parenteral nutrition or exclusive enteral nutrition with aminosalicylates. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data for 58 pediatric patients with newly diagnosed CD during a median follow-up period of 50 months (range, 12-216 months). Data for remission-induced patients in whom enteral nutrition with aminosalicylates was used as maintenance therapy were analyzed with particular reference to time to first relapse and time to first intestinal surgery. RESULTS: Twenty-five (43.1%) of the patients relapsed with a median duration of remission of 32.4 months (range, 6-73.2 months). The cumulative rates of continuous remission were 0.88 (95%CI: 0.79-0.96) at 1 year, 0.73 (95%CI: 0.61-0.85) at 2 years, and 0.52 (95%CI: 0.35-0.68) at 5 years. None of the patients received corticosteroids, immunomodulators or anti-tumor necrosis factor agents until relapse. Disease location had no impact on timing of relapse, but with regard to disease behavior there was a trend towards earlier relapse in patients with penetrating type. Only six of the 58 patients (10.3%) needed intestinal surgery. There was a trend towards need for surgery in patients with ileal disease and with stricturing type. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutrition therapy with aminosalicylates is effective for maintaining remission and decreasing the rate of intestinal surgery in pediatric CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Anemia is a common manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can greatly affect patients' quality of life. We performed a prospective study of a large cohort of patients with IBD to determine if patterns of anemia over time are associated with aggressive or disabling disease. METHODS: We performed a longitudinal analysis of demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data from a registry of patients with IBD at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center from 2009 through 2013. Patients with a complete follow-up evaluation (at least 1 annual visit with laboratory results) were included. Anemia was defined by World Health Organization criteria. Disease activity scores (the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or the ulcerative colitis activity index) and quality-of-life scores (based on the short IBD questionnaire) were determined at each visit; laboratory data, including levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rates, as well as patterns of IBD-related health care use, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 410 IBD patients (245 with Crohn's disease, 165 with ulcerative colitis; 50.5% female) were included. The prevalence of anemia in patients with IBD was 37.1% in 2009 and 33.2% in 2013. Patients with IBD and anemia required significantly more health care and had higher indices of disease activity, as well as a lower average quality of life, than patients without anemia (P < .0001). Anemia (persistent or recurrent) for 3 or more years was correlated independently with hospitalizations (P < .01), visits to gastroenterology clinics (P < .001), telephone calls (P < .004), surgeries for IBD (P = .01), higher levels of C-reactive protein (in patients with ulcerative colitis, P = .001), and a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P < .0001). Anemia was correlated negatively with quality-of-life scores (P < .03). CONCLUSIONS: Based on a longitudinal analysis of 410 patients, persistent or recurrent anemia correlates with more aggressive or disabling disease in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents are an important component of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment, but data on their influence on anemia, a frequent complication of IBD, are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of anti-TNF agents on hemoglobin (Hb) levels in a large IBD cohort. METHODS: Prospectively collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data from IBD patients who started anti-TNF treatment at a tertiary referral center during the years 2010 to 2012 were analyzed. Follow-up data including disease activity scores (Harvey-Bradshaw index or ulcerative colitis activity index), quality of life scores (short IBD questionnaire) completed at each visit, and laboratory data were analyzed. Data from the year of anti-TNF initiation (yr 0) to the following year (yr 1) were compared. RESULTS: A total of 430 IBD patients (324 with Crohn's disease, 51.6% females) started anti-TNF treatment. The prevalence of anemia and median Hb levels did not change between years 0 and 1. Median short IBD questionnaire was significantly improved at year 1 (P = 0.002). IBD patients with anemia had significantly higher median Hb levels at year 1 compared with year 0 (P = 0.0009). Hematopoietic response (increase of Hb >/=2 g/dL) was observed in only 33.6% of the 134 anemic IBD patients, despite iron replacement being administered in 126 anemic patients (oral, 77%). Improvement in Hb levels was independently significantly correlated with change of C-reactive protein levels (P = 0.04) and immunomodulator use (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Anemia remains a significant manifestation of IBD 1 year after treatment with anti-TNF agents.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but its prevalence in the United States is not well defined. Aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of anemia in IBD patients who were followed in a US referral center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data from a prospective, consented longitudinal IBD registry between the years 2009 and 2013 were analyzed. Disease activity was evaluated using Harvey-Bradshaw index in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) activity index in UC as well as C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Anemia was defined based on the World Health Organization criteria. RESULTS: A total of 1821 IBD patients (1077 with CD, 744 with UC, median age 43.8 y, 51.9% female) were included. The 5-year period prevalence of anemia in IBD patients was 50.1%, (CD: 53.3% vs. UC: 44.7%, P=0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, anemia was associated with surgery for IBD [odds ratio (OR)=2.77; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.21-3.48; P<0.0001], female gender (OR=1.29; 95% CI, 1.04-1.61; P=0.02), C-reactive protein (OR=1.26; 95% CI, 1.16-1.37; P<0.0001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OR=1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03; P=0.0002), and use of biologics (OR=2.00; 95% CI, 1.58-2.52; P=0.0001) or immunomodulators (OR=1.51; 95% CI, 1.21-1.87; P=0.0003). Iron replacement therapy was administered to 46.8% of the anemic patients. CONCLUSION: Anemia has a high period prevalence in IBD patients followed at a tertiary center. Anemia is more common in CD than in UC, is associated with disease activity, and in current practice is undertreated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been linked to an increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Dyslipidemia is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term lipid profiles in a large cohort of IBD patients. METHODS: Data of patients from an IBD registry who had more than one measurement of total cholesterol and triglyceride levels during the follow-up period were analyzed. The lipid profiles of IBD patients were compared to those of the general population according to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2009-2012). Quartiles of cholesterol or triglyceride levels in relation to surrogate markers of disease severity were analyzed. RESULTS: Seven hundred and one IBD patients [54% Crohn's disease (CD), 46% ulcerative colitis (UC)] were included. IBD patients had less frequent high total cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol (6 vs. 13 and 5 vs. 10%) and more frequent low HDL and high triglycerides (24 vs. 17 and 33 vs. 25%) compared to the general population (all p < 0.001). Median total cholesterol levels were lower and median triglycerides higher in CD compared to UC (171 vs. 184; 123 vs. 100 mg/dL; both p < 0.001). In the multiple regression analysis, lipid profile was independently associated with hospitalizations (low cholesterol) and IBD surgeries (low cholesterol and high triglycerides). CONCLUSIONS: Low total cholesterol and high triglyceride levels are more frequent in IBD patients (in particular CD) compared to healthy controls and are independently associated with more severe disease.},

   abstract = {Osteoporosis is more frequent in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. A reduction in bone mineral mass in these individuals is caused not only by inflammatory processes in the bowel, because osteoporosis occurs already in very young IBD patients and in newly diagnosed individuals who have not yet undergone any pharmacological treatment. One of individual determinants of the bone turnover parameters is osteoprotegerin (OPG) encoded by the TNFRSF11B gene. The c.-223C > T polymorphism in this gene has been extensively studied in post-menopausal osteoporosis patients. However, no such studies exist for osteoporosis related to IBD. The aim of our study was to determine whether the c.-223C > T (rs2073617) polymorphism in the 5'UTR region of the gene encoding osteoprotegerin is a functional polymorphism which may change the gene expression and resulting OPG levels, and so be associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis, and impaired bone metabolism in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. Our study included 198 IBD patients and 41 healthy controls. Lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density, T-score, Z-score as well as OPG, RANKL, vitamin D, calcium and interleukin 4 and 10 concentrations were determined for all study subjects. Genotyping of the TNFRSF11B polymorphic site was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Statistical analyses were conducted using Statistica software. Odds ratios, 95 % confidence intervals, and P values were calculated using the HWE calculator. Our results did not allow determining an unequivocal association between the polymorphic variants of the TNFRSF11B 5'UTR region and a susceptibility to osteoporosis in IBD patients. We have shown, however, that the c.-223T allele was twice as more frequent in Crohn's disease (CD) patients than among controls (OR = 1.99, P value = 0.009). Interestingly, average osteoprotegerin levels in CD patients did not significantly differ from those in controls, whereas in ulcerative colitis patients, OPG levels were significantly lower. We have concluded that low OPG levels may be associated with osteoporosis in ulcerative colitis, but it is not correlated with the c.-223C > T polymorphism in the TNFRSF11B gene. In CD patients, in turn, we observed increased RANKL levels. Our observations confirm different pathogeneses of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as well as different molecular backgrounds of osteoporosis associated with these two diseases.},

The gastroenterologist may come across osteoporosis or osteopenia in a patient with a gastrointestinal disease. This is often a young patient in whom investigations should be carried out and appropriate treatment initiated, aimed at preventing bone fractures and the formation of the best peak bone mass. Osteoporosis occurs in patients with the following conditions: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, post gastrectomy patients, patients with short bowel syndrome, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, treated with steroids (steroid-induced osteoporosis) and patients using proton pump inhibitors chronically (state of achlorhydria). It is therefore necessary to approve a list of risk factors of secondary osteoporosis, the presence of which would be an indication for screening for osteoporosis, including a DXA study and the development of a separate algorithm for the therapeutic management of secondary osteoporosis accompanying gastrointestinal diseases, especially in premenopausal young women and young men, because there are currently no registered drugs with proven antifracture activity for this group of patients.},

   abstract = {Etiological factors of bone metabolism disorders in inflammatory bowel diseases have been the subject of interest of many researchers. One of the questions often raised is vitamin D deficiency. Calcitriol acts on cells, tissues and organs through a vitamin D receptor. The result of this action is the multi-directional effect of vitamin D. The reasons for vitamin D deficiency are: decreased exposure to sunlight, inadequate diet, inflammatory lesions of the intestinal mucosa and post-gastrointestinal resection states. This leads not only to osteomalacia but also to osteoporosis. Of significance may be the effect of vitamin D on the course of the disease itself, through modulation of the inflammatory mechanisms. It is also necessary to pay attention to the role of vitamin D in skeletal pathology in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and thus take measures aimed at preventing and treating these disorders through the supplementation of vitamin D.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) promotes the development of osteopaenia/osteoporosis, the cytokine background of which is not fully known. AIM: Evaluation of bone mineral density (BMD), the prevalence of osteopaenia and osteoporosis, and the determination of the levels of selected interleukins (IL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and s-RANKL proteins in patients with CD in relation to a control group and assessment of the relationship between the tested cytokines, OPG, s-RANKL, and BMD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-seven CD patients and 37 healthy volunteers (control group) were enrolled into the study. Densitometry of the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and of the femoral neck using the DXA technique was carried out. Serum levels of: IL-13, IL-4, IL-17, IL-1beta, OPG, and s-RANKL were determined using the ELISA method. Progression-of-disease questionnaires were collected. RESULTS: The prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopaenia in the CD group was: 18.92% and 32.43% in L2-L4; 13.51% and 35.13% in the neck, respectively. The IL-13 and IL-1beta concentrations were significantly higher and OPG was significantly lower in CD patients when compared to controls. In the case of all subjects: IL-13 correlated negatively with the BMD of the neck, IL-17 correlated negatively with the Z-score of L2-L4, and OPG correlated negatively with the IL-13. In the case of CD patients, IL-4 correlated negatively with the BMD of L2-L4. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of osteopaenia and osteoporosis in Polish CD patients is high. IL-13, IL-1beta, and IL-4 seem to be connected with the pathology of decreased BMD in CD. It can be hypothesised that IL-13 may lower BMD by modulating OPG.},

Still there is a search for a perfect marker for this group of patients which would help in the diagnosis of the disease, in determinating its activity and in monitoring the treatment. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the usefulness of the application of calprotectin measurement in stool samples from children with IBD, as a marker of the severity of inflammation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed 156 patients: 58 with ulcerative colitis (UC), 67 with Crohn's disease (CD), and 31 from the control group. In all patients the concentration of calprotectin in the sample of feces, markers of inflammation and hemoglobin were measured. RESULTS: Concentration of calprotectin in feces of patients with IBD was above the normal range in all patients with moderate and severe disease and in the majority with mild disease or in remission, but it was normal in all patients from the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated concentration of fecal calprotectin (FC) was observed in the majority of patients with IBD, but in none from the control group. The number of patients with elevated FC concentration increased together with the disease activity. FC concentration was higher in patients with severe and moderate disease activity. FC concentration in patients with IBD was associated with the increase of inflammatory markers and decreased haemoglobin. Percentage of laboratory abnormalities in children with Crohn's disease and perianal changes was higher. FC concentration can be a noninvasive marker of disease activity in IBD.},

After a year of anticoagulation and compression therapy, although exacerbations of underlying disease occurred in the first 6 months of treatment, there was no recurrence of deep venous thrombosis, partial recanalization within affected venous system has been achieved and the patient is remission of ulcerative colitis for the last six months. CONCLUSIONS: In children, thromboembolic complications occur about 7 times less often than in adults, but increases in the case of hospitalized children. In children with IBD this complication can occur independently og disease activity even in patients with any other risk factors.},

Study. A group of 71 patients with CD and 52 individuals without a diagnosis of GI tract disease as a control group were investigated, considering clinical and histological severity of the disease and the severity of inflammatory changes in the bowel. Evaluation was conducted with the use of clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological indices. Endoscopic indices were then correlated with different clinical and histopathological indices with the aim of finding the strongest correlations. Results and Conclusions. Correlation between the clinical disease activity and the severity of endoscopic lesions in CD was shown in this study to be poor. The results also indicate that the optimal endoscopic index used in the diagnostic stage and in the assessment of treatment effects in CD is Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD).},

Animal models of experiment intestinal inflammation have been developed that leverage the development of spontaneous inflammation in certain mouse strains, e.g. Samp1/Yit mice, or induction of inflammation using gene-targeting e.g. IL-10 null mice, administration of exogenous agents e.g. DSS, or adoptive transfer of T-cells into immunodeficient mice, e.g. CD4(+) CD45Rb(Hi) T-cell transfer. Colitis induced by rectal instillation of the haptenizing agent, 2,4,6 trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, is one of the most commonly used and well-characterized models of Crohn's disease in humans.},

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of children with CD isolated to the terminal ileum undergoing operative intervention at Children's Hospital Colorado between 2002 and 2013. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients underwent ileocecetomy (mean age at diagnosis 14.1 +/- 2.6 years; mean age at resection 15.7 +/- 2.5 years; median follow-up 2 +/- 1.5 years). Twenty-two (84.6%) patients reported clinical improvement and 17 (65.4%) were able to decrease the number or dosage of medications. Average weight increased from the 29th to the 45th percentile (P = .09) at 1 year and to the 56th percentile (P = .02) at 3 years post resection. Average body mass index increased from the 30th to the 48th and 49th percentile at 1 and 3 years (P < .05 for both), respectively. Height increased from the 39th percentile at the time of resection to the 51st percentile at 3 years (P = nonsignificant). CONCLUSION: Surgical resection of an isolated ileal segment in adolescents with CD allows for catch-up growth and reduction in medication requirements.},

The primary aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of EEN to corticosteroid (CS) therapy in newly diagnosed, treatment-naive patients with CD. A secondary aim was to describe the outcomes of EEN in a national cohort of paediatric CD patients over a 10-year period. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted at the Irish national referral centre for paediatric CD. A case-matched analysis was conducted on two cohorts matched for age, gender, disease location, disease behaviour and disease activity, who received CS or EEN as their initial treatment. Subsequently, cohort analysis was conducted on all patients who undertook a course of EEN therapy between 2004 and 2013. RESULTS: The case-matched analysis found higher remission rates after treatment with EEN (24/28, 86%) compared with those with CS (15/28, 54%; P=0.02). Dietetic contacts were found to be pivotal to the success of treatment and the attainment of remission. In total, 59 patients completed EEN at some time-point in their disease course and were included in the cohort analysis. Sixty-nine per cent of this cohort entered clinical remission (41/59). EEN was found to be most effective when used as an initial treatment (P=0.004) and less effective in patients aged under 10 years (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: EEN should be strongly considered as a favourable primary treatment over CS, especially in those diagnosed over the age of 10 years.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis, are chronic relapsing and remitting diseases of the bowel, with an unknown etiology and appear to involve interaction between genetic susceptibility, environmental factors and the immune system. Although our knowledge and understanding of the pathogenesis and causes of IBD have improved significantly, the incidence in the pediatric population is still rising. In the last decade more drugs and treatment option have become available including 5-aminosalicylate, antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunomodulators and biological agents. Before the use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha became available to patients with IBD, the risk for surgery within five years of diagnosis was very high, however, with anti-TNF-alpha treatment the risk of surgery has decreased significantly. In the pediatric population a remission in disease can be achieved by exclusive enteral nutrition. Exclusive enteral nutrition also has an important role in the improvement of nutritional status and maintained growth. In this review we summarize the current therapeutic treatments in CD. The progress in the treatment options and the development of new drugs has led to optimized tactics for achieving the primary clinical goals of therapy - induction and maintenance of remission while improving the patient's growth and overall well-being.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Data on the efficacy and safety of seasonal influenza vaccines in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain scarce. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of immunosuppressive (IS) therapeutics on serological response to 2-year influenza vaccination in IBD adults. METHODS: A multicentre prospective study performed in 255 IBD adults (18-64 years) receiving the trivalent influenza vaccine in the years 2009-2010 and 2010-2011. Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres were assessed before and 3 weeks and 6 months after vaccination. RESULTS: At inclusion, 31 patients were receiving no IS treatment (Group A), 77 were receiving IS treatment without anti-TNF (Group B) and 117 were receiving anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) treatment with or without IS treatment (Group C). Three weeks after the first vaccination, rates of seroprotection were 77, 75 and 66% for strain A/H1N12007 (p = 0.35), 77, 68 and 52% for strain A/H3N2 (p = 0.014) and 97, 96 and 95% for strain B (p = 0.99) in Groups A, B and C, respectively. Seroconversion rates for A/H1N12007 (67, 64 and 54%; p = 0.28), A/H3N2 (63, 50 and 41%; p = 0.074) and strain B (63, 76 and 60%; p = 0.078) were not significantly different among treatment groups. At 6 months after vaccination, seroprotection rates were lower in Group C compared with Groups A and B. Comparable results were observed for the second year of vaccination. No impact on Harvey-Bradshaw and Mayo scores was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccine yielded high seroprotection rates in IBD patients. Persistence of seroprotection was lower in patients with anti-TNF treatment. ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01022749.},

   abstract = {Intestinal fibrosis is a major complication of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and although inflammation is necessary for its development, it would appear that it plays a minor role in its progression as anti-inflammatory treatments in IBD do not prevent fibrosis once it has started. The processes that regulate fibrosis would thus appear to be distinct from those regulating inflammation and, therefore, a detailed understanding of these pathways is vital to the development of anti-fibrogenic strategies. There have been several recent reviews exploring what is known, and what remains unknown, about the development of intestinal fibrosis. This review is designed to add to this literature but with a focus on the cellular components that are involved in the development of fibrogenesis and the major molecular mediators that impact on these cells. The aim is to heighten the understanding of the factors involved in intestinal fibrogenesis so that detailed research can be encouraged in order to advance the processes that could lead to effective treatments.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are an important cause of morbidity and impact significantly on quality of life. Overall, current treatments do not sustain a long-term clinical remission and are associated with adverse effects, which highlight the need for new treatment options. Fucoidans are complex sulphated, fucose-rich polysaccharides, found in edible brown algae and are described as having multiple bioactivities including potent anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of two different fucoidan preparations, fucoidan-polyphenol complex (Maritech Synergy) and depyrogenated fucoidan (DPF) was evaluated in the dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) mouse model of acute colitis. Mice were treated once daily over 7 days with fucoidans via oral (Synergy or DPF) or intraperitoneal administration (DPF). Signs and severity of colitis were monitored daily before colons and spleens were collected for macroscopic evaluation, cytokine measurements and histology. Orally administered Synergy and DPF, but not intraperitoneal DPF treatment, significantly ameliorated symptoms of colitis based on retention of body weight, as well as reduced diarrhoea and faecal blood loss, compared to the untreated colitis group. Colon and spleen weight in mice treated with oral fucoidan was also significantly lower, indicating reduced inflammation and oedema. Histological examination of untreated colitis mice confirmed a massive loss of crypt architecture and goblet cells, infiltration of immune cells and oedema, while all aspects of this pathology were alleviated by oral fucoidan. Importantly, in this model, the macroscopic changes induced by oral fucoidan correlated significantly with substantially decreased production of at least 15 pro-inflammatory cytokines by the colon tissue. Overall, oral fucoidan preparations significantly reduce the inflammatory pathology associated with DSS-induced colitis and could therefore represent a novel nutraceutical option for the management of IBD.},

   abstract = {Some of the most common symptoms of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, which include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. It is therefore not surprising that clinicians and patients have wondered whether dietary patterns influence the onset or course of IBD. The question of what to eat is among the most commonly asked by patients, and among the most difficult to answer for clinicians. There are substantial variations in dietary behaviors of patients and recommendations for them, although clinicians do not routinely endorse specific diets for patients with IBD. Dietary clinical trials have been limited by their inability to include a placebo control, contamination of study groups, and inclusion of patients receiving medical therapies. Additional challenges include accuracy of information on dietary intake, complex interactions between foods consumed, and differences in food metabolism among individuals. We review the roles of diet in the etiology and management of IBD based on plausible mechanisms and clinical evidence. Researchers have learned much about the effects of diet on the mucosal immune system, epithelial function, and the intestinal microbiome; these findings could have significant practical implications. Controlled studies of patients receiving enteral nutrition and observations made from patients on exclusion diets have shown that components of whole foods can have deleterious effects for patients with IBD. Additionally, studies in animal models suggested that certain nutrients can reduce intestinal inflammation. In the future, engineered diets that restrict deleterious components but supplement beneficial nutrients could be used to modify the luminal intestinal environment of patients with IBD; these might be used alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents, or as salvage therapy for patients who do not respond or lose responsiveness to medical therapies. Stricter diets might be required to induce remission, and more sustainable exclusion diets could be used to maintain long-term remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Therapeutic targets in pediatric Crohn's disease include symptoms, quality of life (QOL), and mucosal healing. Although partial enteral nutrition (PEN), exclusive enteral nutritional (EEN), and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) therapy all improve symptoms, the comparative effectiveness of these approaches to improve QOL and achieve mucosal healing has not been assessed prospectively. METHODS: In a prospective study of children initiating PEN, EEN, or anti-TNF therapy for Crohn's disease, we compared clinical outcomes using the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), QOL (IMPACT score), and mucosal healing as estimated by fecal calprotectin (FCP). PCDAI, IMPACT, FCP, and diet (prompted 24-h recall) were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy. RESULTS: We enrolled 90 children with active Crohn's disease (PCDAI, 33.7 +/- 13.7; and FCP, 976 +/- 754), of whom 52 were treated with anti-TNF, 22 with EEN, and 16 with PEN plus ad lib diet. Clinical response (PCDAI reduction >/=15 or final PCDAI </=10) was achieved by 64% on PEN, 88% EEN, and 84% anti-TNF (test for trend P = 0.08). FCP </=250 mug/g was achieved with PEN in 14%, EEN 45%, and anti-TNF 62% (test for trend P = 0.001). Improvement in overall QOL was not statistically significantly different between the 3 groups (P = 0.86). However, QOL improvement was the greatest with EEN in the body image (P = 0.03) domain and with anti-TNF in the emotional domain (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Although PEN improved clinical symptoms, EEN and anti-TNF were more effective for decreasing mucosal inflammation and improving specific aspects of QOL.},

   abstract = {The incidence of primary Crohn colitis is uncommon and surgical treatment has remained controversial, although most patients with Crohn colitis eventually require surgical intervention. This study aims to compare the operative outcomes of patients who underwent segmental versus either total colectomy or total proctocolectomy for Crohn colitis and to assess potential risk factors associated with clinical and surgical recurrence-free survivals.This is a retrospective study of 116 patients who underwent primary surgery for Crohn colitis between August 1997 and July 2011. Patients were classified based on the type of surgery: segmental colectomy (SC group; n = 71) or either total colectomy or total proctocolectomy (TC group; n = 45).There were no significant differences in postoperative complications or the nutritional state between the SC and TC groups. Patients in TC group had a significantly higher clinical recurrence-free survival (CRFS). Among the 54 patients with multisegmental Crohn colitis, the TC group had a significantly increased CRFS and surgical recurrence-free survival (SRFS), compared with patients in the SC group (5-year CRFS: 82.0% +/- 5.8% vs 22.2% +/- 13.9%, P = 0.001; 5-year SRFS: 88.1% +/- 5.0% vs 44.4% +/- 16.6%, P = 0.001). By multivariate analysis of patients with multisegments involved, SC was a risk factor for SRFS and CRFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.637, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.387-15.509, P = 0.013 and HR = 32.407, 95% CI = 2.873-365.583, P = 0.005).TC patients have significantly increased CRFS and TC in patients with multisegment involvement may affect improved SRFS and CRFS. Among patients with multisegmental Crohn colitis, SC is an independent risk factor for CRFS and SRFS.},

   abstract = {AIM OF THE STUDY: Compared with patients with other benign intestinal conditions, patients with CD are at increased risk of developing postoperative complications following intestinal resection. We searched for useful tools for predicting postoperative complication in patients with CD by comparing the relationship between postoperative morbidity in these patients as measured by three different scoring tools: general surgical risk (POSSUM score), disease activity (CDAI), and nutritional screening (nutritional prognostic index). METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 50 patients with small bowel CD who underwent surgical resection and primary anastomosis between 1999 and 2014. RESULTS: This study enrolled 34 men and 16 women. The mean age was 38.4 years (range: 20-81 years). There was no postoperative mortality. The overall postoperative morbidity rate (33.7%) predicted by POSSUM was similar to the rate in the study patients (36.0%). Although POSSUM score predicted higher postoperative morbidity rates in patients who underwent emergency surgery (estimated morbidity: 52.8%), the actual postoperative morbidity rate in the emergency surgery group (26.7%) was smaller than in the elective surgery group (40.0%). In addition, neither preoperative nutritional status nor POSSUM score was related to the severity of postoperative complications. CDAI score was significantly related to the severity of postoperative complications (P=0.032). CONCLUSION: Based on the above results, a high preoperative CDAI score can predict negative postoperative outcomes. We believe that disease activity should be controlled using various treatment modalities, such as enteral or total parenteral nutrition as well as medication, before performing surgery in patients with CD.},

It often develops in children and adolescents, who are vulnerable to repeated exposure to ionizing radiations. Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is an increasingly important radiation-free imaging modality that is used to evaluate pediatric patients with Crohn's disease. MRE can evaluate extraluminal and extraintestinal abnormalities as well as the status of the bowel wall. In addition, MRE has an advantage in the evaluation of the small bowel involvement. MRE can be used for the initial diagnosis of Crohn's disease, and can aid in the assessment of disease activity and complications such as penetrating and fibrostenotic diseases. The aims of this article are to review the MRE technique for obtaining diagnostic and high-quality images and to discuss interpretations of imaging findings in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Iron deficiency is a common complication in patients with IBD and oral iron therapy is suggested to exacerbate IBD symptoms. We performed an open-labelled clinical trial to compare the effects of per oral (PO) versus intravenous (IV) iron replacement therapy (IRT). DESIGN: The study population included patients with Crohn's disease (CD; N=31), UC (N=22) and control subjects with iron deficiency (non-inflamed, NI=19). After randomisation, participants received iron sulfate (PO) or iron sucrose (IV) over 3 months. Clinical parameters, faecal bacterial communities and metabolomes were assessed before and after intervention. RESULTS: Both PO and IV treatments ameliorated iron deficiency, but higher ferritin levels were observed with IV. Changes in disease activity were independent of iron treatment types. Faecal samples in IBD were characterised by marked interindividual differences, lower phylotype richness and proportions of Clostridiales. Metabolite analysis also showed separation of both UC and CD from control anaemic participants. Major shifts in bacterial diversity occurred in approximately half of all participants after IRT, but patients with CD were most susceptible. Despite individual-specific changes in phylotypes due to IRT, PO treatment was associated with decreased abundances of operational taxonomic units assigned to the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus bromii, Dorea sp. and Collinsella aerofaciens. Clear IV-specific and PO-specific fingerprints were evident at the level of metabolomes, with changes affecting cholesterol-derived host substrates. CONCLUSIONS: Shifts in gut bacterial diversity and composition associated with iron treatment are pronounced in IBD participants. Despite similar clinical outcome, oral administration differentially affects bacterial phylotypes and faecal metabolites compared with IV therapy.

   abstract = {AIM: Infantile-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IO-IBD) with the onset of disease before 12 mo of age, is a different disease entity from childhood IBD. We aimed to describe the clinical features, outcome and role of mutation in interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-10 receptors (IL-10R) in Asian children with IO-IBD. METHODS: All cases of IO-IBD, defined as onset of disease before 12 mo of age, seen at University Malaya Medical Center, Malaysia were reviewed. We performed mutational analysis for IL10 and IL10R genes in patients with presenting clinical features of Crohn's disease (CD). RESULTS: Six [13%; CD = 3, ulcerative colitis (UC) = 2, IBD-unclassified (IBD-U) = 1] of the 48 children (CD = 25; UC = 23) with IBD have IO-IBD. At final review [median (range) duration of follow-up: 6.5 (3.0-20) years], three patients were in remission without immunosuppression [one each for post-colostomy (IBD-U), after standard immunosuppression (CD), and after total colectomy (UC)]. Three patients were on immunosuppression: one (UC) was in remission while two (both CD) had persistent disease. As compared with later-onset disease, IO-IBD were more likely to present with bloody diarrhea (100% vs 55%, P = 0.039) but were similar in terms of an associated autoimmune liver disease (0% vs 19%, P = 0.31), requiring biologics therapy (50% vs 36%, P = 0.40), surgery (50% vs 29%, P = 0.27), or achieving remission (50% vs 64%, P = 0.40). No mutations in either IL10 or IL10R in the three patients with CD and the only patient with IBD-U were identified. CONCLUSION: The clinical features of IO-IBD in this Asian cohort of children who were negative for IL-10 or IL-10R mutations were variable. As compared to childhood IBD with onset of disease after 12 mo of age, IO-IBD achieved remission at a similar rate.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features and extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) of Crohn disease (CD) in Korean pediatric patients. METHODS: The medical records of 73 children diagnosed with CD were retrospectively reviewed. Data regarding baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, including CD phenotype at diagnosis based on the Montreal classification, and clinical features and course of EIMs were investigated. RESULTS: Fifty-two (71.2%) of the patients were males. The mean age of the patients was 12.5 years. The mean follow-up period was 3.4 years. The disease location was ileal in 3 (4.1%) of the patients, colonic in 13 (17.8%), ileocolonic in 56 (76.7%). The clinical behavior was inflammatory in 62 (84.9%) of the patients, stricturing in 8 (11.0%), and penetrating in 3 (4.1%). Perianal abscesses or fistulas were found in 37 (50.7%) of the patients. EIMs observed during the study period were anal skin tag in 25 patients (34.2%), hypertransaminasemia in 20 (27.4%), peripheral arthritis in 2 (2.7%), erythema nodosum in 2 (2.7%), vulvitis in 1 (1.4%), uveitis in 1 (1.4%), and pulmonary thromboembolism in 1 (1.4%). CONCLUSION: Perianal diseases and manifestations were present in more than half of Korean pediatric CD patients at diagnosis. Inspection of the anus should be mandatory in Korean children with suspicious CD, as perianal fistulas, abscesses, and anal skin tags may be the first clue to the diagnosis of CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the efficacy of remission maintenance between infliximab "top-down" and "step-up" strategies in moderate to severe pediatric Crohn disease during 3 years. We also aimed to determine prognostic factors that may influence the relapse-free rate in these patients. METHODS: The present study was a retrospective review of a prospective cohort, based on an infliximab treatment protocol for pediatric Crohn disease used at Samsung Medical Center. A total of 31 patients (group A) were treated with early infliximab induction ("top-down" strategy) and 20 patients (group B) refractory to conventional therapy underwent infliximab treatment ("step-up" strategy). The efficacy of infliximab treatment was assessed by relapse-free rate and remission period rate for 3 years. A total of 11 prognostic factors that may influence the relapse-free rate were further analyzed. RESULTS: The relapse-free rates at 3 years were 35.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.194-0.519) in group A and 15.0% (95% CI 0.037-0.335) in group B (P = 0.0094). Overall remission period rate for 3 years also showed a significant difference between the 2 groups (92.1% +/- 7.2% vs 78.3% +/- 16.6%; P = 0.005). Multivariable analysis revealed that the duration from the initial diagnosis to infliximab infusion was the only factor associated with relapse-free remission for 3 years (hazard ratio = 1.077; 95% CI 1.025-1.131). CONCLUSIONS: "Top-down" strategy had a longer remission period compared with the "step-up" strategy in pediatric Crohn disease during a study period of 3 years, based on relapse-free rate and remission period rate. Earlier introduction of infliximab is recommended in pediatric patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease.},

   abstract = {Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two main types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have become increasingly common in Australasian children and adolescents in recent years. Furthermore, CD and UC are seen more often in younger children. These conditions are typically more extensive in children and tend to follow more severe disease courses than in adults. Although many children may present with typical symptoms (such as abdominal pain or bloody diarrhoea), others have atypical features (including oral ulceration, short stature or skin manifestations). In addition, many children with IBD will have altered growth or nutrition, which may compromise normal linear growth and pubertal development. Early identification and full assessment of children presenting with possible IBD are essential to avoid consequences of diagnostic delay and to optimise short- and long-term outcomes. Management of IBD encompasses various options and should be undertaken within a team-based, child and family-focused, multidisciplinary setting.},

   abstract = {Scurvy is one of the oldest diseases in human history. Nowadays, although scurvy tends to become a forgotten disease in developed country, rare cases still occur, especially in people undergoing extreme diet, old people or children with poor diet and patients with malabsorption. We describe three cases of scurvy. The first case is a patient diagnosed with Crohn's disease, the second one is in a context of anorexia nervosa and drug addiction, and the third case is in a context of social isolation. Early recognition of scurvy can be difficult because symptoms may appear nonspecific and can mimic more common conditions. In any patient with spontaneous hematoma and purpura, in the context of nutritional disorder, scurvy should be systematically considered. As this disease can lead to severe complications, such as bone pain, heart failure or gastrointestinal symptoms, nothing should delay vitamin C supplementation, which is a simple and rapidly effective treatment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Thiopurines are effective for maintenance of remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in only about half of patients. Predictors of response may assist in selecting the most appropriate patients for thiopurine therapy. Thiopurines inhibit Rac1, a GTPase that exerts an antiapoptotic effect on T-lymphocytes. A genetic association was recently demonstrated between a Rac1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and poorer response to thiopurines in adult patients with Crohn disease. We aimed to determine whether Rac1 SNPs are associated with response to thiopurines in children with IBD. METHODS: Children with IBD treated with thiopurines were prospectively followed for 1 year and were genotyped for 3 Rac1 SNPs previously found to be relevant to IBD: rs10951982, rs4720672, and rs34932801. The rate of sustained steroid-free remission (SSFR) without treatment escalation by 12 months was compared between wild types (WTs) and heterozygotes. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were studied (63% boys, 80% having Crohn disease, mean age 13 +/- 4.1). Nineteen of the 41 WT (46%) and 9 of the 15 (60%) heterozygotes for rs10951982 were in SSFR (P = 0.55). Similarly, 21 of the 45 (47%) WT and 8 of the 12 (67%) heterozygotes for rs4720672 were in remission (P = 0.33). Finally, 21 of the 45 (47%) WT and 3 of the 5 (60%) heterozygotes for rs34932801 were in remission (P = 0.66). All of the 3 comparisons remained nonsignificant in a sensitivity analysis of only the patients with Crohn disease. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find an association between 3 Rac1 SNPs and thiopurine effectiveness by 12 months in a prospective study of children with IBD. Other predictors of response should be sought to optimize patient selection for thiopurine therapy.},

   abstract = {Abnormal composition of intestinal bacteria--"dysbiosis"-is characteristic of Crohn's disease. Disease treatments include dietary changes and immunosuppressive anti-TNFalpha antibodies as well as ancillary antibiotic therapy, but their effects on microbiota composition are undetermined. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we analyzed fecal samples from a prospective cohort of pediatric Crohn's disease patients starting therapy with enteral nutrition or anti-TNFalpha antibodies and reveal the full complement and dynamics of bacteria, fungi, archaea, and viruses during treatment. Bacterial community membership was associated independently with intestinal inflammation, antibiotic use, and therapy. Antibiotic exposure was associated with increased dysbiosis, whereas dysbiosis decreased with reduced intestinal inflammation. Fungal proportions increased with disease and antibiotic use. Dietary therapy had independent and rapid effects on microbiota composition distinct from other stressor-induced changes and effectively reduced inflammation. These findings reveal that dysbiosis results from independent effects of inflammation, diet, and antibiotics and shed light on Crohn disease treatments.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The respective role of disease activity and steroid therapy in growth impairment in paediatric-onset Crohn disease (CD) is still debated. Our aim was to investigate whether the growth pattern of children with CD was correlated with the inflammatory status during the disease course, regardless the cumulative duration of steroid therapy. METHODS: One hundred and seven patients with a diagnosis of CD <17 years, followed during >/=2 years and for whom >/=2 height measures were available during follow-up, were identified between 1998 and 2010. Height, C-reactive protein (CRP), orosomucoid, and steroid therapy duration were collected at each visit. The relationship between the evolution of growth velocity and inflammatory status during follow-up was investigated using a linear mixed model with random coefficients. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 11.7 years (Q1-Q3: 9.8-13.5). Mean height for age (H/A) z score was 0.14 +/- 1.29 at diagnosis and 0.05 +/- 1.23 among the 75 patients who had reached their final height at maximal follow-up (median: 4.9 years; Q1-Q3: 3.8-6.4). Growth failure (H/A z score <-2) was present in 7 (8%) patients at diagnosis and 5 (5%) at maximal follow-up. Growth velocity was negatively correlated with the evolution of CRP (P < 0.0001) and orosomucoid (P < 0.0001) during follow-up. After adjustment for the cumulative duration of steroid therapy, these 2 correlations remained significant (CRP: P = 0.0008; orosomucoid: P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Children with CD with uncontrolled inflammatory status have a lower growth velocity. The inflammatory status should be kept as close to normal as possible in paediatric-onset patients with CD to optimize their growth pattern.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Genome-wide association studies have identified 200 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) loci, but the genetic architecture of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis remain incompletely defined. Here, we aimed to identify novel associations between IBD and functional genetic variants using the Illumina ExomeChip (San Diego, CA). METHODS: Genotyping was performed in 10,523 IBD cases and 5726 non-IBD controls. There were 91,713 functional single-nucleotide polymorphism loci in coding regions analyzed. A novel identified association was replicated further in 2 independent cohorts. We further examined the association of the identified single-nucleotide polymorphism with microbiota from 338 mucosal lavage samples in the Mucosal Luminal Interface cohort measured using 16S sequencing. RESULTS: We identified an association between CD and a missense variant encoding alanine or threonine at position 391 in the zinc transporter solute carrier family 39, member 8 protein (SLC39A8 alanine 391 threonine, rs13107325) and replicated the association with CD in 2 replication cohorts (combined meta-analysis P = 5.55 x 10(-13)). This variant has been associated previously with distinct phenotypes including obesity, lipid levels, blood pressure, and schizophrenia. We subsequently determined that the CD risk allele was associated with altered colonic mucosal microbiome composition in both healthy controls (P = .009) and CD cases (P = .0009). Moreover, microbes depleted in healthy carriers strongly overlap with those reduced in CD patients (P = 9.24 x 10(-16)) and overweight individuals (P = 6.73 x 10(-16)). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an SLC39A8-dependent shift in the gut microbiome could explain its pleiotropic effects on multiple complex diseases including CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Quality of marriage exerts a great effect on quality of life [QOL] and health outcomes. Few data are available on the effects of Crohn's disease [CD] on quality of marriage. We aimed to clarify whether and how CD affected the marital relationship. METHODS: Web-based questionnaires were created including an ENRICH marital inventory, a general QOL survey [SF12], a short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire [SIBDQ] and a modified Harvey-Bradshaw Index [HBI]. Married patients were enrolled through the outpatient registration system and diverse social media websites. Controls were subsequently enrolled and matched with the ratio of 1:1 through invitation emails and internet advertising. RESULTS: A total of 243 patients completed valid questionnaires and then 243 matched individuals were enrolled. Male patients were more affected, representing a significantly reduced total marital score. CD impaired the dimensions of idealistic distortion and marital satisfaction in both genders. There were correlations between quality of marriage, SF12, SIBDQ and HBI. Mental scale of SF12 correlated best with the marital relationship, indicating more significant involvement of mental adjustment. Multiple linear regression demonstrated that spouse's educational background, duration of marriage from disease onset, enteral nutrition, hospitalisation in past 12 months, and number of previous hospitalisations, independently impacted on quality of marriage. CONCLUSIONS: Certain aspects of the marital relationship were impaired in CD patients, especially in male subjects. In addition to medication, mental interventions should be given attention to improve the marriage of CD patients. Despite some novel findings in this study, this research orientation deserves more attention.},

   abstract = {Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are emerging as important components of our immune system that have critical effector and regulatory functions in both innate and adaptive immune responses. They are enriched at mucosal surfaces, such as lung and intestine. Our previous work has shown that Lineage-CRTH2-CD45+NKp44-CD117-CD127+ILC1s accumulated in the inflamed terminal ileum of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) at the expense of NKp44+ILC3s. This phenotype conversion impairs the intestinal barrier integrity and contributes to the dysregulated immune responses of CD patients. Our next step was to search for pathways to modulate this phenotype switch. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor. Initial studies of AHR concentrated on its role in the detoxification of xenobiotics. However, recent research has focused on the immune system. Especially, AHR pathway is proven to be essential for the maintenance of intestinal ILC3s in mouse models. We examined whether AHR pathway participated in the human intestinal ILC phenotype change in the inflamed terminal ileum of CD patients. As anticipated, NKp44+ILC3s, NKp44-ILC3s and ILC1s had differential AHR expression. This AHR signaling mediated CD117 expression on the surface of ILC3s. The conversion from ILC3 to ILC1 was accompanied by the downregulation of AHR expression. We further observed that there was a disparity between AHR protein expression and mRNA expression in the inflamed terminal ileum tissues of CD patients compared to unaffected areas. These findings suggest that AHR pathway is also important for human intestinal ILC phenotype regulation and impaired AHR signaling in the inflamed gut of CD patients possibly contributes to the ILC3/ILC1 conversion.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Severe forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that develop in very young children can be caused by variants in a single gene. We performed whole-exome sequence (WES) analysis to identify genetic factors that might cause granulomatous colitis and severe perianal disease, with recurrent bacterial and viral infections, in an infant of consanguineous parents. METHODS: We performed targeted WES analysis of DNA collected from the patient and her parents. We validated our findings by a similar analysis of DNA from 150 patients with very-early-onset IBD not associated with known genetic factors analyzed in Toronto, Oxford, and Munich. We compared gene expression signatures in inflamed vs noninflamed intestinal and rectal tissues collected from patients with treatment-resistant Crohn's disease who participated in a trial of ustekinumab. We performed functional studies of identified variants in primary cells from patients and cell culture. RESULTS: We identified a homozygous variant in the tripartite motif containing 22 gene (TRIM22) of the patient, as well as in 2 patients with a disease similar phenotype. Functional studies showed that the variant disrupted the ability of TRIM22 to regulate nucleotide binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2)-dependent activation of interferon-beta signaling and nuclear factor-kappaB. Computational studies demonstrated a correlation between the TRIM22-NOD2 network and signaling pathways and genetic factors associated very early onset and adult-onset IBD. TRIM22 is also associated with antiviral and mycobacterial effectors and markers of inflammation, such as fecal calprotectin, C-reactive protein, and Crohn's disease activity index scores. CONCLUSIONS: In WES and targeted exome sequence analyses of an infant with severe IBD characterized by granulomatous colitis and severe perianal disease, we identified a homozygous variant of TRIM22 that affects the ability of its product to regulate NOD2. Combined computational and functional studies showed that the TRIM22-NOD2 network regulates antiviral and antibacterial signaling pathways that contribute to inflammation. Further study of this network could lead to new disease markers and therapeutic targets for patients with very early and adult-onset IBD.},

   abstract = {We conducted a study to evaluate the impact of the exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) on perioperative outcome in Crohn's disease (CD) patients following immunosuppressive therapy. Patients with CD followed at a referral center between January 2001 and March 2014 who underwent abdominal surgery were identified. Patients were divided into 4 groups: patients not exposed to immunosuppressive agents in the previous 8 weeks before surgery (group 1); patients received immunosuppressive medications without preoperative drug-free interval (group 2); patients had preoperative immunosuppressants-free interval (group 3); patients treated with adding EEN to preoperative immunosuppressants-free interval regimen (group 4). Urgent operation requirement, stoma creation, postoperative complications, readmission, and reoperation were compared in patients among groups. Overall, 708 abdominal surgeries performed in 498 CD patients were identified. Three hundred seventy-six (53.11%) surgeries performed in those receiving preoperative immunosuppressive medications. Compared with other groups, group 2 had increased postoperative complications, more frequent urgent operation, and higher rate of stoma creation. Patients in group 4 were found to have better outcome including lower rate of stoma creation (P < 0.05), and decreased incidence of postoperative complications (P < 0.05) compared with group 2 and group 3. Additionally, decreased urgent operation requirement (P < 0.05) and extended preoperative drug-free interval (P < 0.001) were observed in the group 4 than those in the group 3. Preoperative optimization of CD following immunosuppressive therapy by EEN prolongs the immunosuppressants-free interval, reduces the risk of urgent surgery and reoperation, and most importantly, decreases complications after abdominal surgery.},

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of clinical records at a tertiary care children's hospital, including serial electrophysiological studies. RESULTS: Sixteen patients aged 6-24 years received thalidomide to treat Crohn's disease from 2002 to 2012. Nine subjects had electrophysiological evidence of sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy, 8 of whom had sensory and/or motor symptoms. The patients with polyneuropathy received thalidomide for 5 weeks to 52 months, with cumulative doses ranging from 1.4 to 207.7 g. All subjects with cumulative doses greater than 60 g developed polyneuropathy, and 4 of the 5 subjects who received thalidomide for more than 20 months developed polyneuropathy. The 7 subjects who had normal neurophysiological studies received therapy for 1 week to 25 months, with cumulative doses ranging from 0.7 to 47 g. In contrast to some previous reports, several patients had sensorimotor polyneuropathies, rather than pure sensory neuropathies. In patients with neuropathy who received therapy for more than 24 months and had 3 or more electromyography studies, the severity of the neuropathy plateaued. CONCLUSIONS: Factors in addition to the total dose may contribute to the risk profile for thalidomide neuropathy, including pharmacogenetic susceptibilities. The severity of the neuropathy does not worsen relentlessly. Children, adolescents, and young adults receiving thalidomide should undergo regular neurophysiological studies to monitor for neuropathy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gut microbiota is involved in many physiological functions and its imbalance is associated with several diseases, particularly with inflammatory bowel diseases. Mucosa-associated microbiota could have a key role in induction of host immunity and in inflammatory process. Although the role of fungi has been suggested in inflammatory disease pathogenesis, the fungal microbiota has not yet been deeply explored. Here we analysed the bacterial and fungal composition of the mucosa-associated microbiota of Crohn's disease patients and healthy subjects. METHODS: Our prospective, observational study evaluated bacterial and fungal composition of mucosa-associated microbiota of 23 Crohn's disease patients [16 in flare, 7 in remission] and 10 healthy subjects, using 16S [MiSeq] and ITS2 [pyrosequencing] sequencing, respectively. Global fungal load was assessed by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Bacterial microbiota in Crohn's disease patients was characterised by a restriction in biodiversity. with an increase of Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria. Global fungus load was significantly increased in Crohn's disease flare compared with healthy subjects [p < 0.05]. In both groups, the colonic mucosa-associated fungal microbiota was dominated by Basidiomycota and Ascomycota phyla. Cystofilobasidiaceae family and Candida glabrata species were overrepresented in Crohn's disease. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Filobasidium uniguttulatum species were associated with non-inflamed mucosa, whereas Xylariales order was associated with inflamed mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the alteration of the bacterial microbiota and is the first demonstration of the existence of an altered fungal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients, suggesting that fungi may play a role in pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic and progressive inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Despite the availability of powerful immunosuppressants, many patients with Crohn's disease still require one or more intestinal resections throughout the course of their disease. Multiple resections and a progressive reduction in bowel length can lead to the development of short bowel syndrome, a form of intestinal failure that compromises fluid, electrolyte, and nutrient absorption. The pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome involves a reduction in intestinal surface area, alteration in the enteric hormonal feedback, dysmotility, and related comorbidities. Most patients will initially require parenteral nutrition as a primary or supplemental source of nutrition, although several patients may eventually wean off nutrition support depending on the residual gut anatomy and adherence to medical and nutritional interventions. Available surgical treatments focus on reducing motility, lengthening the native small bowel, or small bowel transplantation. Care of these complex patients with short bowel syndrome requires a multidisciplinary approach of physicians, dietitians, and nurses to provide optimal intestinal rehabilitation, nutritional support, and improvement in quality of life.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare factors considered by parents to those considered by adolescents making decisions about chronic disease treatments. METHODS: We conducted individual interviews with 15 parent-adolescent dyads in which the adolescent had either juvenile idiopathic arthritis or Crohn's disease. Questions focused on treatment decisions, with an emphasis on the factors that influenced each individual's preferences related to biologic therapies. A multidisciplinary team developed a coding structure. All interviews were coded by two people with disagreements resolved through discussion. We used content analysis and coding matrices to examine decision factors within and between parent-adolescent dyads. RESULTS: Parents and adolescents both participated in decisions about treatment with biologic therapies but considered decision factors differently. In only half of cases did parents and adolescents agree on the factor that most influenced their decision. Although their decision factors often fell into similar categories (e.g. treatment risks, quality of life), in many cases the specifics varied between adolescents and their parents. Adolescents were more likely to focus on immediate treatment effects and quality of life while parents took a longer term view of the decision. Agreement within dyads was most consistent when a special circumstance influenced the treatment decision. CONCLUSIONS: Differences regarding influential decision factors exist within parent-adolescent dyads. Continued research is needed to determine the extent to which such differences are due to individual preferences or to variations in the information available to each person. Future decision support interventions will need to address parents' and adolescents' potentially disparate views and information needs.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Association of Signal transducers and activators of transcription-4 (STAT4) gene polymorphism with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease have been investigated in a number of epidemiological studies, but the results are inclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to more precisely estimate the relationship. METHODS: The databases of Pubmed and CBM updated to October, 2014 were retrieved. Random- or fixed-effect model was used to estimate odd radio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) on the basis of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Seven articles containing 2196 Crohn's disease (CD) cases, 1588 ulcerative colitis (UC) cases and 4126 controls were identified. We detected a significant association between STAT4 rs7574865 polymorphism and IBD susceptibility in overall population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.855, 95% CI=0.760-0.962, P=0.009), but not in Caucasian and Asian population, respectively. No association was detected between rs7574865 polymorphism and CD susceptibility in overall, Asian and Caucasian population, respectively. Interestingly, a significant association was detected between rs7574865 with UC susceptibility in overall population (G vs. T, OR=0.881, 95% CI=0.798-0.972, P=0.012; GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.788, 95% CI=0.679-0.914, P=0.002; GG vs. TT, OR=0.683, 95% CI=0.498-0.937, P=0.018) and Caucasians (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.833, 95% CI=0.701-0.990, P=0.038; GG+GT vs. TT, OR=0.667, 95% CI=0.456-0.975, P=0.037; GG vs. TT, OR=0.636, 95% CI=0.433-0.934, P=0.021), respectively, and a possible association was found in Asian population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.709, 95% CI=0.503-0.998, P=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: STAT4 rs7574865 gene is IBD risk factor, and this gene polymorphism is associated with UC susceptibility, especially in Caucasians. To confirm these findings, further studies with more sample size are required for a definitive conclusion.},

   abstract = {Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process, whereby unwanted cytoplasmic contents are enclosed by the double-membrane autophagosomes and delivered to the lysosomes for degradation. It is responsible for the recycling of nutrients and cellular components, thus playing a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis as well as cell survival during stress conditions. Perturbations in autophagy are implicated in multiple diseases, such as cancers and neuro-degeneration diseases. Recent studies demonstrate that autophagy may participate in almost every step of immune responses, including pathogen recognition, antigen processing and presentation, immune cell development and function, and immunoregulation. The pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease, has been reported to be associated with dysregulated autophagy. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, potentially fatal autoimmune disease, characterized by dysregulation of immune cells and production of autoantibodies that cause widespread tissue and organ damage. The pathogenesis of SLE remains unclear. With several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in autophagy-related gene5 (ATG5) being linked to SLE susceptibility, more and more lines of evidence from animal model, cell biology, immunology, and genetics studies show that autophagy contributes to the occurrence, development, and severity of SLE.},

   abstract = {Several epidemiological investigations have been conducted to evaluate the relationship between dietary fiber intake and inflammatory bowel diseases, but the results are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively summarize the evidence from observational studies. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Knowledge were searched for relevant articles published up to November 2014. The combined relative risks were calculated with the fixed- or random-effects model. Dose-response relationship was assessed using restricted cubic spline model. We hypothesized that the meta-analysis could yield a summary effect, which would indicate that dietary fiber intake could decrease the risk of ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease (CD). Overall, 8 articles involving 2 cohort studies, 1 nested case-control study, and 5 case-control studies were finally included in this study. The pooled relative risks with 95% confidence intervals of ulcerative colitis and CD for the highest vs lowest categories of dietary fiber intake were 0.80 (0.64-1.00) and 0.44 (0.29-0.69), respectively. A linear dose-response relationship was found between dietary fiber and CD risk, and the risk of CD decreased by 13% (P < .05) for every 10 g/d increment in fiber intake. The results from this meta-analysis indicated that the intake of dietary fiber was significantly associated with a decreased risk of inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Treatments for Crohn's disease (CD) have been linked to serious infections, malignancies, and dermatologic complications. We pooled and analyzed clinical trials of certolizumab pegol, a pegylated humanized Fab' fragment against tumor necrosis factor, to quantify safety events in patients with CD. METHODS: We collected data from 5 placebo-controlled trials, 9 open-label studies, and 1 dose-regimen study, conducted globally through April 2014. A total of 2570 patients with moderate to severe CD were treated with certolizumab pegol, with 4378.1 patient-years of exposure. Data were analyzed in 2 groups: patients from placebo-controlled (PC) trials treated with placebo (n = 875) or certolizumab pegol (n = 919) for 6 to 38 weeks (the PC group) or all patients exposed to certolizumab pegol (n = 2570), for durations of 6 to 362 weeks (the all-studies group). Incidence rates (IRs; incidence/100 patient-years) of adverse events (AEs) were calculated from first dose through 70 days (approximately 5 half-lives) after the last dose. RESULTS: In the PC group, IRs for serious AEs were similar among patients given certolizumab pegol (31.35/100 patient-years) vs placebo (24.33/100 patient-years). IRs of serious infections or malignancies were low among patients receiving short-term treatment with certolizumab pegol (8.49/100 patient-years and 1.01/100 patient-years, respectively, in the PC group) and did not increase with long-term treatment (6.47/100 patient-years and 0.80/100 patient-years, respectively, in the all-studies group). IRs of psoriasis or psoriasiform dermatitis were low in the PC group (1.01/100 patient-years and 0/100 patient-years, respectively); in the placebo group, these IRs were 0.38 per 100 patient-years and 0 per 100 patient-years, respectively. IRs of psoriasis or psoriasiform dermatitis did not increase with long-term treatment (0.93/100 patient-years and 0.09/100 patient-years, respectively, in the all-studies group). CONCLUSIONS: Based on an analysis of data pooled from 15 trials of patients with CD, the safety profile for long-term therapy with certolizumab pegol therapy is similar to that reported from short-term studies. Overall rates of AEs, serious infections, malignancies, and psoriasis did not increase with long-term treatment, suggesting a favorable risk-benefit ratio with long-term certolizumab pegol therapy in CD.

   abstract = {Faecalibacterium prausnitzii depletion in intestinal diseases has been extensively reported, but little is known about intraspecies variability. This work aims to determine if subjects with gastrointestinal disease host mucosa-associated F. prausnitzii populations different from those hosted by healthy individuals. A new species-specific PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) method targeting the 16S rRNA gene was developed to fingerprint F. prausnitzii populations in biopsy specimens from 31 healthy control (H) subjects and 36 Crohn's disease (CD), 23 ulcerative colitis (UC), 6 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and 22 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The richness of F. prausnitzii subtypes was lower in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients than in H subjects. The most prevalent operational taxonomic units (OTUs) consisted of four phylotypes (OTUs with a 99% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity [OTU99]), which were shared by all groups of patients. Their distribution and the presence of some disease-specific F. prausnitzii phylotypes allowed us to differentiate the populations in IBD and CRC patients from that in H subjects. At the level of a minimum similarity of 97% (OTU97), two phylogroups accounted for 98% of the sequences. Phylogroup I was found in 87% of H subjects but in under 50% of IBD patients (P = 0.003). In contrast, phylogroup II was detected in >75% of IBD patients and in only 52% of H subjects (P = 0.005). This study reveals that even though the main members of the F. prausnitzii population are present in both H subjects and individuals with gut diseases, richness is reduced in the latter and an altered phylotype distribution exists between diseases. This approach may serve as a basis for addressing the suitability of F. prausnitzii phylotypes to be quantified as a putative biomarker of disease and depicting the importance of the loss of these subtypes in disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii comprises 2 phylogroups, whose abundance in healthy and diseased gut and in conjunction with Escherichia coli has not yet been studied. This work aims to determine the contribution of F. prausnitzii phylogroups I and II in intestinal disease and to assess their potential diagnostic usefulness as biomarkers for gut diseases. METHODS: Total F. prausnitzii, its phylogroups, and E. coli loads were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction targeting the 16S rRNA gene on biopsies from 31 healthy controls (H), 45 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 25 patients with ulcerative colitis, 10 patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and 20 patients with colorectal cancer. Data were normalized to total bacterial counts and analyzed according to patients' disease location and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Lower levels of both total F. prausnitzii and phylogroup I were found in subjects with CD, ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer (P < 0.001) compared with H subjects. Phylogroup I load was a better biomarker than total F. prausnitzii to discriminate subjects with gut disorders from H. Phylogroup II depletion was observed only in patients with CD (P < 0.001) and can be potentially applied to differentiate ulcerative pancolitis from colonic CD. No statistically significant correlation between E. coli and any of the 2 F. prausnitzii phylogroups was found in any group of patients or by inflammatory bowel disease location. Phylogroup I was lower in active patients with CD, whereas those CD with intestinal resection showed a reduction in phylogroup II. Treatments with mesalazine and immunosuppressants did not result in the recovery of F. prausnitzii phylogroups abundance. CONCLUSIONS: F. prausnitzii phylogroup I was depleted in CD, ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer, whereas phylogroup II was specifically reduced in CD. Quantification of F. prausnitzii phylogroups and E. coli may help to identify gut disorders and to classify inflammatory bowel disease location.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Body mass index [BMI] is widely used to measure nutritional status in Crohn's disease [CD] patients, but limitations remain. Measuring handgrip strength index, in addition to BMI, may aid in overcoming limitations. METHODS: A total of 150 patients with CD and 254 controls were included in this study. All patients and controls underwent BMI, handgrip strength and bioelectrical impedance analysis. Bioelectrical impedance analysis included body cell mass, bone mineral content, skeletal muscle mass and body fat mass. A total of 88 CD patients were age-, sex- and BMI-matched with healthy controls for further analysis. RESULTS: BMI, body cell mass, body cell mass index, handgrip strength and handgrip strength index were all significantly decreased in the group of CD patients compared with controls [p < 0.0001]. When paired by BMI, healthy controls had significantly increased body cell mass index[p = 0.0344] and handgrip strength index [p = 0.0010] compared to patients. In addition, handgrip strength was well correlated with body cell mass [r = 0.8365, p < 0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: BMI is widely used for detecting malnutrition, but it is less sensitive in predicting loss of body cell mass and skeletal muscle mass. Our study shows that handgrip strength index is an effective and convenient parameter to predict the functional nutritional status and muscular health in CD patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To observe the relationship between vitamin D status and seasons, disease activity, disease location, growth and steroid treatment in children with Crohn's disease (CD). To search for the risk factors of vitamin D deficiency in CD children. To discuss the role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis and treatments of CD. METHOD: Sixty CD children (63.3% male) and 121 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects were enrolled. Data including growth, clinical characteristics, time for vitamin D blood test, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein, serum 25(OH)D concentration and steroid treatments were collected. The relationship between vitamin D status and disease activity, disease location, growth and steroid treatments in children with CD were analized. RESULT: The serum concentration of 25(OH)D was 57.2(22.3-246.0) nmol/L, which was significantly lower than that of controls (67.3 (57.3-78.4) nmol/L) (Z=-5.009, P=0.000). Hypovitaminosis D was most prevalent during the winter and spring (November to April, 46.8(31.8-83.4) nmol/L) rather than summer and autumn (May to October, 63.3(22.3-246.0) nmol/L, Z=-1.994, P=0.046). Univariate logistic regression demonstrated that factors increasing the risk of vitamin D deficiency in Crohn's disease were: age over 10 years (OR=4.571, 95% CI: 1.452-14.389), small intestine involved diseases (OR=5.211, 95% CI: 1.278-21.237), high C reactive protein levels (>/=8 mg/L) (OR=4.500, 95% CI: 1.094-18.503) and steroid therapy (OR=4.297, 95% CI: 1.413-13.068). Among those risk factors, all but age were determined to be risks of vitamin D deficiency by further multivariate logistic regression. There was no significant correlation between vitamin D deficiency and gender, disease duration, stricture, penetration, perianal disease (fistula, ulcer or abscess), white blood cell counts, hemoglobin, platelet counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum albumin levels, pediatric Crohn's disease activity index and nutrition therapy (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Hypovitaminosis D was prevalent in children with CD. Serum concentration of vitamin D was associated with season. Steroid treatment, small intestine involved disease and high C reactive protein (more than 8 mg/L) are risk factors of vitamin D deficiency in CD children.},

   abstract = {Aims. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) and corticosteroids in inducing remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) and the effects of the treatment on growth improvements. Methods. Data was retrospectively collected for children and adolescents newly diagnosed with CD in a referral center. Patients who were followed up for more than 2 months with mild to moderate disease were included. Basic demographics, history, physical examination, the pediatric Crohn disease activity index (PCDAI), laboratory findings, endoscopic findings, and adverse effects were recorded. Remission was defined as PCDAI < 10 points. Results. Ten subjects received EEN and 18 patients received corticosteroids. The median follow-up in EEN group and steroid group was 9.2 weeks and 9.6 weeks, respectively. The remission rate in EEN group was significantly higher than that in steroid group (90.0% versus 50.0%, resp., P < 0.05). Growth improvement, which was evaluated by changes in height for age z-score, was more apparent in EEN group than that in steroids group (P < 0.05). No adverse effects were observed in EEN group. Conclusions. In children with mild to moderate CD, EEN is more effective than corticosteroids in improving disease severity and growth deficiency, as well as providing less side effects.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Monitoring the response to biological treatment in Crohn's disease (CD) is a very important element of the therapeutic optimisation. AIM: To evaluate the usefulness of measuring calprotectin, lactoferrin, and myeloperoxidase in stool as markers of long-term clinical and endoscopic response to anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) treatment in CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The studied group consisted of 35 CD patients treated with anti-TNF-alpha antibodies. Clinical activity was evaluated using Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), and the exacerbation of endoscopic changes was evaluated using a Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD). The concentration of calprotectin, lactoferrin, and myeloperoxidase was measured using the ELISA method. All measurements were performed three times - before, after 3 months, and after a year of therapy. RESULTS: During anti-TNF treatment the concentrations of all measured faecal markers decreased significantly in relation to baseline values. We observed a significant correlation at all time-points: before the therapy, after 3 months, and 12 months after starting the therapy, between the concentration of calprotectin and SES-CD, calprotectin and CDAI, as well as between lactoferrin and SES-CD, and lactoferrin and CDAI. Myeloperoxidase correlated with both SES-CD and CDAI only after 1 year of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin are valuable markers of clinical and endoscopic activity of CD in patients treated with anti-TNF antibodies. They are useful in monitoring the response to treatment. The usefulness of myeloperoxidase in this respect remains controversial.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract of unknown cause. Malnutrition associated with active CD has been reduced although obesity has increased. Dietary strategies such as those with high-protein have been proposed to reduce body fat. This study compares the effects of two supplements on the nutritional status of CD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 68 CD patients were randomized in two groups: whey protein group (WP) and soy protein group (SP). Using bioimpedance analysis, anthropometry and albumin and pre-albumin dosages the nutritional status was measured before starting the intervention and after 8 and 16 weeks. The disease activity was determined by Crohn's Disease Activity Index and serum C-reactive protein dosage and dietary intake by 24h dietary recalls. RESULTS: Forty-one patients concluded the study and both supplements changed body composition similarly. Triceps skin fold thickness (p< 0.001) and body fat percentage (p=0.001) decreased, whereas mid-arm muscle circumference (p=0.004), corrected arm muscle area (p=0.005) and body lean percentage (p=0.001) increased. CONCLUSIONS: For Crohn's disease patients undergoing anti TNF-alpha and azatioprine therapies, supplementation with whey and soy proteins changes body composition through reduction of body fat and thus contributes to control inflammation.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The incidence of incisional surgical site infections (SSIs) is reported to be higher among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) than among those with colorectal cancer. It has also been reported that the preoperative nutritional and inflammatory status is associated with the frequency of postoperative complications. Onodera's prognostic nutritional index (OPNI) is a simple and useful parameter for determining the nutritional and inflammatory status. In the present study, we retrospectively investigated the correlation between the OPNI and the incidence of incisional SSI in patients with CD who had undergone bowel resection. METHODS: A total of 177 CD patients who underwent abdominal surgery were enrolled. Various clinical factors and the OPNI values were evaluated to identify risk factors for incisional SSIs. RESULTS: The incidence of incisional SSIs was 19.8 %. A multivariate analysis indicated that the OPNI was an independent risk factor for incisional SSIs. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective study suggest that the OPNI is an independent risk factor for incisional SSIs in patients with a history of bowel resection for CD.},

   abstract = {Disruption of the homeostatic balance of intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (MQs) may contribute to inflammatory bowel disease. We characterized DC and MQ populations, including their ability to produce retinoic acid, in clinical material encompassing Crohn's ileitis, Crohn's colitis and ulcerative colitis (UC) as well as mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) draining these sites. Increased CD14(+)DR(int) MQs characterized inflamed intestinal mucosa while total CD141(+) or CD1c(+) DCs numbers were unchanged. However, CD103(+) DCs, including CD141(+)CD103(+) and CD1c(+)CD103(+) DCs, were reduced in inflamed intestine. In MLNs, two CD14(-) DC populations were identified: CD11c(int)HLADR(hi) and CD11c(hi)HLADR(int) cells. A marked increase of CD11c(hi)HLADR(int) DC, particularly DR(int)CD1c(+) DCs, characterized MLNs draining inflamed intestine. The fraction of DC and MQ populations expressing aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, reflecting retinoic acid synthesis, in UC colon, both in active disease and remission, were reduced compared to controls and inflamed Crohn's colon. In contrast, no difference in the frequency of ALDH(+) cells among blood precursors was detected between UC patients and non-inflamed controls. This suggests that ALDH activity in myeloid cells in the colon of UC patients, regardless of whether the disease is active or in remission, is influenced by the intestinal environment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The cellular mechanisms leading to infliximab therapy response in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are incompletely known. We therefore investigated early effects of infliximab therapy on monocytes and associated chemokines linked to clinical therapy response in UC patients. METHODS: Blood and biopsies were obtained from anti-TNF therapy-naive UC patients (n = 43) before (baseline) and during induction therapy with infliximab. Therapy response was evaluated at Week 14. Expression of monocyte activation markers and levels of chemokines in serum and biopsies were determined. Quantitative proteomic analysis was performed in cultured mucosal biopsies, and obtained data was validated in serum. RESULTS: In therapy responders, but not in non-responders, infliximab reduced blood monocyte expression of CD14 and CD86, 2 weeks after therapy commenced, relative to baseline. Serum CCL2 levels were decreased only among therapy responders at Week 2 and Week 14, relative to baseline. These data corresponded with lower levels of CD14, CD86 and CCL2 in intestinal tissue in responders as compared with non-responders at Week 14. Proteomic analysis of cultured biopsies showed that infliximab induced a reduction in Tenascin C that predicted downregulation of CCL2. Therapy responders, but not non-responders, had decreased serum Tenascin C levels at Week 2 and Week 14, relative to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab therapy response in UC patients is associated with reduced monocyte activation and serum levels of CCL2 2 weeks after therapy commencement. In therapy responders, infliximab influenced Tenascin C, which might be a regulator of CCL2 expression and important for induction of the clinical therapy response.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] therapy is used in patients with ulcerative colitis [UC], but not all patients respond to treatment. Antimicrobial peptides [AMPs] and the gut microbiota are essential for gut homeostasis and may be important for treatment outcome. The aim of this study was to determine AMP and microbiota profiles in patients with UC before anti-TNF therapy start and correlate these data to treatment outcome. METHODS: Serum and biopsies were obtained from UC patients naive to biological therapy [n = 56] before anti-TNF therapy start [baseline]. Fecal samples were taken at baseline and Weeks 2 and 6. Quantitative proteomic analysis was performed in mucosal biopsies. Expression of AMPs and cytokines was determined in biopsies and serum. Microbiota analysis of fecal samples was performed using GA-map Dysbiosis Test and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction [rtPCR]. Treatment response was evaluated 12-14 weeks after baseline. RESULTS: At baseline, proteomic analysis of biopsies showed that treatment responders and non-responders had differential expression of AMPs. Eleven AMP and AMP-related genes were analysed by rtPCR in mucosal biopsies and could together discriminate responders from non-responders at baseline. The most important nominators for response were increased expression of defensin 5 and eosinophilic cationic protein. Microbiota analysis revealed lower dysbiosis indexes and higher abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in responders compared with non-responders at baseline. Also, abundance of F. prausnitzii increased during induction therapy in responders. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF therapy responders and non-responders display distinctly separate patterns of mucosal AMP expression and gut microbiota before treatment start. This indicates that intestinal antimicrobial/microbial composition can influence treatment outcome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and encompass Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD are often associated with extraintestinal manifestations affecting multiple organs including the liver. Increased levels of serum aminotransferases, possibly related to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, constitute one of the most frequently described IBD-related liver diseases. The PNPLA3 I148M substitution is a major common genetic determinant of hepatic fat content and progression to chronic liver disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether carriers of PNPLA3 148M allele with IBD have higher risk of liver steatosis and increase in transaminases levels. METHODS: The PNPLA3 I148M (rs738409) genotype was performed by Taqman assays in 158 individuals from Southern Italy (namely, Catanzaro cohort) and in 207 individuals from Northern Italy (namely, Milan cohort) with a definite diagnosis of IBD. Demographic and clinical data and also alanine transaminase levels were collected for both cohorts. The Catanzaro cohort underwent liver evaluation by sonography and liver stiffness and controlled attenuation parameter measurements by transient elastography. RESULTS: Here, we show for the first time that carriers of the PNPLA3 148M allele with IBD have a greater risk of hepatic steatosis (odds ratio, 2.9, and confidence interval, 1.1-7.8), higher controlled attenuation parameter values (P = 0.029), and increased circulating alanine transaminase (P = 0.035) in the Catanzaro cohort. We further confirm the higher alanine transaminase levels in the Milan cohort (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that PNPLA3 148M carriers with IBD have higher susceptibility to hepatic steatosis and liver damage.},

   abstract = {AIM: The study aimed to evaluate high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) as a diagnostic and predictive marker in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). MATERIAL/METHODS: Medical history of 106 patients with IBD revealed hsCRP concentrations at diagnosis and during the follow-up period. RESULTS: The study showed that the majority of investigated patients had elevated hsCRP concentrations at diagnosis, although the mean concentration was much higher in the group of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) than the group with ulcerative colitis (UC) (P<0.001). The overall decrease in mean hsCRP concentration observed during the follow-up period was larger in the group of CD patients. The analysis showed a correlation between hsCRP concentrations at diagnosis and risk of surgery in the group of CD patients (r=0.408, P=0.002), but not in the group of UC patients. In a logistic regression analysis, surgery in CD patients was associated with age (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.8-1.0, P=0.05) and hsCRP concentration (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.0-1.04, P=0.03) at diagnosis. DISCUSSION: HsCRP might be a useful diagnostic marker in differentiating active IBD from other diseases. Particularly important however seems to be the predictive value of hsCRP at diagnosis in prognosing the clinical outcome of the disease in CD patients.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are a subject of great interest in gastroenterology, due to a pathological mechanism that is difficult to explain and an optimal therapeutic approach still undiscovered. Crohn's disease (CD) is one of the main entities in IBD, characterized by clinical polymorphism and great variability in the treatment response. Modern theories on the pathogenesis of CD have proven that gut microbiome and environmental factors lead to an abnormal immune response in a genetically predisposed patient. Genome-wide association studies in patients with CD worldwide revealed several genetic mutations that increase the risk of IBD and that predispose to a more severe course of disease. Gut microbiota is considered a compulsory and an essential part in the pathogenesis of CD. Intestinal dysmicrobism with excessive amounts of different bacterial strains can be found in all patients with IBD. The discovery of Escherichia coli entero-invasive on resection pieces in patients with CD now increases the likelihood of antimicrobial or vaccine-type treatments. Recent studies targeting intestinal immunology and its molecular activation pathways provide new possibilities for therapeutics. In addition to antitumor necrosis factor molecules, which were a breakthrough in IBD, improving mucosal healing and resection-free survival rate, other classes of therapeutic agents come to focus. Leukocyte adhesion inhibitors block the leukocyte homing mechanism and prevent cellular immune response. In addition to anti-integrin antibodies, chemokine receptor antagonists and SMAD7 antisense oligonucleotides have shown encouraging results in clinical trials. Micro-RNAs have demonstrated their role as disease biomarkers but it could also become useful for the treatment of IBD. Moreover, cellular therapy is another therapeutic approach under development, aimed for severe refractory CD. Other experimental treatments include intravenous immunoglobulins, exclusive enteral nutrition, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors.},

   abstract = {Many immune-based intestinal disorders, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, as well as other illnesses, may have the intestines as an initial cause or aggravator in the development of diseases, even apparently not correlating directly to the intestine. Diabetes, obesity, multiple sclerosis, depression, and anxiety are examples of other illnesses discussed in the literature. In parallel, importance of the gut microbiota in intestinal homeostasis and immunologic conflict between tolerance towards commensal microorganisms and combat of pathogens is well known. Recent researches show that the immune system, when altered by the gut microbiota, influences the state in which these diseases are presented in the patient directly and indirectly. At the present moment, a considerable number of investigations about this subject have been performed and published. However, due to difficulties on correlating information, several speculations and hypotheses are generated. Thus, the present review aims at bringing together how these interactions work-gut microbiota, immune system, and their influence in the neuroimmune system.},

   abstract = {Over the last 10-15 years, our understanding of the composition and functions of the human gut microbiota has increased exponentially. To a large extent, this has been due to new 'omic' technologies that have facilitated large-scale analysis of the genetic and metabolic profile of this microbial community, revealing it to be comparable in influence to a new organ in the body and offering the possibility of a new route for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, it might be more accurate to think of it like an immune system: a collection of cells that work in unison with the host and that can promote health but sometimes initiate disease. This review gives an update on the current knowledge in the area of gut disorders, in particular metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disease, liver disease, IBD and colorectal cancer. The potential of manipulating the gut microbiota in these disorders is assessed, with an examination of the latest and most relevant evidence relating to antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols and faecal microbiota transplantation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Both science and patients associate diet with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. There is no doubt that links between IBD and diet are numerous, based on both epidemiological studies and experimental studies. However, scientific evidence to support dietary advice is currently lacking, and dietary counselling for IBD patients is often limited in clinical practice to the improvement of nutrient intake. This review aimed to focus on both patient's beliefs about and molecular mechanisms for crosstalk between nutrients and inflammation. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed was performed to identify relevant studies on diet and/or nutrients and their role in IBD. Pubmed [from inception to January 20, 2016] was searched using the terms: 'Crohn', 'colitis',' intestinal epithelial cells', and a list of terms relating to diet or numerous specific nutrients. Terms associated with nutrients were individually tested in the context of IBD. Reference lists from studies selected were manually searched to identify further relevant reports. Manuscripts about diet in the context of IBD from basic science, epidemiological studies, or clinical trials were selected and reviewed. Only articles published in English were included. RESULTS: Epidemiological studies highlight the key role of diet in IBD development, and many IBD patients report diet as a triggering factor in relapse of disease. In addition, we present research on the impact of nutrients on innate immunity. CONCLUSION: Diet may offer an alternative approach to restoring deficient innate immunity in IBD, and this may be the scientific rationale for providing dietary counselling for IBD patients.},

It has also been reported that the minor G allele from the rs12212067 polymorphism (T>G) in FOXO3 is associated with milder CD. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the rs12212067 polymorphism and food intolerances for a total of 253 foods. METHODS: Tolerances and intolerances were recorded on a self-reported dietary questionnaire. Each food was scored on a 5-point ordinal scale: beneficial effects as '+ +' or '+', adverse effects as '- -' or '-', and 'makes no difference' as '='. Dietary and genotype data were available for a total of 283 CD patients. RESULTS: We identified 17 foods with beneficial effects in our study which were significantly associated with the G allele of the FOXO3 rs12212067 polymorphism. Of these, sweet potatoes had the highest reported frequency of beneficial responses. We also identified 4 foods with detrimental effects in more than 25% of our study population. These were mustard, wasabi, and raw and cooked tomatoes, which again were significantly associated with the G allele in FOXO3. CONCLUSIONS: There was strong evidence that adverse effects of mustard, wasabi, and raw and cooked tomatoes were significantly associated with the G allele of FOXO3 and that these foods should be avoided by people carrying this allele.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: After resection surgery for Crohn's disease, recurrence of endoscopic lesions at the site of the anastomosis or in the neoterminal ileum is graded according to the Rutgeerts score (RS). The goal of this study was to test the interobserver variability for RS. METHODS: Thirteen trained endoscopists evaluated the RS on 39 videotapes of patients who had undergone resection for Crohn's disease with an ileocolonic anastomosis 6 months earlier. Videotapes were randomly assigned to endoscopists through a balanced incomplete block design. Each videotape was scored independently by four endoscopists, and each endoscopist evaluated 12 videotapes, making a total of 156 videotape assessments. Reproducibility levels of the RS were assessed through unweighted kappa estimates among multiple raters. The proportion of inappropriate therapeutic initiation was estimated by randomly selecting one endoscopist for each videorecording, assuming that the majority of endoscopists correctly classified endoscopic recurrence. RESULTS: The kappa estimates were 0.43 (95% confidence interval: 0.33-0.52) for the RS on a 5-grade scale, 0.47 (0.28-0.66) for RS < i2 vs. >/= i2, and 0.64 (0.42-0.85) for RS </= i2 vs. > i2. The percentages of inappropriate therapeutic initiation were 12.8% (3.8-21.9) when initiation was triggered by a RS >/= i2 and 8.3% (1.1-15.6) when initiation was triggered by a RS > i2 (p = 0.41). CONCLUSION: The reproducibility of the RS was moderate, especially when differentiating <i2 from >/=i2, which may lead to incorrect therapeutic decisions in >10% of patients.},

Urinary metabonomics was applied in order to better understand metabolic changes between healthy and IBD children. METHODS: 21 Pediatric patients with IBD (mean age 14.8 years, 8 males) were enrolled from the Pediatric Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic over two years. Clinical and biological data were collected at baseline, 6, and 12 months. 27 healthy children (mean age 12.9 years, 16 males) were assessed at baseline. Urine samples were collected at each visit and subjected to (1)H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. RESULTS: Using (1)H NMR metabonomics, we determined that urine metabolic profiles of IBD children differ significantly from healthy controls. Metabolic differences include central energy metabolism, amino acid, and gut microbial metabolic pathways. The analysis described that combined urinary urea and phenylacetylglutamine-two readouts of nitrogen metabolism-may be relevant to monitor metabolic status in the course of disease. CONCLUSION: Non-invasive sampling of urine followed by metabonomic profiling can elucidate and monitor the metabolic status of children in relation to disease status. Further developments of omic-approaches in pediatric research might deliver novel nutritional and metabolic hypotheses.},

While iron deficiency anemia is predominant, combinations of hematimetric and biochemical markers enable detection and targeted therapy of other etiologies including vitamin B12/folic acid deficiencies, hemolysis, myelosuppression and pharmacotherapies. Areas covered: Current literature was searched for articles focusing on etiology, diagnostics and therapy of anemia in IBD. In the light of their own experience, the authors describe the physiology of anemia in IBD and present current evidence endorsing diagnostic and therapeutic options, focusing particularly on non-iron-related etiologies. Expert commentary: Anemia in IBD is polyetiological, reaching far beyond iron deficiency anemia. While clinicians need to be aware of the increasing pallet of diagnostic tools and therapeutic options, detailed studies are needed to develop more convenient test procedures, long-term treatment and monitoring strategies, and unified guidelines for daily practice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few case reports describe the clinical features of pancreatic involvement in inflammatory bowel disease. AIM: To investigate prevalence and disease course of inflammatory bowel disease children with pancreatitis and with exclusive hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. METHODS: We used a web-registry to retrospectively identify paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients with hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. Participants were re-evaluated at 6 months and 1 year. RESULTS: From a total of 649 paediatric patients, we found 27 with hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia (4.1%). Eleven patients (1.6%) fulfilled diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis. Female gender was significantly associated with acute pancreatitis (p=0.04). Twenty-five children (92.5%) had colonic disease. At 6 months 1/11 children with acute pancreatitis (9%) showed acute recurrent pancreatitis, while 1 patient (9%) had persistent hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. At 12 months, 1 patient showed chronic pancreatitis (9.1%). Of the 16 children with exclusive hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia, 4 developed acute pancreatitis (25%), while 1 patient (6.2%) still presented exclusive hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia at 6 months. At 12 months, 11/16 patients (68.7%) reached a remission of pancreatic involvement, whereas 5 remaining patients (32.3%) had persistent hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. CONCLUSIONS: In inflammatory bowel disease children, acute pancreatitis is more common in colonic disease and in female gender. Pancreatic function should be monitored, considering that pancreatic damage may evolve.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic pathology that has an outbreaks course that in recent years have seen an increase in incidence, especially at younger ages. Malnutrition is frequently associated with this condition, therefore, it is very important to ensure a right nutritional intervention, especially in pediatric patients, to ensure an optimal growth and also an improvement in the clinic. Our goal will be updated the role of nutrition in this disease and in its treatment based on the published evidence. Malnutrition in these patients is frequent and is influenced by various factors such as, decreased food intake, increased nutrient requirements, increased protein loss and malabsorption of nutrients. Therefore there should be a nutritional monitoring of all of them, in which anthropometric measurements, laboratory tests and densitometry were made to establish the needs and sufficient caloric intake tailored to each patient. The use of enteral nutrition as a treatment in Crohn's disease with mild to moderate outbreak in child population, is amply demonstrated, has even shown to be superior to the use of corticosteroids. Therefore we can conclude by stressing that nutritional intervention is a mainstay in the management of patients with IBD, which aims to prevent and / or control disease-related malnutrition to decrease morbidity and mortality and improve quality of life.},

   abstract = {Probiotics and prebiotics, mainly commercialised as food ingredients and also as supplements, are considered highly profitable niche markets. However, in recent years, the food industry has suffered from a series of health claim restrictions on probiotics and prebiotics in many parts of the world, including those made by the European Food Safety Authority. Therefore, we reviewed the core benefits of probiotic and prebiotic consumption on health. A number of studies have examined the prevention and/or management of intestinal infections, respiratory tract infections, CVD, osteoporosis, urogenital infections, cavities, periodontal disease and halitosis, allergic reactions, inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori gastric infections. In fact, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in human microbiota and immune system modulation by probiotics and prebiotics relies on continuous efforts to establish suitable biomarkers of health and diseases risk factors for the design of clinical trials required for health claim approval. In spite of the promising results, the performance of large, long-term, well-planned, well-aligned clinical studies is crucial to provide more reliability and a more solid basis for the outcomes achieved and to support the potential use of probiotics and prebiotics in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fibrostenosis and stricture are well-recognized endpoints in Crohn's disease (CD). We hypothesized that stricturing CD is characterized by eosinophilia and epithelial IL-33. We proposed that eosinophil exposure to IL-33 would perpetuate inflammatory chronicity and subsequent fibrostenosis. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 74 children with inflammatory and stricturing ileal CD comparing clinicopathological features to immunohistochemical measures of eosinophilia and IL-33. To scrutinize eosinophil patterns, we developed a novel eosinophil peroxidase score encompassing number, distribution, and degranulation. Human eosinophils and intestinal fibroblasts were cultured with IL-33 and IL-13, and inflammatory and remodeling parameters were assessed. Antieosinophil therapy was also administered to the Crohn's-like ileitis model (SAMP1/SkuSlc). RESULTS: Our novel eosinophil peroxidase score was more sensitive than H&E staining, revealing significant differences in eosinophil patterns, comparing inflammatory and stricturing pediatric CD. A significant relationship between ileal eosinophilia and complicated clinical/histopathological phenotype including fibrosis was determined. IL-33 induced significant eosinophil peroxidase secretion and IL-13 production. Exposure to eosinophils in the presence of IL-33, "primed" fibroblasts to increase proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6), eosinophil-associated chemokines (CCL24 and CCL26), and IL-13Ralpha2 production. Production of fibrogenic molecules (collagen 1A2, fibronectin, and periostin) increased after exposure of "primed" fibroblasts to IL-13. Epithelial-IL-33 was increased in pediatric Crohn's ileitis and strongly associated with clinical and histopathological activity, ileal eosinophilia, and complicated fibrostenotic disease. SAMP1/SkuSlc eosinophil-targeted treatment resulted in significant improvements in inflammation and remodeling. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of specimens from pediatric patients with ileal CD linked eosinophil patterns and IL-33 to fibrosis and suggested that these may contribute to the perpetuation of inflammation and subsequent stricture in pediatric CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Diverting ileostomy is used as a temporizing therapy in patients with perianal Crohn disease; however, little data exist regarding its use for colonic disease. The primary aim of the present study was to determine the role of diversion in severe refractory colonic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a pediatric population. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients who underwent diverting ileostomy at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from 2000 to 2014 for the management of severe, refractory colonic IBD. Clinical variables were compared in the 1 year before ileostomy and 1 year after diversion. Surgical and disease outcomes including changes in diagnosis were reviewed through 2015. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients underwent diverting ileostomy for refractory colonic disease. Initial diagnoses were Crohn disease in 10 (42%), ulcerative colitis in 1 (4%), and IBD-unclassified in 13 patients (54%). Comparing data before and after surgery, there were statistically significant improvements in height and weight velocities, height velocity z score, blood transfusion requirement, hemoglobin, and hospitalization rates. Chronic steroid use decreased from 71% to 22%. At the conclusion of the study, 10 patients had undergone subsequent colectomy, 7 had successful bowel reanastomosis, and 7 remain diverted. Seven patients (29%) had a change in diagnosis. There were 13 surgical complications in 7 subjects, including prolapse reduction, stoma revision, and resection of ischemic bowel. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients with refractory colonic IBD, diverting ileostomy can be a successful intervention to induce clinical stability. Importantly, diversion is a steroid-sparing therapy and allows additional time to clarify the diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perineal wound complications after ileoanal pouch excision remain a significant cause of morbidity. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to describe the incidence, outcomes, and predictors of perineal wound complications after pouch excision. DESIGN: This was a retrospective medical chart review. SETTINGS: The study was conducted in a single clinical institution. PATIENTS: Patients who underwent pouch excision at our institution from July 1992 through July 2012 were identified. Patient and perioperative variables were reviewed. Multivariate and univariate analyses were undertaken. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perineal wound (including perineal wound infection and persistent perineal sinus [nonhealing by 6 months]) and perineal hernia were measured. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients (mean age, 46 years; 42.6% men) with familial adenomatous polyposis (10.6%), mucosal ulcerative colitis (61.7%), or Crohn's disease (27.7%) underwent pouch excision, including 36.2% for IPAA-related sepsis (presacral abscess; perineal-, sacral-, or pouch-vaginal fistula; and anastomotic defect), 44.7% for pouch dysfunction, 10.6% for refractory pouchitis, and 8.5% for neoplasia. Fourteen (29.8%) developed perineal wound complications, including 100% perineal wound infection, 28.6% persistent perineal sinus, and 7.1% perineal hernia. Perineal wound infection was associated with delayed healing (>6 weeks; 71.4% vs 24.2%; p = 0.002) and IPAA-related sepsis (28.6% vs 0%; p = 0.001). Patients with and without perineal wound complications were similar in age, diagnoses, fecal diversion, immunosuppression, comorbid conditions, nutrition, and surgical variables. Most patients underwent intersphincteric dissection (87.2%) with primary perineal closure (97.0%). Perineal wound complications were significantly associated with IPAA-related sepsis as an indication for pouch excision (57.1% vs 27.2%; p = 0.05), intraoperative pouch perforation (35.7% vs 9.1%, p =0.03), and smoking (21.4% vs 3.0%; p = 0.04). IPAA-related sepsis and a current smoking status (OR, 19.3 [95% CI, 1.8 -488.1]) are significant independent predictors on multivariate logistic regression (OR, 6.4 [95% CI, 1.4-30.2]) of perineal wound complications. All of the patients with persistent perineal sinus achieved successful healing at a median of 734 days (range, 363-2182 days), requiring a median of 1.5 procedures. LIMITATIONS: This was a single-center retrospective review with a small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative IPAA-related sepsis and current smoking are significant risk factors for perineal wound complications after pouch excision.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are heterogeneous disorders with complex aetiology. Quantitative genetic studies suggest that only a small proportion of the disease variance observed in IBD is accounted for by genetic variation, indicating a potential role for differential epigenetic regulation in disease aetiology. The aim of this study was to assess genome-wide DNA methylation changes specifically associated with ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and IBD activity. METHODS: DNA methylation was quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 149 IBD cases (61 UC, 88 CD) and 39 controls using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Technical and functional validation was performed using pyrosequencing and the real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cross-tissue replication of the top differentially methylated positions (DMPs) was tested in colonic mucosa tissue samples obtained from paediatric IBD cases and controls. RESULTS: A total of 3196 probes were differentially methylated between CD cases and controls, while 1481 probes were differentially methylated between UC cases and controls. There was considerable (45%) overlap between UC and CD DMPs. The top-ranked IBD-associated PBMC differentially methylated region (promoter region of TRIM39-RPP2) was also significantly hypomethylated in colonic mucosa from paediatric UC patients. In addition, we confirmed TRAF6 hypermethylation using pyrosequencing and found reduced TRAF6 gene expression in PBMCs of IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide new insights into differential epigenetic regulation of genes and molecular pathways, which may contribute to the pathogenesis and activity of IBD.},

   abstract = {The regulation of T cell and DC retention and lymphatic egress within and from the intestine is critical for intestinal immunosurveillance; however, the cellular processes that orchestrate this balance during IBD remain poorly defined. With the use of a mouse model of TNF-driven Crohn's-like ileitis (TNF(Delta) (ARE)), we examined the role of CCR7 in the control of intestinal T cell and DC retention/egress during experimental CD. We observed that the frequency of CCR7-expressing TH1/TH17 effector lymphocytes increased during active disease in TNF(Delta) (ARE) mice and that DeltaARE/CCR7(-/-) mice developed exacerbated ileitis and multiorgan inflammation, with a marked polarization and ileal retention of TH1 effector CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of DeltaARE/CCR7(-/-) effector CD4(+) into lymphopenic hosts resulted in ileo-colitis, whereas those transferred with DeltaARE/CCR7(+/+) CD4(+) T cells developed ileitis. DeltaARE/CCR7(-/-) mice had an acellular draining MLN, decreased CD103(+) DC, and decreased expression of RALDH enzymes and of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) Tregs. Lastly, a mAb against CCR7 exacerbated ileitis in TNF(Delta) (ARE) mice, phenocopying the effects of congenital CCR7 deficiency. Our data underscore a critical role for the lymphoid chemokine receptor CCR7 in orchestrating immune cell traffic and TH1 versus TH17 bias during chronic murine ileitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Repetitive interaction with microbial stimuli renders epithelial cells (ECs) hyporesponsive to microbial stimulation. Previously, we have reported that buccal ECs from a subset of paediatric patients with Crohn's disease are not hyporesponsive and spontaneously released chemokines. We now aimed to identify kinetics and mechanisms of acquisition of hyporesponsiveness to microbial stimulation using primary human buccal epithelium. DESIGN: Buccal ECs collected directly after birth and in later stages of life were investigated. Chemokine release and regulatory signalling pathways were studied using primary buccal ECs and the buccal EC line TR146. Findings were extended to the intestinal mucosa using murine model systems. RESULTS: Directly after birth, primary human buccal ECs spontaneously produced the chemokine CXCL-8 and were responsive to microbial stimuli. Within the first weeks of life, these ECs attained hyporesponsiveness, associated with inactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway and upregulation of the novel NF-kappaB inhibitor SLPI but no other known NF-kappaB inhibitors. SLPI protein was abundant in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of hyporesponsive buccal ECs. Knock-down of SLPI in TR146-buccal ECs induced loss of hyporesponsiveness with increased NF-kappaB activation and subsequent chemokine release. This regulatory mechanism extended to the intestine, as colonisation of germfree mice elicited SLPI expression in small intestine and colon. Moreover, SLPI-deficient mice had increased chemokine expression in small intestinal and colonic ECs. CONCLUSIONS: We identify SLPI as a new player in acquisition of microbial hyporesponsiveness by buccal and intestinal epithelium in the first weeks after microbial colonisation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There have been no previous reports assessing the effectiveness of azathioprine (AZA) in the treatment of orofacial granulomatosis (OFG). This report is a review of patients receiving AZA for active OFG with or without concomitant gut Crohn's disease (CD) in a specialist tertiary referral centre. METHODS: Clinical response was defined by Global Physician Assessment at 4-, 12- and 24-month follow-up and a standardised oral disease activity score (ODAS). RESULTS: Sixty of 215 patients seen with OFG in our clinic over a 12-year period were treated with AZA. Of these, 22 had concomitant CD. The proportion of patients responding to AZA with a diagnosis of CD/OFG vs. OFG only at 4, 12 and 24 months were 54% vs. 21% (P = 0.03), 59% vs. 21% (P = 0.003) and 41% vs. 24% (P = 0.16), respectively. A statistically significant difference was seen between starting and follow-up ODAS scores at 4 months in the CD/OFG group which was not observed in the OFG only group. Factors predicting a need for AZA included a diagnosis of intestinal CD, sulcal swelling, sulcal ulcers and upper lip involvement. The factor predicting response to treatment was a diagnosis of CD at 12 months of follow-up. No difference in the number of adverse effects was observed between the two groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: AZA is significantly more effective in the treatment of oral disease with a concurrent diagnosis of CD rather than in the treatment of OFG alone.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a rare, inflammatory disorder of the mouth, in which some patients also have intestinal Crohn's disease (CD). The etiology remains largely unknown, although there is a high prevalence of atopy, and oral granulomas are also seen in other immune disorders particularly CD and sarcoidosis. We investigated whether genetic variants associated with an increased risk of CD, sarcoidosis, or atopy were also associated with susceptibility to OFG. METHODS: Patients were stratified clinically as isolated oral manifestations (OFG only) or concurrent intestinal CD (OFG+CD). We genotyped 201 patients and 1023 healthy controls for risk variants in NOD2, IRGM, IL23R, ATG16L1 (CD), BTNL2 (sarcoidosis), and FLG (atopy). The coding regions of the NOD2 gene were screened for rare, potentially pathogenic variants in OFG. RESULTS: A combined analysis of 3 CD-risk variants in NOD2 showed no association with any OFG subgroup. NOD2 p.L1007insC was associated with OFG+CD (P = 0.023) and IL23R p.R381Q with all OFG (P = 0.031). The sarcoidosis risk variant rs2076530 in BTNL2 was associated with all OFG (P = 0.013). We identified 7 rare missense NOD2 alleles in 8 individuals with OFG, 4 OFG-only patients and 4 patients with OFG+CD. There was a significant enrichment of NOD2 variants in the OFG+CD group compared to the OFG-only group (P = 0.008, common variants; P = 0.04, all common and rare variants). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that genetic variants in NOD2 are only associated with OFG in patients with concurrent intestinal disease. A genome-wide association scan is needed to fully define the genetic architecture of OFG.},

We describe here the use of golimumab (Simponi) in 6 pediatric CD patients with antibody formation/loss of response to infliximab and adalimumab. Most patients had undergone surgery but had poor disease control. After introduction of golimumab, the levels of inflammatory markers and fecal calprotectin declined at first, but the response was not sustained. Each patient needed dose escalation of golimumab from 4 to 2 week intervals, to maintain response and to increase trough levels. Importantly, most patients were able to attend school when undergoing golimumab therapy. As with other anti-TNFalpha drugs, follow-up of drug levels is advisable. Although golimumab therapy failed in most patients, it is an alternate treatment option in pediatric patients with severe CD. The therapeutic response, however, is suboptimal in anti-TNFalpha exposed patients.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate whether accelerated catabolism of ganglioside and decreased ganglioside content contribute to the etiology of pro-inflammatory intestinal disease. METHODS: Intestinal mucosa from terminal ileum or colon was obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis or inflammatory Crohn's disease (n = 11) undergoing bowel resection and compared to control samples of normal intestine from patients with benign colon polyps (n = 6) and colorectal cancer (n = 12) in this observational case-control study. Gangliosides and phospholipids of intestinal mucosa were characterized by class and ceramide or fatty acid composition using liquid chromatography triple-quad mass spectrometry. Content and composition of ganglioside classes GM1, GM3, GD3, GD1a, GT1 and GT3 were compared among subject groups. Content and composition of phospholipid classes phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine were compared among subject groups. Unsaturation index of individual ganglioside and phospholipid classes was computed and compared among subject groups. Ganglioside catabolism enzymes beta-hexosaminidase A (HEXA) and sialidase-3 (NEU3) were measured in intestinal mucosa using western blot and compared among subject groups. RESULTS: Relative GM3 ganglioside content was 2-fold higher (P < 0.05) in intestine from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared to control intestine. The quantity of GM3 and ratio of GM3/GD3 was also higher in IBD intestine than control tissue (P < 0.05). Control intestine exhibited 3-fold higher (P < 0.01) relative GD1a ganglioside content than IBD intestine. GD3 and GD1a species of ganglioside containing three unsaturated bonds were present in control intestine, but were not detected in IBD intestine. The relative content of PC containing more than two unsaturated bonds was 30% lower in IBD intestine than control intestine (P < 0.05). The relative content of HEXA in IBD intestine was increased 1.7-fold (P < 0.05) and NEU3 was increased 8.3-fold (P < 0.01) compared to normal intestine. Intestinal mucosa in IBD is characterized by increased GM3 content, decreased GD1a, and a reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acid constituents in GD3, GD1a and PC. CONCLUSION: This study suggests a new paradigm by proposing that IBD occurs as a consequence of increased metabolism of specific gangliosides.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies reveal associations between intestinal ganglioside content and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since a low level of ganglioside is associated with higher production of proinflammatory signals in the intestine, it is important to determine safety and bioavailability of dietary ganglioside for application as a potential therapeutic agent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy volunteers (HVs; n = 18) completed an 8-week supplementation study to demonstrate safety and bioavailabity of ganglioside consumption. HVs were randomized to consume a milk fat fraction containing 43 mg/d ganglioside or placebo, and patients with IBD (n = 5) consumed ganglioside supplement in a small pilot study. Plasma gangliosides were characterized using reverse-phase liquid chromatography-QQQ mass spectrometry. Intestinal permeability was assessed by oral lactulose/mannitol, and quality of life was assessed by quality of life in the IBD questionnaire. RESULTS: There were no adverse events associated with dietary ganglioside intake. Ganglioside consumption increased ( P < .05) plasma content of total GD3 by 35% over 8 weeks. HVs consuming ganglioside exhibited a 19% decrease in intestinal permeability ( P = .04). Consumption of ganglioside was associated with a 39% increase ( P < .01) in emotional health and a 36% improvement ( P < .02) in systemic symptoms in patients with IBD. CONCLUSION: Impaired intestinal integrity characteristic of IBD results in increased permeability to bacterial antigens and decreased nutrient absorption. Intestinal integrity may be improved by dietary treatment with specific species of ganglioside. Ganglioside is a safe, bioavailable dietary compound that can be consumed to potentially improve quality of life in patients with IBD and treat other disorders involving altered ganglioside metabolism.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that CD64 surface expression on circulating neutrophils is significantly elevated in children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease (CD). Our primary aim was to investigate whether elevations in neutrophil CD64 in asymptomatic patients could be used to predict treatment failure during maintenance infliximab. METHODS: Pediatric CD subjects receiving maintenance infliximab in clinical remission (short pediatric CD activity index [shPCDAI] <15) were enrolled. We measured neutrophil CD64 expression (CD64 index, Trillium Diagnostics, LLC) and infliximab trough concentrations. Infliximab failure was defined as an shPCDAI >15 on 2 consecutive infusions, discontinuation of infliximab, hospitalization, endoscopic ulcerations, or surgery during the following year of maintenance infliximab. RESULTS: We enrolled 36 subjects, 22/36 were male and 29/36 were white. Mean (SD) age at study entry was 15 (4) years with a median of 14 (5-20) infusions before study entry. 4/36 were receiving a concurrent immunomodulator. Over 1 year, 15/36 subjects were classified as infliximab failures. Asymptomatic subjects with a neutrophil CD64 index >1 at study entry had a higher probability of treatment failure compared with asymptomatic subjects with a CD64 index <1 (log-rank = 0.002). We found only neutrophil CD64 index >1 and nonwhite race were risk factors for treatment failure by univariate regression analysis. We found no difference in the mean infliximab trough concentration at study entry between treatment failures (2.8 mug/mL, SD, 1.2) and subjects remaining in remission on infliximab (4.2 mug/mL, SD, 3.4; P = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophil CD64 index >1 is a significant risk factor for treatment failure during infliximab maintenance therapy.},

We conducted a review to evaluate the utility of TDM in the assessment and subsequent management of IFX loss of response in our pediatric population with Crohn disease (CD). METHODS: Single-center retrospective study of patients with CD receiving IFX that had TDM from December 2009 to September 2013. We defined subtherapeutic trough as a drug level below the detection limit of the Prometheus enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay and Anser reference values (1.4 and 1 mug/mL, respectively) or a mid-interval level <12 mug/mL. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-one IFX concentration tests were performed on 72 patients with CD with loss of response to therapy as the primary indication (72%). 34% of all TDM were subtherapeutic. After initial TDM, 25 of the 72 patients received regimen intensification with 72% in clinical remission at 6 months. Including all of the TDM that resulted in IFX dose intensification, we found a significant improvement in 6-month remission rates whether intensification followed mid-interval (88% remission) or trough (56% remission) testing (P = 0.026). Antibody to infliximab was found in 14 patients with 5 occurring in the first year of therapy. Furthermore, 71% of patients with antibody to infliximab that were switched to an alternative anti-tumor necrosis factor achieved clinical remission at six months. In multivariable regression analysis, we found IFX dose (mg/kg), IFX dosing frequency (weeks), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate at the previous infusion were significantly associated with the IFX concentration. CONCLUSIONS: TDM in our pediatric population with CD led to informed clinical decisions and improved rates of clinical remission.},

   abstract = {The intestinal epithelium of adult humans acts as a differentially permeable barrier that separates the potentially harmful contents of the lumen from the underlying tissues. Any dysfunction of this boundary layer that disturbs the homeostatic equilibrium between the internal and external environments may initiate and sustain a biochemical cascade that results in inflammation of the intestine. Key to such dysfunction are genetic, microbial and other environmental factors that, singularly or in combination, result in chronic inflammation that is symptomatic of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the present review is to assess the scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that defective transepithelial transport mechanisms and the heightened absorption of intact antigenic proinflammatory oligopeptides are important contributing factors in the pathogenesis of IBD.},

In recent years, therapeutic goal evolved from clinical remission to mucosal healing and deep remission. In order to achieve remission, it is important to appropriately choose and use available drugs. Therefore, anti-TNFalpha treatment should be rapidly used for severe and at-risk patients, sometimes in association with thiopurines or methotrexate. The monitoring of through levels and antibodies to anti-TNFalpha is relevant to optimize the treatment and to reduce drug inefficacy. However, the development of new drugs is required to offer alternative tools to severe and refractory patients.},

   abstract = {Objective Conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are well known to cause severe gastrointestinal toxicities that often disturb the oral intake of the patients followed by poor nutrition and life-threatening infection. An oral elemental diet (ED) is an easily consumed and assimilated form of liquid nutrients mainly composed of amino acids. It alleviates the digestive loading from the intestine and is mainly used for enteral nutritional support in patients with Crohn's disease. We herein report, for the first time, the efficacy of ED for patients undergoing HSCT. Methods We evaluated the efficacy of ED in a prospective cohort study. The primary endpoint for this study was the hospitalization period. The secondary endpoint was the occurrence of oral mucositis, nausea, diarrhea and fever. Patients A total of 73 patients were consecutively enrolled between March 2011 and March 2013. Twenty-three patients underwent autologous HSCT and 50 patients underwent allogeneic HSCT. The first 21 patients did not receive ED (non-ED group; NEG) while in the successive 52 patients (ED group; EG), oral ED was started before conditioning and was continued until 28 days after transplantation. Results The patient characteristics were similar between the two groups. The mean duration of ED administration for EG was 28.7 days (range, 3-37 days), and the mean total-dose of ED administration was 1904 g (range, 240-2,960 g). The median hospitalization period was significantly shorter in EG compared to NEG, (34 days vs. 50 days; p=0.007). Grade 3-4 oral mucositis occurred less in EG than NEG (25% vs. 48%; p=0.06). Conclusion Oral ED may promote an early mucosal recovery and thereby shorten the duration of hospitalization.},

   abstract = {Eosinophils are traditionally studied in the context of type 2 immune responses. However, recent studies highlight key innate immune functions for eosinophils especially in colonic inflammation. Surprisingly, molecular pathways regulating innate immune activities of eosinophil are largely unknown. We have recently shown that the CD300f is highly expressed by colonic eosinophils. Nonetheless, the role of CD300f in governing innate immune eosinophil activities is ill-defined. RNA sequencing of 162 pediatric Crohn's disease patients revealed upregulation of multiple Cd300 family members, which correlated with the presence of severe ulcerations and inflammation. Increased expression of CD300 family receptors was also observed in active ulcerative colitis (UC) and in mice following induction of experimental colitis. Specifically, the expression of CD300f was dynamically regulated in monocytes and eosinophils. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-treated Cd300f-/- mice exhibit attenuated disease activity and histopathology in comparison with DSS-treated wild type (WT). Decreased disease activity in Cd300f-/- mice was accompanied with reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and nearly abolished production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Monocyte depletion and chimeric bone marrow transfer experiments revealed a cell-specific requirement for CD300f in innate immune activation of eosinophils. Collectively, we uncover a new pathway regulating innate immune activities of eosinophils, a finding with significant implications in eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal diseases.},

   abstract = {Intestinal microbial dysbiosis is associated with Crohn's disease (CD). However, the mechanisms leading to the chronic mucosal inflammation that characterizes this disease remain unclear. In this report, we use systems-level approaches to study the interactions between the gut microbiota and host in new-onset paediatric patients to evaluate causality and mechanisms of disease. We report an altered host proteome in CD patients indicative of impaired mitochondrial functions. In particular, mitochondrial proteins implicated in H2S detoxification are downregulated, while the relative abundance of H2S microbial producers is increased. Network correlation analysis reveals that Atopobium parvulum controls the central hub of H2S producers. A. parvulum induces pancolitis in colitis-susceptible interleukin-10-deficient mice and this phenotype requires the presence of the intestinal microbiota. Administrating the H2S scavenger bismuth mitigates A. parvulum-induced colitis in vivo. This study reveals that host-microbiota interactions are disturbed in CD and thus provides mechanistic insights into CD pathogenesis.},

This systematic review discusses approaches, challenges and perspectives into the use of nontraditional antioxidant therapy on IBD, including natural and synthetic compounds in both human and animal models. One hundred and thirty four papers were identified, of which only four were evaluated in humans. Some of the challenges identified in this review can shed light on this fact: lack of standardization of OS biomarkers, absence of safety data and clinical trials for the chemicals and biological molecules, as well as the fact that most of the compounds were not repeatedly tested in several situations, including acute and chronic colitis. This review hopes to stimulate researchers to become more involved in this fruitful area, to warrant investigation of novel, alternative and efficacious antioxidant-based therapies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the MR enterographic findings that best correlate with mucosal healing assessed with ileocolonoscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with Crohn disease who underwent two ileocolonoscopic examinations and also underwent MR enterography close in time to the second endoscopic examination were included in a retrospective study. Two pediatric gastroenterologists blinded to the imaging findings reviewed the endoscopic examinations to assess for mucosal healing, defined as resolution of inflammation within a bowel segment at subsequent ileocolonoscopy. Two radiologists blinded to endoscopic and clinical data interpreted the MR enterographic images. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for mucosal healing were calculated for several imaging features. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients (15 female patients, 15 male patients; age range, 8-24 years; mean, 17.2 +/- 3.2 years) with pediatric-onset Crohn disease were examined. The average time between MR enterography and the second ileocolonoscopic examination was 12.7 +/- 7.9 days. A total of 202 bowel segments from the terminal ileum to rectum were evaluated in the 60 ileocolonoscopic examinations. Forty-four bowel segments exhibited mucosal healing, and 37 segments exhibited persistent inflammation. At imaging, the MR index of activity score in mucosal healing segments was 6.6 +/- 3.4, compared with 13.7 +/- 9.7 in segments without mucosal healing (p = 0.0001). The average bowel wall thickness in healing segments was 2.7 +/- 0.9 mm compared with 4.7 +/- 3.1 mm in persistently inflamed segments (p = 0.0004). An MR index of activity score less than 8 had the highest accuracy for mucosal healing (accuracy, 74%; sensitivity, 84%; specificity, 62%; p < 0.0001). Mucosal hyperenhancement (72%, 98%, 41%), mesenteric hypervascularity (72%, 98%, 41%), bowel wall edema (72%, 93%, 46%), and bowel wall thickness less than 4 mm (72%, 84%, 57%) were also strongly associated with mucosal healing (p < 0.0003). CONCLUSION: In this study MR enterography was accurate for assessing mucosal healing, an important therapeutic endpoint in pediatric patients with Crohn disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) may impair quality of life (QoL) in paediatric patients. We aimed to evaluate in a nationwide cohort whether patients experience QoL in a different way when compared with their parents. METHODS: Sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics were prospectively acquired from paediatric patients and their parents included in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study. Disease activity was evaluated by the Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI). We assessed QoL using the KIDSCREEN questionnaire. The QoL domains were analysed and compared between children and parents according to type of disease, parents' age, origin, education and marital status. RESULTS: We included 110 children and parents (59 Crohn's disease [CD], 45 ulcerative colitis [UC], 6 IBD unclassified [IBDU]). There was no significant difference in QoL between CD and UC/IBDU, whether the disease was active or in remission. Parents perceived overall QoL, as well as 'mood', 'family' and 'friends' domains, lower than the children themselves, independently of their place of birth and education. However, better concordance was found on 'school performance' and 'physical activity' domains. Marital status and age of parents significantly influenced the evaluation of QoL. Mothers and fathers being married or cohabiting perceived significantly lower mood, family and friends domains than their children, whereas mothers living alone had a lower perception of the friends domain; fathers living alone had a lower perception of family and mood subscores. CONCLUSION: Parents of Swiss paediatric IBD patients significantly underestimate overall QoL and domains of QoL of their children independently of origin and education.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Predicting short-term relapses and long-term prognosis is of utmost importance in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our aim was to investigate the short-term disease outcome and medication during the first year in a paediatric incident cohort from Hungary. In addition, association laboratory markers and disease activity indices with short-term disease outcome and medication were analysed. METHODS: From January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010, demographic data and clinical characteristics of newly diagnosed paediatric patients with IBD < 18 years of age were prospectively recorded. RESULTS: A total of 420 patients were identified (Crohn disease [CD] 266 and ulcerative colitis [UC] 124). Initially, 48% (124/256) of the patients with CD had moderate-to-severe disease (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] > 31), and this rate decreased to 2.1% at 1-year follow-up. Proportion of patients with UC with moderate-to-severe disease (Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index > 35) at diagnosis declined from 57.5% (69/120) to 6.8% at 1-year follow-up. Terminal ileal involvement correlated with higher initial C-reactive protein (CRP) (P = 0.021) and initial PCDAI (P = 0.026). In UC, elevated CRP (P = 0.002) was associated with disease extension. CRP and PCDAI at diagnosis were associated with the need for immunomodulators at 1 year in children with CD. Initial CRP was also associated with the need for immunomodulators in patients with UC at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: At diagnosis, half of the patients with IBD had moderate-to-severe disease, and this rate decreased to <10% after 1 year. Initial CRP and PCDAI were related to the need for aggressive therapy in CD.},

   abstract = {A 10 year old girl with diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss and fever of one month and a half of evolution. Analytical and sonographic findings raised the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease. Endoscopy and histology showed findings consistent with Crohn's disease. Treatment was initiated with mesalazine and exclusive enteral nutrition. Later corticosteroid treatment, immunosuppressive drugs and ursodeoxycholic acid were added due to cholestasis and persistent hypergammaglobulinemia. Magnetic resonance cholangiography and liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis. The association between Crohn's disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis is rare, predominantly in males between 20 and 40 years old and it presents a great clinical variability. The confirmation of the diagnosis requires magnetic resonance cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The prognosis is poor and there is no treatment to slow the progression of the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional status is an important consideration in many pediatric clinical conditions. This paper aimed to examine and compare the nutritional status, represented by body cell mass (BCM), of children with cancer, Crohn's disease (CD), cystic fibrosis (CF) and anorexia nervosa (AN). METHODS: Anthropometry was measured and BCM was calculated from whole body potassium-40 counting in 259 children being treated for clinical conditions (n = 66 cancer; n = 59 AN; n = 75 CF; n = 59 CD) and 108 healthy children. BCM was adjusted for height (BCMI) and expressed as a Z-score relative to laboratory reference data. RESULTS: The CD (-0.80 +/- 1.61; p = 0.0001) and AN (-1.13 +/- 0.99; p = 0.0001) groups had significantly lower BMI Z-score than the healthy control (0.13 +/- 0.75), cancer (0.50 +/- 1.40) and CF groups (-0.09 +/- 0.95). The cancer (-1.16 +/- 1.60; p = 0.0001), CD (-1.13 +/- 1.36; p = 0.0001) and AN (-0.97 +/- 1.18; p = 0.0001) groups had significantly reduced BCM compared to the healthy control (0.07 +/- 0.93) and CF group (0.31 +/- 1.08). According to BCMI Z-score, 42.4% of patients with cancer, 41.7% of the patients with CD, 27.1% of patients with AN, and 4.0% of patients with CF were considered malnourished. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that children undergoing treatment for clinical conditions may have alterations in BCM, independent of BMI. Children with cancer, CD and AN all had a high prevalence of malnutrition. Assessment of body composition, not just body size, is vital to understand nutritional status in children with clinical conditions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a term used to describe a persistent, painless swelling of lips and orofacial region. It can be associated with ulceration, gingival hypertrophy and cobble stone appearance of the buccal mucosa. OFG is commonly associated with Crohn's disease and can precede the intestinal manifestation of the disease. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a recognized treatment for induction of remission for Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to review the use of EEN in the management of OFG in children. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of all children diagnosed with OFG between 2007 and 2012 was conducted. Presence of comorbidities, progression to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and response to EEN was evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-nine children were included, mean age at diagnosis was 9 years (standard deviation 3.9) years. Ten children had isolated OFG and 19 had OFG and IBD, of which 12 presented with OFG and IBD and 7 developed IBD later. Median time to progression to IBD was 33 months (inter quartile range: 9.8-85.5). Twenty-two children completed 6 weeks of EEN, and 19 showed clinical improvement in the OFG appearance. CONCLUSION: EEN appears to be an effective treatment option for children with isolated OFG or OFG and IBD.},

METHODS: A total of 65 patients with CD from the Seoul National University Children's Hospital, from January 2000 to May 2012, and 72 unaffected controls were selected. Twelve different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed (TaqMan assay: ATG16L1 rs2241880, IRGM SNPs [rs13361189, rs4958847, rs1000113, rs10065172, and rs72553867], ULK1 SNPs [rs12303764, rs10902469, and rs7488085], NOD2 SNPs [Arg702Trp and Gly908Arg]; direct sequencing: NOD2 leu1007fsinsC). The onset age of patients was 8.6 +/- 4.7 years. Twelve patients (18.5%) had an onset age of <1 year. RESULTS: Two of the 12 SNPs showed significant results. IRGM rs1000113 exhibited an association with CD with respect to its minor allele frequency (odds ratio [OR] 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-2.79, P = 0.03) and genotype distribution (dominant model: OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.07-4.39, P = 0.03). IRGM rs72553867 exhibited association with CD with respect to its minor allele frequency (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.91, P = 0.02) and genotype distribution (dominant model: OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.23-0.94, P = 0.03). The 3 SNPs of NOD2 existed only as wild types for both groups. In the genotype-phenotype analysis, the onset age, disease location, and disease behavior exhibited no association. CONCLUSIONS: IRGM rs1000113 and IRGM rs72553867 exhibited associations with early-onset CD as risk loci and defense loci, respectively. This suggests that the autophagy pathway plays an important role in early-onset CD.},

   abstract = {Dietary influences may affect microbiome composition and host immune responses, thereby modulating propensity toward inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs): Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Dietary n-6 fatty acids have been associated with UC in prospective studies. However, the critical developmental period when (n-6) consumption may induce UC is not known. We examined the effects of transiently increased n-6 consumption during pediatric development on subsequent dextran-sulfate-sodium (DSS)-induced acute murine colitis. The animals transiently became obese then rapidly lost this phenotype. Interestingly, mice were protected against DSS colitis 40 days after n-6 consumption. The transient high n-6-induced protection against colitis was fat type- and dietary reversal-dependent and could be transferred to germ-free mice by fecal microbiota transplantation. We also detected decreased numbers of chemokine receptor (Cxcr)5(+) CD4(+) T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of transiently n-6-fed mice. Further experiments revealed that anti-chemokine ligand (Cxcl)13 (the ligand of Cxcr5) antibody treatment decreased DSS colitis severity, implicating the importance of the Cxcr5-Cxcl13 pathway in mammalian colitis. Consecutively, we found elevated CXCL13 concentrations (CD: 1.8-fold, P = 0.0077; UC: 1.9-fold, P = 0.056) in the serum of untreated pediatric IBD patients. The human serologic observations supported the translational relevance of our findings.},

   abstract = {Nutritional therapy is well established as a means to induce remission in active Crohn's disease (CD). Evidence indicates that exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) therapy for CD both alters the intestinal microbiota and directly suppresses the inflammatory response in the intestinal mucosa. However, the pathway(s) through which EEN suppresses inflammation is still unknown. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to use microarray technology to investigate the major pathway by which polymeric formula (PF) alters inflammatory processes in epithelial cells in vitro. HT-29 cells were grown to confluence and then co-cultured with tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (100 ng/ml) for 5 h in the presence or absence of PF, as used for EEN. Following incubation, RNA was extracted and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarray analysis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were employed to evaluate cytokine protein levels. Neither TNF-alpha nor PF had a toxic effect on cells over the experimental period. Microarray analysis showed that PF modulated the expression of genes specifically linked to nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, resulting in downregulation of a number of genes in this pathway. These findings were further confirmed by real-time PCR of selected dysregulated genes as well as reduced expression of IL-6 and IL-8 proteins following PF treatment. The results arising from this study provide evidence that PF alters the inflammatory responses in intestinal epithelial cells through modulation of the NF-kappaB pathway.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The value of enteral nutrition (EN) as maintenance therapy in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease (CD) has not been fully evaluated. The purpose of this study was to review the efficacy of EN for the maintenance of remission in patients with quiescent CD. METHODS: Seven prospective cohort studies evaluating the efficacy of EN for the maintenance of remission in quiescent CD were included. Three of the seven studies were randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). In all studies, patients used EN as a supplement or as a nocturnal tube feeding in addition to their normal food. RESULTS: One study compared the efficacy of elemental diet and polymeric diet. Elemental and polymeric diets were equally effective for the maintenance of clinical remission and for allowing tapering and cessation of steroid therapy. The other six studies compared the outcomes between patients treated with and without EN. The maintained clinical remission rate at 1 year was significantly higher in patients treated with EN in four of the six studies. Quantitative pooling of the studies was not feasible due to a small number of RCTs and a narrative account of the study characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Our review suggests that EN is useful for the maintenance of remission in patients with quiescent CD. However, there are several limitations in the reviewed studies. There are few RCTs. Further, the sample size is small, and the duration of intervention and follow-up is short. Large and well-designed RCTs should be conducted to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of EN for maintaining remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Esophageal Crohn's disease is reported as a rare manifestation, although its prevalence may be underestimated because upper endoscopies are not routinely performed in asymptomatic adults. Tofacitinib, an oral janus kinase inhibitor, is a new biologic that has shown promise in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and may be effective in the treatment of Crohn's disease according to phase 2 trials. We report the first case of esophageal Crohn's disease successfully treated with tofacitinib in a patient with worsening symptoms despite maintenance therapy with a tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor. CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old Caucasian woman presented with new dysphagia and had findings of esophageal Crohn's disease on endoscopy. The dosage of her current biologic therapy-adalimumab-was increased in frequency, without improvement. Our patient was started on tofacitinib and demonstrated an improvement in symptoms, with a repeat endoscopy showing resolution of the previous lesions. CONCLUSION: Esophageal Crohn's disease is likely underdiagnosed but is an important consideration in a patient with new symptoms of dysphagia and known Crohn's disease. Tofacitinib, while a novel agent, could have a role in the treatment of esophageal Crohn's disease that does not improve with intensification of the current biologic therapy. It provides a different mechanism in patients who become refractory to maintenance therapy.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has been to be more effective than corticosteroids in achieving mucosal healing without their side effects. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of EEN in terms of inducing clinical remission in newly diagnosed CD children and to study the efficacy of this therapeutic approach in improving the degree of intestinal mucosa inflammation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease treated with EEN were reviewed retrospectively. The degree of mucosal inflammation was assessed by fecal calprotectin (FC). Remission was defined as a PCDAI<10. RESULTS: Forty patients (24 males) were included, the age at diagnosis was 11.6 +/- 3.6 years. Of the 34 patients who completed the EEN period, 32 (94% per-protocol analysis) achieved clinical remission. This percentage fell to 80% in the intention-to-treat analysis. The compliance rate was 95%. Duration of EEN was 6.42 weeks (IQR 6.0-8.14). FC was significantly higher in patients with moderate and severe disease. Median baseline FC levels (680 mug/g) decreased significantly to 218 mug/g (P<0.0001) after EEN. We found a statistically significant correlation between FC and PCDAI (rho=0.727; P<0.0001). Early use of thiopurines (< 8 weeks) versus subsequent use was not associated with improved outcomes during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: EEN administered for 6-8 weeks is effective for inducing clinical remission and decreasing the degree of mucosal inflammation. We did not find differences in terms of maintenance of remission in patients treated early with thiopurines.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is a polygenic immune-mediated disease characterized by gastrointestinal inflammation. Mice deficient in the hematopoietic-restricted SH2 domain-containing inositolpolyphosphate 5'-phosphatase (SHIP) develop spontaneous CD-like ileal inflammation. Intriguingly, SHIP mRNA is not upregulated in biopsies from patients with ileal CD despite immune cell infiltration, but SHIP's role in human CD remains unknown. We analyzed SHIP mRNA expression and activity in biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from control and treatment-naive subjects with ileal CD, and demonstrated that SHIP mRNA and activity were lower in hematopoietic cells in ileal biopsies and PBMCs from subjects with CD. In all tissues from our patient cohort and in PBMCs from a second healthy control cohort, subjects homozygous for the autophagy-related 16-like protein (ATG16L1) CD-associated gene variant (rs2241880), had low SHIP mRNA expression and activity. SHIP protein expression increased during autophagy and SHIP upregulation was dependent on ATG16L1 and/or autophagy, as well as the ATG16L1 CD-associated gene variant. Finally, homozygosity for the ATG16L1 risk variant and low SHIP mRNA expression is inversely related to increased (LPS+ATP)-induced IL-1beta production by PBMCs in our cohorts and was regulated by increased transcription of ILIB. These data suggest a novel mechanism by which the ATG16L1 CD-associated gene variant may predispose people to develop intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Many patients with Crohn's disease on infliximab maintenance therapy have recurrent symptoms despite an initial clinical response. Therefore, concomitant therapies have been studied. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effect of specialized enteral nutrition therapy with infliximab versus infliximab monotherapy in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: A comprehensive search of multiple databases was performed. All studies of adult patients with Crohn's disease comparing specialized enteral nutrition therapy (elemental or polymeric diet with low-fat or regular diet) with infliximab versus infliximab monotherapy without dietary restrictions were included. Meta-analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel (fixed effect) model with odds ratio (OR) to assess for clinical remission. RESULTS: Four studies (n = 342) met inclusion criteria. Specialized enteral nutrition therapy with infliximab resulted in 109 of 157 (69.4%) patients reaching clinical remission compared with 84 of 185 (45.4%) with infliximab monotherapy [OR 2.73; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.73-4.31, p < 0.01]. Similarly, 79 of 106 (74.5%) patients receiving enteral nutrition therapy and infliximab remained in clinical remission after one year compared with 62 of 126 (49.2%) patients receiving infliximab monotherapy (OR 2.93; 95% CI: 1.66-5.17, p < 0.01). No publication bias or heterogeneity was noted for either outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The use of specialized enteral nutrition therapy in combination with infliximab appears to be more effective at inducing and maintaining clinical remission among patients with Crohn's disease than infliximab monotherapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are susceptible to protein-calorie malnutrition secondary to decreased oral intake, malabsorption, and increased metabolic expenditure. In this study, we seek to assess the national frequencies of parenteral nutrition (PN) use among hospitalized patients with IBD and to determine their in-hospital outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1988-2006 to determine the frequency of PN usage among patients with UC or CD and to determine their in-hospital outcomes. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of increased inpatient mortality in this population. RESULTS: From 1988-2006, the annual incidence of PN use among hospitalized patients with CD was 4.29 per 100,000 and among those with UC was 3.80 per 100,000, with trends being relatively stable through the indexed period. The mean length of hospitalization among patients with UC receiving PN was longer compared with patients with CD. Factors predictive of an increased risk for mortality include the following: age >50 years, acute kidney injury, hospital-acquired pneumonia, Clostridium difficile colitis, prolonged postoperative ileus requiring PN use, pulmonary embolism, malnutrition, and patients with UC relative to CD. CONCLUSION: Traditionally, patients with CD are at a higher risk for developing malnutrition than patients with UC; however, there is a 2-fold higher risk for inpatient mortality and a longer length of hospitalization among patients with UC compared with those with CD. This pattern suggests that the use of PN, particularly among patients with UC, serves as a surrogate marker of higher disease acuity and severity.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex, multi-factorial disease thought to arise from an inappropriate immune response to commensal bacteria in a genetically susceptible person that results in chronic, cyclical, intestinal inflammation. Dietary and environmental factors are implicated in the initiation and perpetuation of IBD; however, a singular causative agent has not been identified. As of now, the role of environmental priming or triggers in IBD onset and pathogenesis are not well understood, but these factors appear to synergize with other disease susceptibility factors. In previous work, we determined that the polysaccharide dietary additive, maltodextrin (MDX), impairs cellular anti-bacterial responses and suppresses intestinal anti-microbial defense mechanisms. In this addendum, we review potential mechanisms for dietary deregulation of intestinal homeostasis, postulate how dietary and genetic risk factors may combine to result in disease pathogenesis, and discuss these ideas in the context of recent findings related to dietary interventions for IBD.},

   abstract = {Genome-wide association studies in Crohn's disease (CD) have identified 140 genome-wide significant loci. However, identification of genes driving association signals remains challenging. Furthermore, genome-wide significant thresholds limit false positives at the expense of decreased sensitivity. In this study, we explored gene features contributing to CD pathogenicity, including gene-based association data from CD and autoimmune (AI) diseases, as well as gene expression features (eQTLs, epigenetic markers of expression and intestinal gene expression data). We developed an integrative model based on a CD reference gene set. This integrative approach outperformed gene-based association signals alone in identifying CD-related genes based on statistical validation, gene ontology enrichment, differential expression between M1 and M2 macrophages and a validation using genes causing monogenic forms of inflammatory bowel disease as a reference. Besides gene-level CD association P-values, association with AI diseases was the strongest predictor, highlighting generalized mechanisms of inflammation, and the interferon-gamma pathway particularly. Within the 140 high-confidence CD regions, 598 of 1328 genes had low prioritization scores, highlighting genes unlikely to contribute to CD pathogenesis. For select regions, comparably high integrative model scores were observed for multiple genes. This is particularly evident for regions having extensive linkage disequilibrium such as the IBD5 locus. Our analyses provide a standardized reference for prioritizing potential CD-related genes, in regions with both highly significant and nominally significant gene-level association P-values. Our integrative model may be particularly valuable in prioritizing rare, potentially private, missense variants for which genome-wide evidence for association may be unattainable.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the probability, rate and timing of reconstructive surgery after colectomy in patients with IBD in a population-based setting. METHOD: The study cohort included all patients with IBD in Sweden who underwent colectomy from 2000 to 2009. Each patient was followed from admission for colectomy to admission for reconstructive surgery, date of death, migration or 31 December 2010. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable Poisson regression models were used to describe the probability, rate and timing of reconstructive surgery. RESULTS: Out of 2818 IBD patients treated with colectomy, 61.0% were male and 78.9% had ulcerative colitis. No reconstructive surgery had been performed in 1595 (56.6%) patients by the end of follow-up. Of the remaining 1223 patients, 526 underwent primary reconstructive surgery and 697 had a secondary reconstruction following a median interval of 357 days from primary surgery in the form of colectomy. The probability of reconstructive surgery was dependent on age (55.6% and 18.1% at ages 15-29 and >/= 59 years, respectively), and the chance of reconstructive surgery was higher in hospitals that performed more than 13 colectomies for IBD per year [incidence rate ratio and 95% confidence interval 1.27 (1.09-1.49)]. CONCLUSION: Fewer than half of the patients having a colectomy for IBD underwent subsequent reconstructive surgery. Older age and low hospital volume were risk factors for no reconstructive surgery.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies describing the cumulative failure rate after reconstructive surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease have been restricted to specific hospitals, and the generalizability of these results in a population-based setting is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the cumulative failure rate and risk factors for failure after reconstructive surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The study cohort includes all patients with inflammatory bowel disease in Sweden who underwent colectomy in 2000 through 2013 who were later treated with reconstructive surgery with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis or ileorectal anastomosis. Each patient was followed from admission for reconstructive surgery until admission for failure (a diverting stoma or permanent stoma), date of death, migration or December 31, 2013. Cumulative failure distributions were obtained with the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariable Cox regression models were used to calculate the risk of failure. RESULTS: Of the 1809 patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with colectomy and reconstructive surgery, 83% had ulcerative colitis. During follow-up, 270 patients failed, and the cumulative failure rate was 4.1%, 13.2%, and 15.3% after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The risk of failure was lower after treatment with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis than with ileorectal anastomosis [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.72 (0.56-0.93)]. Gender, hospital volume, and timing of reconstruction were not significantly associated with the risk of failure. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-year cumulative failure rate in a nationwide setting was 15.3%, and hospital volume was not associated with the risk of failure.},

   abstract = {Decreases in the diversity of enteric bacterial populations are observed in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Less is known about the virome in these diseases. We show that the enteric virome is abnormal in CD and UC patients. In-depth analysis of preparations enriched for free virions in the intestine revealed that CD and UC were associated with a significant expansion of Caudovirales bacteriophages. The viromes of CD and UC patients were disease and cohort specific. Importantly, it did not appear that expansion and diversification of the enteric virome was secondary to changes in bacterial populations. These data support a model in which changes in the virome may contribute to intestinal inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis. We conclude that the virome is a candidate for contributing to, or being a biomarker for, human inflammatory bowel disease and speculate that the enteric virome may play a role in other diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fatigue is commonly reported by patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), both in quiescent and active disease. Few fatigue scales have been tested in IBD. AIM: To assess three fatigue assessment scales in IBD and to determine correlates of fatigue. METHODS: Potential participants (n = 2131) were randomly selected from an IBD organisation's members' database; 605 volunteered and were posted three fatigue scales: Inflammatory Bowel Disease Fatigue scale, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory and Multidimensional Assessment Fatigue scale and questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, quality of life (QoL) and IBD activity. The questionnaires were tested for stability over time with another group (n = 70) of invited participants. Internal consistency was measured by Cronbach's alpha and test-retest reliability by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-five of 605 (77%) questionnaires were returned; of 70 invited, 48/70 returned test (68.6%) and 41/70 (58.6%) returned retest. The three scales are highly correlated (P < 0.001). Test-retest suggests reasonable agreement with ICC values between 0.65 and 0.84. Lower age, female gender, IBD diagnosis, anxiety, depression and QoL were associated with fatigue (P < 0.001) on univariable analysis. However, on multivariable analysis only depression and low QoL were consistently associated with fatigue, while female gender was associated on most scales. IBD diagnosis, age and other factors were not consistently associated with severity or impact of fatigue once other variables were controlled for. CONCLUSIONS: All three fatigue scales are likely to measure IBD fatigue adequately. Responsiveness to change has not been tested. Depression, poorer QoL and probably female gender are the major associations of fatigue in IBD.},

   abstract = {Despite recent therapeutic advances, patients with Crohn's disease (CD) continue to experience high recurrence with cumulative structural damage and ultimate loss of nutritional autonomy. With short bowel syndrome, strictures, and enteric fistulae being the underlying pathology, CD is the second common indication for home parenteral nutrition (HPN). With development of intestinal failure, nutritional management including HPN is required as a rescue therapy. Unfortunately, some patients do not escape the HPN-associated complications. Therefore, the concept of gut rehabilitation has evolved as part of the algorithmic management of these patients, with transplantation being the ultimate life-saving therapy. With type 2 intestinal failure, comprehensive rehabilitative measures including nutritional care, pharmacologic manipulation, autologous reconstruction, and bowel lengthening is often successful, particularly in patients with quiescent disease. With type 3 intestinal failure, transplantation is the only life-saving treatment for patients with HPN failure and intractable disease. With CD being the second common indication for transplantation in adults, survival outcome continues to improve because of surgical innovation, novel immunosuppression, and better postoperative care. Despite being a rescue therapy, the procedure has achieved survival rates similar to other solid organs, and comparable to those who continue to receive HPN therapy. With similar technical, immunologic, and infectious complications, survival is similar in the CD and non-CD recipients. Full nutritional autonomy is achievable in most survivors with better quality of life and long-term cost-effectiveness. CD recurrence is rare with no impact on graft function. Further progress is anticipated with new insights into the pathogenesis of CD and mechanisms of transplant tolerance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare inherited disorder in which phagocytes are unable to eradicate pathogens because of a deficit of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase. Among CGD patients, approximately 30% to 50% develop severe gastrointestinal tract symptoms. Although characteristic histologic findings of CGD-associated colitis have been reported, information on endoscopic features remained vague. METHODS: A total of 8 male patients with CGD (ages 2-23 years) from 2 Japanese institutions underwent colonoscopy for the evaluation of their fever, diarrhea, bloody stool, and abdominal pain. The endoscopic and histologic findings were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The endoscopic findings of CGD-associated colitis appeared varied. Notably, brownish dots over a yellowish edematous mucosa were observed in 3 of the 8 patients. Prominent pigment-laden macrophages were noted histologically on the mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Although nonspecific endoscopic findings of CGD-associated colitis have been reported before, our observation of brownish dots spread across a yellowish edematous mucosa, termed "leopard sign," could be a unique feature of this condition.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite dietary factors being implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), nutritional therapy, outside of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN), has not had a defined role within the treatment paradigm of pediatric IBD within IBD centers. Based on emerging data, Seattle Children's Hospital IBD Center has developed an integrated dietary program incorporating the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) into its treatment paradigm. This treatment paradigm uses the SCD as primary therapy as well as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of the SCD on clinical outcomes and laboratory studies of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed the medical records of patients with IBD on SCD. RESULTS: We analyzed 26 children on the SCD: 20 with CD and 6 with UC. Duration of the dietary therapy ranged from 3 to 48 mo. In patients with active CD (Pediatric Crohn's Disease activity index [PCDAI] >10), PCDAI dropped from 32.8 +/- 13.2 at baseline to 20.8 +/- 16.6 by 4 +/- 2 wk, and to 8.8 +/- 8.5 by 6 mo. The mean Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for patients with active UC decreased from a baseline of 28.3 +/- 10.3 to 20.0 +/- 17.3 at 4 +/- 2 wk, to 18.3 +/- 31.7 at 6 mo. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review provides evidence that the SCD can be integrated into a tertiary care center and may improve clinical and laboratory parameters for pediatric patients with nonstructuring, nonpenetrating CD as well as UC. Further prospective studies are needed to fully assess the safety and efficacy of the SCD in pediatric patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {There is a close relationship between the human host and the intestinal microbiota, which is an assortment of microorganisms, protecting the intestine against colonization by exogenous pathogens. Moreover, the intestinal microbiota play a critical role in providing nutrition and the modulation of host immune homeostasis. Recent reports indicate that some strains of intestinal bacteria are responsible for intestinal ulceration and chronic inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Understanding the interaction of the intestinal microbiota with pathogens and the human host might provide new strategies treating patients with IBD. This review focuses on the important role that the intestinal microbiota plays in maintaining innate immunity in the pathogenesis and etiology of UC and discusses new antibiotic therapies targeting the intestinal microbiota.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The clinical presentation of colonic juvenile polyps with abdominal discomfort and occult rectal bleedings make them difficult to recognize. The aim of this study was to report the clinical features of colonic juvenile polyps in children referred to colonoscopy and evaluate fecal calprotectin (FCP) as a screening biomarker for their diagnosis. METHODS: The study included a total of 266 children (range 3.1-19.0 years, median age 15.8 years) investigated with ileocolonoscopy; of whom, 239 (89%) were investigated for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). FCPs were analyzed as a marker of colonic inflammation, and levels < 50 mg/kg was considered to be negative. RESULTS: Juvenile polyps were detected in 12 (4.5%) children; the remaining 67 (25.2%) had Crohn disease, 57 (21.4%) ulcerative colitis, 5 (1.9%) unclassified IBD, 4 (1.5%) allergic colitis, bleeding source was localized in 6 (2.3%), and 115 (43.2%) had unspecific or normal findings. FCP was available in 203 (76.3%) children before colonoscopy; levels of FCP were higher in children with juvenile polyps (range 28-2287 mg/kg, median 844 mg/kg) compared with those with normal colonoscopies (range < 20-2443 mg/kg, median 130 mg/kg, P < 0.0001), but not compared with those with active IBD (range < 20-7780 mg/kg, median 962 mg/kg, P = 0.6299). FCPs were available in 9 of 12 children after polypectomy, of whom all had their FCP levels significantly reduced (range 0-281 mg/kg, median 49 mg/kg, P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Colonic juvenile polyps are frequently found in pediatric patients presenting with hematochezia and elevated FCP levels. Colonic juvenile polyps are difficult to differentiate from pediatric IBD without a colonoscopy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presentation, therapeutic management, and long-term outcome of children with very early-onset (VEO) (</= 5 years of age) inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). STUDY DESIGN: Data were obtained from an inception cohort of 1928 children with IBD enrolled in a prospective observational registry at multiple centers in North America. RESULTS: One hundred twelve children were </= 5 years of age with no child enrolled at <1 year of age. Of those, 42.9% had Crohn's disease (CD), 46.4% ulcerative colitis (UC), and 10.7% had IBD-unclassified. Among the children with CD, children 1-5 years of age had more isolated colonic disease (39.6%) compared with 6- to 10-year-olds (25.3%, P = .04), and 11- to 16-year-olds (22.3%, P < .01). The change from a presenting colon-only phenotype to ileocolonic began at 6-10 years. Children 1-5 years of age with CD had milder disease activity (45.8%) at diagnosis compared with the oldest group (28%, P = .01). Five years postdiagnosis, there was no difference in disease activity among the 3 groups. However, compared with the oldest group, a greater proportion of 1- to 5-year-olds with CD were receiving corticosteroids (P < .01) and methotrexate (P < .01), and a greater proportion of 1- to 5-year-olds with UC were receiving mesalamine (P < .0001) and thiopurine immunomodulators (P < .0002). CONCLUSIONS: Children with VEO-CD are more likely to have mild disease at diagnosis and present with a colonic phenotype with change to an ileocolonic phenotype noted at 6-10 years of age. Five years after diagnosis, children with VEO-CD and VEO-UC are more likely to have been administered corticosteroids and immunomodulators despite similar disease activity in all age groups. This may suggest development of a more aggressive disease phenotype over time.},

He was then treated with high-dose cytarabine and achieved CR. Molecular relapse was detected during post-remission therapy and he underwent myeloablative bone marrow transplantation from his HLA-matched sibling donor. One year after transplantation, he developed an intractable anal fistula during treatment of chronic GVHD. Colonoscopy showed longitudinal ulcers and cobblestone appearance, and histopathological examination revealed non-caseating epithelioid granuloma. According to these findings, he was diagnosed with Crohn's-like chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. He was treated with enteral nutrition, mesalazine and dose re-escalation of cyclosporine, but these therapies were not effective. Therefore, we decided to treat him with infliximab. After starting treatment with infliximab, his abdominal symptoms and the anal fistula showed prompt improvement. There are few reports regarding the efficacy of infliximab for gastrointestinal chronic GVHD. Our experience suggests that infliximab could be useful for the treatment of Crohn's-like gastrointestinal inflammatory disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Industrialization has been linked to the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). AIM: We investigated the association between air pollution exposure and IBD. METHODS: The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort was used to identify cases with Crohn's disease (CD) (n = 38) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 104) and controls (n = 568) from Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and the UK, matched for center, gender, age, and date of recruitment. Air pollution data were obtained from the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects. Residential exposure was assessed with land-use regression models for particulate matter with diameters of <10 mum (PM10), <2.5 mum (PM2.5), and between 2.5 and 10 mum (PMcoarse), soot (PM2.5 absorbance), nitrogen oxides, and two traffic indicators. Conditional logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Although air pollution was not significantly associated with CD or UC separately, the associations were mostly similar. Individuals with IBD were less likely to have higher exposure levels of PM2.5 and PM10, with ORs of 0.24 (95 % CI 0.07-0.81) per 5 mug/m(3) and 0.25 (95 % CI 0.08-0.78) per 10 mug/m(3), respectively. There was an inverse but nonsignificant association for PMcoarse. A higher nearby traffic load was positively associated with IBD [OR 1.60 (95 % CI 1.04-2.46) per 4,000,000 motor vehicles x m per day]. Other air pollutants were positively but not significantly associated with IBD. CONCLUSION: Exposure to air pollution was not found to be consistently associated with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dairy products may be involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease by modulating gut microbiota and immune responses, but data from epidemiological studies examining this relationship are limited. We investigated the association between prediagnostic intake of these foods and dietary calcium, and the subsequent development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In total, 401,326 participants were enrolled in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. At recruitment, consumption of total and specific dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and dietary calcium was measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. Cases developing incident CD (n = 110) or UC (n = 244) during follow-up were matched with 4 controls. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for total energy intake and smoking. RESULTS: Compared with the lowest quartile, the ORs for the highest quartile of total dairy products and dietary calcium intake were 0.61 (95% CI, 0.32-1.19, p trend = 0.19) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.28-1.42, p trend = 0.23) for CD, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.50-1.30, p trend = 0.40) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.49-1.34, p trend = 0.60) for UC, respectively. Compared with nonconsumers, individuals consuming milk had significantly reduced odds of CD (OR 0.30, 95% CI, 0.13-0.65) and nonsignificantly reduced odds of UC (OR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.49-1.47). CONCLUSIONS: Milk consumption may be associated with a decreased risk of developing CD, although a clear dose-response relationship was not established. Further studies are warranted to confirm this possible protective effect.},

We investigated how intracellular calcium kinetics of Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes alter upon specific inhibition of Kv1.3 and IKCa1 channels in pediatric Crohn's disease. STUDY DESIGN: Blood was taken from 12 healthy and 29 Crohn's disease children. Of those, 6 were switched to infliximab and re-sampled after the 4th infliximab treatment. Intracellular calcium levels were monitored using flow cytometry in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors of Kv1.3 and IKCa1 potassium channels. RESULTS: In Crohn's disease treated with standard therapy, calcium response during activation was higher than normal in Th2 cells. This was normalized in vitro by inhibition of Kv1.3 or IKCa1 potassium channels. After the switch to infliximab, potassium channel function and expression in Th2 lymphocytes were comparable to those in Th1 cells. CONCLUSION: These results may indicate that potassium channels are potential immune modulatory targets in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Surgery for IBD is in constant evolution; it does not appear that the introduction of biologicals has had a major effect on the chance of a patient being operated on or not. Pouch surgery had its heydays in the 80s and 90s and has since then become less frequent, but the number of patients undergoing surgery still seem about the same from one year to the other. Likewise, there is no substantial evidence that surgery for Crohn's disease is diminishing. There have been fears that patients on biological treatment have an increased risk of postoperative complications. The issue is not completely settled but it is likely that patients on biological treatment who come to surgery are those who do not benefit from biologicals. Thus, they are compromised in that they have an ongoing inflammation, are in bad nutritional state, and might have several other known risk factors for a complicated postoperative course. These factors and perhaps not the biologicals per se is what surgeons should consider. During the recent years, we have seen several new developments in IBD surgery; the ileorectal anastomosis is being used for ulcerative colitis and laparoscopic surgery usually resulting in a shorter hospital stay, less pain, and better cosmetics. We have also seen the introduction of robotic surgery, single incision minimal invasive surgery, transanal minimal invasive surgery, and other approaches to minimize surgical trauma. Time will show which of these innovations patients will benefit from.},

   abstract = {Most inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are classic complex disorders represented by common alleles. Here we aimed to define the genetic architecture of pediatric and adult-onset IBDs for the Polish population. A total of 1495 patients were recruited, including 761 patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 424 pediatric), 734 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; 390 pediatric), and 934 healthy controls. Allelotyping employed a pooled-DNA genome-wide association study (GWAS) and was validated by individual genotyping. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 44 IBD patients diagnosed before 6 years of age, 45 patients diagnosed after 40 years of age, and 18 healthy controls. Altogether, out of 88 selected SNPs, 31 SNPs were replicated for association with IBD. A novel BRD2 (rs1049526) association reached significance of P = 5.2 x 10-11 and odds ratio (OR) = 2.43. Twenty SNPs were shared between pediatric and adult patients; 1 and 7 were unique to adult-onset and pediatric-onset IBD, respectively. WES identified numerous rare and potentially deleterious variants in IBD-associated or innate immunity-associated genes. Deleterious alleles in both groups were over-represented among rare variants in affected children. Our GWAS revealed differences in the polygenic architecture of pediatric- and adult-onset IBD. A significant accumulation of rare and deleterious variants in affected children suggests a contribution by yet unexplained genetic components.},

   abstract = {There is increasing scientific interest in the field of vitamin D research, moving the focus beyond bone health to other disease processes. Low circulating vitamin D levels have been reported as a risk factor for several pathophysiologically divergent diseases, including cancers, diabetes, CVD, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But, therein, remains the challenge: can any single nutrient contribute to multiple complex disease mechanisms and, ultimately, have therapeutic potential? The aim of this review is to critically evaluate several strands of scientific evidence surrounding vitamin D and inflammation, primarily focusing on IBD. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased incidence of IBD and rheumatoid arthritis in countries of more northern latitudes, mirroring sunlight patterns. A considerable body of evidence supports the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, at least in animal models of IBD. Although it is accepted that suboptimal vitamin D status is common in IBD, some studies suggest that this associates with more severe disease. With regard to treatment, the data are only beginning to emerge from randomised controlled trials to suggest that people with IBD may remain in remission longer when treated with oral vitamin D. In conclusion, several strands of evidence suggest that vitamin D may modify the immune response in IBD. There is a continued need for large well-designed clinical trials and mechanistic studies to determine if, and how, this emerging promise translates into tangible clinical benefits for people with chronic debilitating diseases such as IBD.},

In recent years, it was shown that T helper 17 (Th17) cells are involved in the pathogenesis of IBD, which makes them an attractive therapeutic target. Th17 cells preferentially produce interleukin (IL)-17A-F as signature cytokines. The role of the interplay between host genetics and intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD was demonstrated. Probiotics are live microorganisms that when orally ingested in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host by modulating the enteric flora or by stimulating the local immune system. Several studies indicated the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing and treating IBD (ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease). Furthermore, there is mounting evidence of probiotics selectively targeting the Th17 lineage in the prevention and management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as IBD. This review highlights critical roles of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of IBD and the rationale for using probiotics as a novel therapeutic approach for IBD through manipulation of Th17 cells. The potential molecular mechanisms by which probiotics modulate Th17 cells differentiation and production are also discussed.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development is affected by complex interactions between environmental factors, changes in intestinal flora, various predisposing genetic properties and changes in the immune system. Dietary factors seem to play an underestimated role in the etiopathogenesis and course of the disease. However, research about food and IBD is conflicting. An excessive consumption of sugar, animal fat and linoleic acid is considered a risk factor for IBD development, whereas a high fiber diet and citrus fruit consumption may play a protective role. Also, appropriate nutrition in particular periods of the disease may facilitate achieving or prolonging remissions and most of all, improve the quality of life for patients. During disease exacerbation, a low fiber diet is recommended for most patients. In the remission time, an excessive consumption of alcohol and sulfur products may have a negative effect on the disease course. Attempts are also made at employing diets composed in detail in order to supplement IBD therapy. A diet with a modified carbohydrate composition, a semi-vegetarian diet and a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols are under investigation. Due to chronic inflammation as well as side effects of chronically used medications, patients with IBD are also at increased risk of nutritional factor deficiencies, including iron, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, folic acid, zinc, magnesium and vitamin A. It should also be remembered that there is no single common diet suitable for all IBD patients; each of them is unique and dietary recommendations must be individually developed for each patient, depending on the course of the disease, past surgical procedures and type of pharmacotherapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The literature on interaction between pregnancy and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is inconsistent, and there are no reports on this aspect from Asia. This study evaluated the impact both IBD and pregnancy have on each other in a large cohort of Indian patients. METHODS: In total, 514 females with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) aged between 18 and 45 years attending IBD clinic, at our institute, from July 2004 to July 2013 were screened, and patients with data on pregnancy status were included (n = 406). Pregnancies were categorized as either before, after or coinciding with disease onset. Long-term disease course was ascertained from prospectively maintained records. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes were recorded from antenatal records or individual interviews. RESULTS: Of 406 patients (UC: 336, CD: 70), 310 became pregnant (UC: 256, CD: 54), with a total of 597 pregnancies (UC: 524, CD: 73). More UC patients with pregnancies were in long-term remission than non-pregnant patients (56.7 vs. 43.4 %, p = 0.04). Long-term remission was less frequent in UC patients in whom pregnancy coincided with disease onset than patients with pregnancies before and after/pregnancy after the disease onset (41.4 vs. 62.5 %, p = 0.023). Pregnancies after the disease onset were associated with more cesarean sections and adverse fetal outcomes than pregnancies before disease onset in both UC and CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term disease course in UC patients was better in pregnant as compared to non-pregnant patients. Among pregnant UC patients, disease course was worst when pregnancy coincided with disease onset. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes were worse in pregnancy after disease onset than pregnancy before disease onset.},

IBD can be generally classified into either ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) that differs in the clinical and histopathology. The role of neuropeptides in the pathogenesis of these conditions is becoming increasingly recognized for their importance in modulating the inflammatory state. Animal models provide the greatest insight to better understand the pathophysiology of both disorders which will hopefully allow for improved treatment strategies. This review will provide a better understanding of the role of murine models for studying colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study assessed the efficacy and safety of briakinumab, a human anti-IL-12/23p40 monoclonal antibody, compared with placebo for the induction and maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. METHODS: In this phase 2b, multicenter, double-blind, parallel group study, 246 patients stratified by prior tumor necrosis factor-antagonist use and response, were randomized (1:1:1:3) to 4 intravenous induction regimens: placebo, 200, 400, or 700 mg briakinumab, at weeks 0/4/8. At week 12, responders in the placebo or 400-mg induction groups entered the maintenance phase with the same regimen, whereas responders in the 700-mg induction group were rerandomized (1:1:1) to receive placebo, 200, or 700 mg briakinumab at weeks 12/16/20. At week 24, patients in remission stopped receiving study drug (withdrawal phase) until relapse. Patients experiencing relapse, nonresponders, and nonremitters could enter the open-label phase. RESULTS: The primary end point of clinical remission at week 6 was not met. There were numerically greater rates of remission and response at 6, 12, or 24 weeks in patients treated with briakinumab. The safety and tolerability profile of briakinumab was similar in the induction and maintenance phases of the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Briakinumab showed a similar safety and tolerability profile to placebo in the induction and maintenance phases, and comparable rates of serious adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation, and malignancy. These data provide support for the potential efficacy of briakinumab and other IL-12/23 inhibitors in the treatment of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is increasing in incidence and prevalence in Asia, but there is a paucity of population-based studies on risk factors for surgery in Asian patients with CD. This will be useful to identify patients who may benefit from top-down treatment. This study describes the rates of abdominal surgery and identifies associated risk factors in Singaporean patients with CD. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study. The medical records of Singaporeans diagnosed with CD from 1970 to 2013 were reviewed from 8 different hospitals in Singapore. The cumulative probability of CD-related abdominal surgery was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The logistic regression model was used to assess associations between independent risk factors and surgery. RESULTS: The cohort of 430 Singaporean patients with CD included 63.5% Chinese, 11.9% Malay, and 24.7% Indians, with a male to female ratio of 1.6; median follow-up was 7.3 years (range, 2.9-13.0 yr) and median age at diagnosis 30.5 years (range, 19.5-43.7 yr). One hundred twelve patients (26.0%) required major abdominal surgery: the cumulative risk of surgery was 14.9% at 90 days, 21.2% at 5 years, 28.8% at 10 years, 38.3% at 20 years, and 50.6% at 30 years from diagnosis. Of the surgical patients, 75.0% were Chinese, 10.7% Malays, and 14.3% Indians; 21.4% underwent surgery for inflammatory disease, 40.2% for stricturing disease, and 38.4% for penetrating disease. Age at diagnosis (A2 17-40 yr, OR: 2.75, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-7.76), ileal disease (L1 location, OR: 2.35, 95% CI, 1.14-5.0), stricturing (B2 OR: 6.09, 95% CI, 3.20-11.8), and penetrating behavior (B3 OR: 21.6, 95% CI, 9.0-58.8) were independent risk factors for CD-related abdominal surgery. Indian patients were less likely to require surgery (OR: 0.40, 95% CI, 0.19-0.78). CONCLUSIONS: Age at diagnosis, L1 location, B2, and B3 disease behavior are independent risk factors for abdominal surgery. Interestingly, despite a higher prevalence of CD in Indians, a smaller proportion of Indian patients required surgery. These findings suggest that both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the risk of surgery in Asian patients with CD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) encompass at least two forms of intestinal inflammation: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). Both conditions are chronic and inflammatory disorders in the gastrointestinal tract, with an increasing prevalence being associated with the industrialization of nations and in developing countries. Patients with these disorders are 10 to 20 times more likely to develop cancer of the colon. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of a naturally occurring polyphenol, gallic acid (GA), in an experimental murine model of UC. A significant blunting of weight loss and clinical symptoms was observed in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-exposed, GA-treated mice compared with control mice. This effect was associated with a remarkable amelioration of the disruption of the colonic architecture, a significant reduction in colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and a decrease in the expression of inflammatory mediators, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, GA reduced the activation and nuclear accumulation of p-STAT3(Y705), preventing the degradation of the inhibitory protein IkappaB and inhibiting of the nuclear translocation of p65-NF-kappaB in colonic mucosa. These findings suggest that GA exerts potentially clinically useful anti-inflammatory effects mediated through the suppression of p65-NF-kappaB and IL-6/p-STAT3(Y705) activation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is a need for a scoring system that provides a comprehensive assessment of structural bowel damage, including stricturing lesions, penetrating lesions, and surgical resection, for measuring disease progression. We developed the Lemann Index and assessed its ability to measure cumulative structural bowel damage in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter, international, cross-sectional study of patients with CD evaluated at 24 centers in 15 countries. Inclusions were stratified based on CD location and duration. All patients underwent clinical examination and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging analyses. Upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging analyses were performed according to suspected disease locations. The digestive tract was divided into 4 organs and subsequently into segments. For each segment, investigators collected information on previous operations, predefined strictures, and/or penetrating lesions of maximal severity (grades 1-3), and then provided damage evaluations ranging from 0.0 (no lesion) to 10.0 (complete resection). Overall level of organ damage was calculated from the average of segmental damage. Investigators provided a global damage evaluation (from 0.0 to 10.0) using calculated organ damage evaluations. Predicted organ indexes and Lemann Index were constructed using a multiple linear mixed model, showing the best fit with investigator organ and global damage evaluations, respectively. An internal cross-validation was performed using bootstrap methods. RESULTS: Data from 138 patients (24, 115, 92, and 59 with upper tract, small bowel, colon/rectum, and anus CD location, respectively) were analyzed. According to validation, the unbiased correlation coefficients between predicted indexes and investigator damage evaluations were 0.85, 0.98, 0.90, 0.82 for upper tract, small bowel, colon/rectum, anus, respectively, and 0.84 overall. CONCLUSIONS: In a cross-sectional study, we assessed the ability of the Lemann Index to measure cumulative structural bowel damage in patients with CD. Provided further successful validation and good sensitivity to change, the index should be used to evaluate progression of CD and efficacy of treatment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The cost of medical care for Crohn's disease (CD) and comorbidities in the era of biologics is unclear. We examined insurance claims data from US health plans to understand this relationship. METHODS: Longitudinal CD patient data and reimbursement information from 11 health plans engaged with Accordant Health Services between 2011 and 2013 were analyzed. The analysis considered data for all CD patients and for the patient subgroup </=20 years and >20 years of age. Descriptive statistics measured the mean health-plan paid costs per patient, the relative cost contribution of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, and health care costs for 31 specific comorbid conditions among CD patients. RESULTS: Overall, there were 5,090 CD patients (57% women) of which 587 CD patients were </=20 years of age. The mean health-plan paid cost per member per year was $18,637 (s.d. $32,023) for all CD patients, $22,796 (s.d. $ 41,905) for CD patients </=20 years, and $18,095 (s.d. $30,065) for patients >20 years of age. Twenty-eight percent of CD patients accounted for 80% of total costs. No differences were found in costs based on gender. Increased health-plan paid costs were significantly correlated with the number of comorbid conditions across all ages. Pharmacy utilization costs account for nearly one-half (45.5%) of the total CD-attributable costs, exceeding inpatient care costs. Anti-TNF agents alone comprised nearly one-third (29.5%) of total costs. Aside from anti-TNF costs, other major categories of expense were as follows: inpatient 23.1%, outpatient hospital setting 15.7%, and MD office 8.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Total health-care costs in CD exceed previous estimates, with the majority of costs being allocated to a relatively small subgroup of patients. Pharmacy utilization costs, owing to anti-TNF use, result in increasing total health-care costs and currently exceed costs for inpatient care. Pragmatic strategies to encourage gastroenterologists in the best clinical practice of optimizing anti-TNF use-in particular for younger age patients and those with multiple comorbidities-are necessary to reduce avoidable pharmacy utilization and inpatient care costs.},

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of small bowel imaging within 30 days of diagnosis of pediatric Crohn's disease was conducted. Patients were divide into two groups based on small bowel imaging: those with no or minor abnormalities (71%) and those with more extensive or obstructive abnormalities (29%). Medical records were reviewed for small bowel surgical intervention and clinic follow-up visits. RESULTS: 232 patients were included in the study group (average age at diagnosis 11.7 years). Twenty-seven patients (12%) underwent small bowel surgical intervention. The relative risk for small bowel surgical intervention was 2.91 in the group with more extensive imaging abnormalities. The majority of increased surgical risk occurred in the first year after diagnosis, when the normal-minor group had a 2% surgical risk and the more abnormal group had a 17% surgical risk. Both groups had a 2-3% surgical risk per year after the first year. CONCLUSIONS: Small bowel imaging at the time of diagnosis in pediatric Crohn's disease can help predict the risk of small bowel surgical intervention, and should be recommended for all newly diagnosed patients.

   abstract = {Polymorphisms in NOD2 represent the single greatest genetic risk factor for the development of Crohn's disease. Three different non-synonomous NOD2 polymorphisms - R702W, G908R, and L1007fsincC - account for roughly 80% of all NOD2-associated cases of Crohn's disease and are reported to result in a loss of receptor function in response to muramyl dipeptide (MDP) stimulation. Loss of NOD2 signaling can result from a failure to detect ligand; alterations in cellular localization; and changes in protein interactions, such as an inability to interact with the downstream adaptor protein RIPK2. Using an overexpression system, we analyzed ~50 NOD2 polymorphisms reportedly connected to Crohn's disease to determine if they also displayed loss of function and if this could be related to alterations in protein localization and/or association with RIPK2. Just under half the polymorphisms displayed a significant reduction in signaling capacity following ligand stimulation, with nine of them showing near complete ablation. Only two polymorphisms, R38M and R138Q, lost the ability to interact with RIPK2. However, both these polymorphisms still associated with cellular membranes. In contrast, L248R, W355stop, L550V, N825K, L1007fsinC, L1007P, and R1019stop still bound RIPK2, but showed impaired membrane association and were unable to signal in response to MDP. This highlights the complex contributions of NOD2 polymorphisms to Crohn's disease and reiterates the importance of both RIPK2 binding and membrane association in NOD2 signaling. Simply ascertaining whether or not NOD2 polymorphisms bind RIPK2 or associate with cellular membranes is not sufficient for determining their signaling competency.},

In this article, we review the evidence supporting preoperative optimization, discussing strategies that potentially improve surgical outcomes and reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality. We discuss the roles of adequate cross-sectional imaging, nutritional optimization, appropriate adjustments of medical therapy, management of preoperative abscesses and phlegmons, smoking cessation and thromboembolic prophylaxis. We also review operation-related factors, and discuss their potential implications with respect to postoperative complications. Overall, the literature suggests that preoperative management has a major effect on postoperative outcomes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We developed a new IgA and IgG anti-MZGP2 antibody ELISAs based on recombinant isoform-4 of human zymogen granule protein-2 (GP2), which is the major autoantigen of Crohn's disease (CrD)-specific pancreatic autoantibodies and assessed their clinical relevance in the largest inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort tested to date. METHODS: 832 sera were studied, including 617 consecutive IBD patients from 323 CrD and 294 ulcerative colitis (UC) follow-up in a tertiary centre, and 112 pathological and 103 normal controls. RESULTS: Sensitivity of IgA anti-MZGP2 for CrD in the IBD population was 15% and specificity was 98% (95, 99), while the sensitivity and specificity of IgG anti-MZGP2 were 27% and 97%. IgA and IgG anti-MZGP2 combined testing led to a sensitivity of 31% and a specificity of 96%. Positivity for either ASCA (IgA or IgG) or anti-MZGP2 (IgA or IgG) showed a sensitivity of 75% (70, 80) and a specificity of 84% (79, 89). IgA anti-MZGP2 antibodies were more prevalent in CrD patients with early disease onset (p=0.011). Also, anti-MZGP2 positive patients more frequently had extensive disease with ileal involvement. Patients with longer disease duration were more likely to have IgG anti-MZGP2 antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel ELISA confirms the high specificity of anti-MZGP2 antibodies for CrD and their association with disease severity phenotypes.},

   abstract = {Nutrition is involved in several aspects of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ranging from disease etiology to induction and maintenance of disease. With regards to etiology, there are pediatric data, mainly from case-control studies, which suggest that some dietary habits (for example consumption of animal protein, fatty foods, high sugar intake) may predispose patients to IBD onset. As for disease treatment, exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an extensively studied, well established, and valid approach to the remission of pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Apart from EEN, several new nutritional approaches are emerging and have proved to be successful (specific carbohydrate diet and CD exclusion diet) but the available evidence is not strong enough to recommend this kind of intervention in clinical practice and new large experimental controlled studies are needed, especially in the pediatric population. Moreover, efforts are being made to identify foods with anti-inflammatory properties such as curcumin and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3, which can possibly be effective in maintenance of disease. The present systematic review aims at reviewing the scientific literature on all aspects of nutrition in pediatric IBD, including the most recent advances on nutritional therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several transport alterations have been described in intestinal inflammatory diseases. This is relevant because the primary function of the intestine is nutrient and mineral absorption. However, analysis of the transportome as a whole and the effect of commensal bacteria on it have not been addressed so far. METHODS: Five healthy and 6 Crohn's disease (CD) samples were hybridized to human HT-12 V4 Illumina GeneChip. Results were validated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and with additional array data. Organ culture assays were performed from mucosa ileal wall specimens collected at surgery. Samples were incubated with or without commensal bacteria for 4 hours. Finally, RNA was isolated for microarray processing. RESULTS: The analysis of CD versus healthy ileal mucosa demonstrated upregulation of previously described genes involved in immunity and the inflammatory response in this disease. Interestingly, whole transcriptional analysis revealed profound alterations in the transportome profile. Sixty-two solute carrier (SLC) transporters displayed different expression patterns, most of them being downregulated. Changes were confirmed by RT-PCR in a randomly chosen subset of SLCs. A large number of amino acid transporters and most members of the enteric purinome were found to be altered. Most of these proteins were found at the apical membrane of the enterocyte, which could impair both amino acid absorption and purinergic signalling. Treatment of ileum specimen explants with commensal bacteria restored almost all CD transportome alterations. CONCLUSIONS: These results describe the altered transportome profile in CD and open the possibility of restoring transportome complications with commensal bacteria.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of multifactorial etiology that primarily affects the colonic mucosa. The disease progresses over time, and clinical management guidelines should reflect its dynamic nature. There is limited evidence supporting UC management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach. AIM: To use a formal consensus method - the nominal group technique (NGT) - to develop a clinical practice expert opinion to outline simple algorithms and practices, optimize UC management, and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions. METHODS: The consensus was developed by an expert panel of 37 gastroenterologists from various professional organizations with experience in UC management using the qualitative and iterative NGT, incorporating deliberations based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommendations, recent reviews of scientific literature, and pertinent discussion topics developed by a steering committee. Examples of clinical cases for which there are limited evidence-based data from clinical trials were used. Two working groups proposed and voted on treatment algorithms that were then discussed and voted for by the nominal group as a whole, in order to reach a consensus. RESULTS: A clinical practice guideline covering management of the following clinical situations was developed: (i) moderate and severe UC; (ii) acute severe UC; (iii) pouchitis; (iv) refractory proctitis, in the form of treatment algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: Given the limited available evidence-based data, a formal consensus methodology was used to develop simple treatment guidelines for UC management in different clinical situations that is now accessible via an online application.},

There is no curative medical treatment but current treatments provide increasingly sustainable control of the disease and allow patients a better quality of life. There is limited evidence supporting CD management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach. AIMS: To help clinicians in making informed treatment decisions, a group of 59 French gastroenterologists with experience in the management of CD met to develop straightforward and practical algorithms based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) recommendations. METHODS: This experts' opinion was developed following a Nominal Group consensus methodology. Nine clinical situations were identified: mildly active CD; uncomplicated moderately active CD, with, and without poor prognostic factors; uncomplicated severely active CD; perianal CD with a single fistula; perianal CD with complex fistula with or without abscess; complicated CD with abscess; intestinal stricture; and post-operative CD. Two working groups were formed and proposed algorithms that were then approved by a two-thirds majority of the Nominal Group. RESULTS: These algorithms represent the pragmatic consensus of a group of experts in gastroenterology on the modalities of therapeutic care in different clinical situations in CD.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] therapy in combination with thiopurine is the most effective strategy for Crohn's disease, but raises safety concerns. METHODS: In a retrospective multicentre study, we investigated long-term outcome of patients starting anti-TNF monotherapy for Crohn's disease and investigated whether introducing an immunomodulator in patients losing response to anti-TNF monotherapy is effective for resetting immunogenicity. RESULTS: A total of 350 adult patients with Crohn's disease received either infliximab [n = 178, 51%] or adalimumab [n = 172, 49%] monotherapy. Mean duration of follow-up was 42 months. An immunomodulator was initiated in 53 patients [15%]. At last follow-up, 73.1% [n = 38] were in clinical remission [one patient with missing data]. Multivariate analysis identified anti-TNF type [higher need for starting immunomodulator for infliximab than for adalimumab; p = 0.0058] and first- vs second-/third-/fourth-line anti-TNF therapy [p = 0.014] as predictors of immunomodulator initiation. Among the 18 patients with available data, introduction of an immunomodulator was able to restore infliximab trough level within the therapeutic range and to induce clinical remission in 10 patients [55%]. Cumulative probability of remaining on anti-TNF therapy was 57.9% at 5 years among the 297 patients not starting an immunomodulator during follow-up. CONCLUSION: An immunomodulator was initiated in 15% of patients with Crohn's disease starting anti-TNF monotherapy. Independent predictors of immunomodulator initiation were infliximab use and second-/third-/fourth-line anti-TNF therapy. Resetting immunogenicity with an immunomodulator was effective in half of patients in a sub-study. Persistence of anti-TNF treatment at 5 years was observed in half of the 297 patients not starting an immumodulator in a real-life setting.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE) program was initiated by the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IOIBD). It examined potential treatment targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to be used for a "treat-to-target" clinical management strategy using an evidence-based expert consensus process. METHODS: A Steering Committee of 28 IBD specialists developed recommendations based on a systematic literature review and expert opinion. Consensus was gained if >/=75% of participants scored the recommendation as 7-10 on a 10-point rating scale (where 10=agree completely). RESULTS: The group agreed upon 12 recommendations for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The agreed target for UC was clinical/patient-reported outcome (PRO) remission (defined as resolution of rectal bleeding and diarrhea/altered bowel habit) and endoscopic remission (defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0-1). Histological remission was considered as an adjunctive goal. Clinical/PRO remission was also agreed upon as a target for CD and defined as resolution of abdominal pain and diarrhea/altered bowel habit; and endoscopic remission, defined as resolution of ulceration at ileocolonoscopy, or resolution of findings of inflammation on cross-sectional imaging in patients who cannot be adequately assessed with ileocolonoscopy. Biomarker remission (normal C-reactive protein (CRP) and calprotectin) was considered as an adjunctive target. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence- and consensus-based recommendations for selecting the goals for treat-to-target strategies in patients with IBD are made available. Prospective studies are needed to determine how these targets will change disease course and patients' quality of life.},

   abstract = {AIM: To study whether adalimumab (ADA) was associated with improvement in growth, bone mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolism. METHODS: In children with Crohn's disease (CD) there is a high prevalence of growth failure and reduced BMD. Treatment with infliximab is associated with an improvement in growth. Anthropometry, paediatric CD activity index (PCDAI), bone markers and BMD was measured in 18 patients (72% females) one year before and after start of ADA with a median age of 14.4 years (range: 5-19 years) at treatment start. Outcomes were indicators of growth with treatment as well as interval growth. RESULTS: Eleven (61%) children experienced catch-up growth after ADA. PCDAI significantly decreased from 52.1 +/- 16 to 30.4 +/- 23 (P </= 0.001). Post ADA, body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS) 0.1[range: 2.7-(-0.8)] vs -1 [range: 0.1-(-3.6)], P = 0.04 and BMI SDS in children 0.3 [range: 0.7-(-0.2)] vs -1.1 [range: 1.2-(-2.3)], P = 0.01 in remission were significantly higher compared to those with moderate to severe inflammation. The main predictors for growth were 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and for bone mineralisation weight and height SDS. ADA had no significant influence on bone markers and BMD. CONCLUSION: Next to improvement of PCDAI, half of the children achieved a positive catch-up growth. A better nutritional status with improvement in BMI and weight is positive predictor for improved growth and bone mineralisation.},

   abstract = {The immune response is a very complex interplay of specific and nonspecific branches that have evolved to distinguish between nondangerous and dangerous or nontolerated factors. In the past, research has focused on the specific immune system much more than the host's innate defense. Studies have shown that a key component of the immune response involves activation of the inflammasome. A direct relationship between the presence of the inflammasome and the onset of disease has already been characterized for a variety of chronic and food-related diseases, including arthrosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, and chronic bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The leukocyte activation (ALCAT test), an immunological blood test for food intolerance reactions, is ideal to identify and eliminate individual food stimuli that may act as triggers for the cellular nonspecific immune response. Although the test is not diagnostic, studies have established that it can be a useful screening tool for the identification of foreign substances that may trigger immune cell activation, particularly of neutrophils, leading to inflammatory disorders. The ALCAT test, coupled with a targeted diet that is individually tailored according to the test's results, may support immune homeostasis and provide a valuable complementary approach for therapy and overall health.},

   abstract = {The aetiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which are primarily Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, still remains unclear, while the incidence of IBD is constantly increasing, especially in the industrialised countries. Among genetic, environmental, and immunological factors, changes in the composition of the intestinal microflora and diet are indicated as very important in initiating and sustaining inflammation in patients with IBD. Above all nutrients dietary fibre is an especially important component of diet in the context of IBD. A potentially protective effect of high-fibre diet on intestinal disorders was described as early as in 1973. Several trials performed in animal models of IBD and human studies have reported that supplementation of some types of dietary fibre can prolong remission and reduce lesions of the intestinal mucosa during the course of the disease. This paper presents the current state of knowledge on the effects of dietary fibre in IBD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Determination of overweight and obesity prevalence in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at the time of diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective study. The study group consisted of children with new cases of IBD diagnosed in 2005-2013 according to the Porto criteria. Hospital admission records were reviewed for demographic and clinical characteristics. BMI-for-age and gender percentile charts were used to define overweight as >/=85th BMI percentile and obesity as >/=95th BMI percentile. RESULTS: 675 patients were evaluated: 368 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 307 with ulcerative colitis (UC). Of these, 54.8% were boys and 45.2% were girls. There were no statistically significant differences in age, weight, height and disease activity between the CD and UC patients. The UC patients had higher BMI values than the CD patients. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was higher in the UC than the CD patients (4.89% CI95 2.76-7.93 vs. 2.45% CI95 1.12-4.59 and 8.47% CI95 5.61-12.16 vs. 1.9% CI95 0.77-3.88, respectively); the differences were statistically significant (-2.44% CI95 -5.45 to 0.49 and -6.57% CI95 -10 to -3.1, respectively). The risk of overweight/obesity was 3.5 times higher for patients with UC (OR=0.272, CI95 0.14-0.49, p=0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of overweight and obesity in newly diagnosed children with IBD was 8.4% and was higher in patients with UC than in patients with CD. The results of this study have shown that not only malnourished children may suffer from IBD but also children who are overweight or obese at the time of diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Enteric glial cells (EGCs) produce soluble mediators that regulate homeostasis and permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB). We investigated the profile of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites produced by EGCs from rats and from patients with Crohn's disease (CD), compared with controls, along with the ability of one of these metabolites, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), to regulate the permeability of the IEB. METHODS: We isolated EGCs from male Sprague-Dawley rats, intestinal resections of 6 patients with CD, and uninflamed healthy areas of intestinal tissue from 6 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer (controls). EGC-conditioned media was analyzed by high-sensitivity liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to determine PUFA signatures. We used immunostaining to identify 15-HETE-producing enzymes in EGCs and tissues. The effects of human EGCs and 15-HETE on permeability and transepithelial electrical resistance of the IEB were measured using Caco-2 cells; effects on signal transduction proteins were measured with immunoblots. Levels of proteins were reduced in Caco-2 cells using short-hairpin RNAs or proteins were inhibited pharmacologically. Rats were given intraperitoneal injections of 15-HETE or an inhibitor of 15-lipoxygenase (the enzyme that produces 15-HETE); colons were collected and permeability was measured. RESULTS: EGCs expressed 15-lipoxygenase-2 and produced high levels of 15-HETE, which increased IEB resistance and reduced IEB permeability. 15-HETE production was reduced in EGCs from patients with CD compared with controls. EGCs from patients with CD were unable to reduce the permeability of the IEB; the addition of 15-HETE restored permeability to levels of control tissues. Inhibiting 15-HETE production in rats increased the permeability of the IEB in colon tissues. We found that 15-HETE regulates IEB permeability by inhibiting an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and increasing expression of zonula occludens-1. CONCLUSIONS: Enteric glial cells from patients with CD have reduced production of 15-HETE, which controls IEB permeability by inhibiting adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and increasing expression of zonula occludens-1.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Differentiation between intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease is difficult and may require therapeutic trial with anti-tubercular therapy in tuberculosis-endemic regions. AIM: To evaluate the role of therapeutic trial with anti-tubercular therapy in patients with diagnostic confusion between intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease. METHODS: We performed retrospective-comparative (n = 288: 131 patients who received anti-tubercular therapy before being diagnosed as Crohn's disease and 157 intestinal tuberculosis patients) and prospective-validation study (n = 55 patients with diagnostic confusion of intestinal tuberculosis/Crohn's disease). Outcomes assessed were global symptomatic response and endoscopic mucosal healing. RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, among those eventually diagnosed as Crohn's disease, global symptomatic response with anti-tubercular therapy was seen in 38% at 3 months and in 37% who completed 6 months of anti-tubercular therapy. Ninety-four per cent of intestinal tuberculosis patients showed global symptomatic response by 3 months. Endoscopic mucosal healing was seen in only 5% of patients with Crohn's disease compared with 100% of intestinal tuberculosis patients. In the validation cohort, all the patients with intestinal tuberculosis had symptomatic response and endoscopic mucosal healing after 6 months of anti-tubercular therapy. Among the patients with an eventual diagnosis of Crohn's disease, symptomatic response was seen in 64% at 2 months and in 31% who completed 6 months of anti-tubercular therapy, none had mucosal healing. CONCLUSIONS: Disproportionately lower mucosal healing rate despite an overall symptom response with 6 months of anti-tubercular therapy in patients with Crohn's disease suggests a need for repeat colonoscopy for diagnosing Crohn's disease. Patients with intestinal tuberculosis showing significant symptomatic response after 2-3 months of anti-tubercular therapy, suggest that symptom persistence after a therapeutic trial of 3 months of anti-tubercular therapy may indicate the diagnosis of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional implications of IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often develop elevated liver enzymes (ELE), which are frequently a benign, transient finding, but may be related to treatment or IBD-associated liver diseases. Distinguishing benign from pathologic ELE is crucial for focused diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. We sought to characterize the incidence, character, chronicity, degree, and etiology of ELE in children with IBD. METHODS: Institutional review board-approved retrospective review of all of the patients with IBD (2-21 years) seen between October 2009 and October 2012 with >9 months of follow-up were included in the study. We examined body mass index, disease activity, extent, phenotype, concurrent medications, and character, chronicity, degree of enzyme elevation, and final diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 219 of 514 patients with IBD had >/=1 episode of ELE. Five patients were excluded for preexisting liver disease, leaving 214 patients (Crohn disease [CD]: 14.8 +/- 3.5 years, 46% girls; ulcerative colitis [UC]: 14.4 +/- 4.2 years, 37% girls). One hundred forty-eight patients (69%) had a hepatic, 17 (8%) cholestatic, and 49 (23%) mixed character of ELE. There were no significant differences in character, chronicity, or degree of ELE between CD and UC (P = 0.71, P = 0.58, P > 0.33). Of the 128 patients with sufficient data to determine chronicity, 98 (77%) had transient elevations, (CD: n = 66, 75% and UC: n = 32, 80%). Episodes of ELE were idiopathic in 87% of patients with IBD. A final diagnosis of idiopathic ELE was associated with a lower degree of ELE elevation (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with IBD commonly experience transient, idiopathic ELE. Our findings suggest that higher degrees of ELE, specifically alanine aminotransferase, are associated with an etiology that requires more extensive evaluation.},

   abstract = {Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit impaired control of the microbiome in the gut, and 'dysbiosis' is commonly observed. Western diet is a risk factor for the development of IBD, but it may have different effects on gut microbiota between IBD and non-IBD individuals. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) can induce remission in pediatric Crohn's disease with a decrease in gut microbial diversity. Although there are some theoretical benefits, actual treatment effects of prebiotics and probiotics in IBD vary. High-quality studies have shown that VSL#3 (a high-potency probiotic medical food containing eight different strains) exhibits benefits in treating ulcerative colitis, and gut microbial diversity is reduced after treated with VSL#3 in animal models. The effect of fecal microbiome transplantation on IBD is controversial. Increasing microbial diversity compared with impaired handling of bacteria presents a dilemma. Antibiotics are the strongest factors in the reduction of microbiome ecological diversity. Some antibiotics may help to induce remission of the disease. Microbiome alteration has been suggested to be an intrinsic property of IBD and a potential predictor in diagnosis and prognosis. However, the effects of therapeutic modulations are variable; thus, more questions remain to be answered.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Serum albumin (ALB) may be low during acute inflammation, but it is also affected by nutritional status. Therefore, we hypothesized that ALB and the C-reactive protein/ALB ratio (CRP/ALB) may be associated with disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). MATERIAL AND METHODS Altogether, 100 patients with CD and 100 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were retrospectively enrolled in the current study. The patients with CD were subdivided into patients with active disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index >150) and those in remission. ALB levels, CRP levels, and lipid pro fi les were measured. RESULTS ALB and CRP levels and the CRP/ALB ratio were the most useful for differentiating between active and nonactive CD. ALB levels (r=-0.50, P<0.01), CRP levels (r=0.39, P<0.01), and CRP/ALB ratio (r=0.42, P<0.01) all correlated with CD activity. These correlations were more prominent in males. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) representing ALB (0.79) was higher than the AUC representing CRP (0.73) or CRP/ALB ratio (0.75; P>0.05). The AUCs corresponding to ALB level, CRP level, and CRP/ALB ratio were more prominent in males versus females (P<0.05). CRP level (14.55 mg/L), ALB level (34.35 g/L), and CRP/ALB ratio (0.69) had sensitivities of 67.7%, 72.6%, and 59.7%, and speci fi cities of 73.7%, 78.9%, and 81.6%, respectively, for CD activity. CONCLUSIONS In the present retrospective study, we found that ALB level and CRP/ALB ratio were useful biomarkers for identifying CD activity, especially in males. These results suggest that, in addition to inflammation, assessment of patient nutritional status could also aid in identifying CD activity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD)-associated dysbiosis is characterised by a loss of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whose culture supernatant exerts an anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo. However, the chemical nature of the anti-inflammatory compounds has not yet been determined. METHODS: Peptidomic analysis using mass spectrometry was applied to F. prausnitzii supernatant. Anti-inflammatory effects of identified peptides were tested in vitro directly on intestinal epithelial cell lines and on cell lines transfected with a plasmid construction coding for the candidate protein encompassing these peptides. In vivo, the cDNA of the candidate protein was delivered to the gut by recombinant lactic acid bacteria to prevent dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-colitis in mice. RESULTS: The seven peptides, identified in the F. prausnitzii culture supernatants, derived from a single microbial anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), a protein of 15 kDa, and comprising 53% of non-polar residues. This last feature prevented the direct characterisation of the putative anti-inflammatory activity of MAM-derived peptides. Transfection of MAM cDNA in epithelial cells led to a significant decrease in the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway with a dose-dependent effect. Finally, the use of a food-grade bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, delivering a plasmid encoding MAM was able to alleviate DNBS-induced colitis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: A 15 kDa protein with anti-inflammatory properties is produced by F. prausnitzii, a commensal bacterium involved in CD pathogenesis. This protein is able to inhibit the NF-kappaB pathway in intestinal epithelial cells and to prevent colitis in an animal model.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Exploring associations between the gut microbiota and colonic inflammation and assessing sequential changes during exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) may offer clues into the microbial origins of Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Fecal samples (n=117) were collected from 23 CD and 21 healthy children. From CD children fecal samples were collected before, during EEN, and when patients returned to their habitual diets. Microbiota composition and functional capacity were characterized using sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics. RESULTS: Microbial diversity was lower in CD than controls before EEN (P=0.006); differences were observed in 36 genera, 141 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and 44 oligotypes. During EEN, the microbial diversity of CD children further decreased, and the community structure became even more dissimilar than that of controls. Every 10 days on EEN, 0.6 genus diversity equivalents were lost; 34 genera decreased and one increased during EEN. Fecal calprotectin correlated with 35 OTUs, 14 of which accounted for 78% of its variation. OTUs that correlated positively or negatively with calprotectin decreased during EEN. The microbiota of CD patients had a broader functional capacity than healthy controls, but diversity decreased with EEN. Genes involved in membrane transport, sulfur reduction, and nutrient biosynthesis differed between patients and controls. The abundance of genes involved in biotin (P=0.005) and thiamine biosynthesis decreased (P=0.017), whereas those involved in spermidine/putrescine biosynthesis (P=0.031), or the shikimate pathway (P=0.058), increased during EEN. CONCLUSIONS: Disease improvement following treatment with EEN is associated with extensive modulation of the gut microbiome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Specific nutrients or foods have been inconsistently associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) risks. Thus, we investigated associations between diet as a whole, as dietary patterns, and UC and CD risks. METHODS: Within the prospective EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer) study, we set up a nested matched case-control study among 366,351 participants with inflammatory bowel disease data, including 256 incident cases of UC and 117 of CD, and 4 matched controls per case. Dietary intake was recorded at baseline from validated food frequency questionnaires. Incidence rate ratios of developing UC and CD were calculated for quintiles of the Mediterranean diet score and a posteriori dietary patterns produced by factor analysis. RESULTS: No dietary pattern was associated with either UC or CD risks. However, when excluding cases occurring within the first 2 years after dietary assessment, there was a positive association between a "high sugar and soft drinks" pattern and UC risk (incidence rate ratios for the fifth versus first quintile, 1.68 [1.00-2.82]; Ptrend = 0.02). When considering the foods most associated with the pattern, high consumers of sugar and soft drinks were at higher UC risk only if they had low vegetables intakes. CONCLUSIONS: A diet imbalance with high consumption of sugar and soft drinks and low consumption of vegetables was associated with UC risk. Further studies are needed to investigate whether microbiota alterations or other mechanisms mediate this association.},

Lifestyle and clinical variables were identified using an investigator-administered questionnaire, as well as clinical examination and patient case notes. Vitamin D status was evaluated in 2 ways: </= 20 ng/mL vs >/= 21 ng/mL and </= 29 ng/mL vs >/= 30 ng/mL. Disease activity was measured by the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI). Various 25(OH)D threshold concentrations for predicting a higher HBI score were also investigated. RESULTS: On multiple log-binomial regression analysis, higher HBI scores and not having taken vitamin D supplementation in the 6 months prior to enrollment were identified as risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in patients with CD, defined either as </= 20 ng/mL or as </= 29 ng/mL (p < 0.03). Compared to patients with HBI < 5, those with HBI >/= 8 were 2.5 times more likely to have 25(OH)D concentrations </= 21 ng/mL (prevalence risk [PR] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-6.30). The risk was similar, though not as high, when defined as </= 29 ng/mL (PR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.13-3.51). When vitamin D deficiency was defined as <20, <30, <40, and <50 ng/mL, the sensitivity and specificity obtained were 44.9% and 78.8%; 75.5% and 62.4%; 86.7% and 44.7%; and 92.9% and 23.5%, respectively (area under the curve = 0.71; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Low serum 25(OH)D was associated with increased CD activity in a South African cohort.},

   abstract = {Vitamin D deficiency is common among patients with Crohn's disease. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the best measure of an individual's vitamin D status and current cut-off ranges for sufficiency are debatable. Several factors contribute to vitamin D deficiency in Crohn's disease. These include inadequate exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake, impaired conversion of vitamin D to its active metabolite, increased catabolism, increased excretion and genetic variants in vitamin D hydroxylation and transport. The effects of low 25(OH)D on outcomes other than bone health are understudied in Crohn's disease. The aim of the present review is to discuss the potential roles of vitamin D and the possible levels required to achieve them. Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D may have roles in innate and adaptive immunity, in the immune-pathogenesis of Crohn's disease, prevention of Crohn's disease-related hospitalisations and surgery, in reducing disease severity and in colon cancer prevention. The present literature appears to suggest that 25(OH)D concentrations of >/=75 nmol/l may be required for non-skeletal effects; however, further research on optimal levels is required.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises two distinct conditions: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, both of which are chronic, relapsing disorders carrying significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. With growing attention to coordinated healthcare for patients with chronic systemic diseases, this review focuses on the care of IBD patients in remission, their concerns, quality of life, follow-up, the role of primary care physicians and the IBD-specific aspects of long-term care. We did an extensive PubMed search for articles pertaining to IBD patients in remission and, along with the authors' experience, formulated a comprehensive review. The difficulties faced by IBD patients in remission include but are not limited to education and employment concerns, psychosocial issues, problems related to health insurance, nutrition, fertility and infections. This review also addresses newer treatment modalities, the debatable effects of smoking on IBD and the importance of vaccination. IBD in remission can be a challenge due to its multifaceted nature; however, with a coordinated approach by gastroenterologists and other involved practitioners, several of these issues can be addressed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Most patients with Crohn's disease (CD) eventually require an intestinal resection. However, CD frequently recurs after resection. We performed a randomized trial to compare the ability of infliximab vs placebo to prevent CD recurrence. METHODS: We evaluated the efficacy of infliximab in preventing postoperative recurrence of CD in 297 patients at 104 sites worldwide from November 2010 through May 2012. All study patients had undergone ileocolonic resection within 45 days before randomization. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to groups given infliximab (5 mg/kg) or placebo every 8 weeks for 200 weeks. The primary end point was clinical recurrence, defined as a composite outcome consisting of a CD Activity Index score >200 and a >/=70-point increase from baseline, and endoscopic recurrence (Rutgeerts score >/=i2, determined by a central reader) or development of a new or re-draining fistula or abscess, before or at week 76. Endoscopic recurrence was a major secondary end point. RESULTS: A smaller proportion of patients in the infliximab group had a clinical recurrence before or at week 76 compared with the placebo group, but this difference was not statistically significant (12.9% vs 20.0%; absolute risk reduction [ARR] with infliximab, 7.1%; 95% confidence interval: -1.3% to 15.5%; P = .097). A significantly smaller proportion of patients in the infliximab group had endoscopic recurrence compared with the placebo group (30.6% vs 60.0%; ARR with infliximab, 29.4%; 95% confidence interval: 18.6% to 40.2%; P < .001). Additionally, a significantly smaller proportion of patients in the infliximab group had endoscopic recurrence based only on Rutgeerts scores >/=i2 (22.4% vs 51.3%; ARR with infliximab, 28.9%; 95% confidence interval: 18.4% to 39.4%; P < .001). Patients previously treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor agents or those with more than 1 resection were at greater risk for clinical recurrence. The safety profile of infliximab was similar to that from previous reports. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is not superior to placebo in preventing clinical recurrence after CD-related resection. However, infliximab does reduce endoscopic recurrence. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01190839.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Children and adolescents diagnosed as having Crohn disease (CD), a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have increased vulnerability for anxiety symptoms that may be related to disease-related processes. The aims of this article are 3-fold: to report the proportion of pediatric patients with CD whose self-reported anxiety symptoms are indicative of distress, to describe the constellation of anxiety symptoms, and to examine the relation between anxiety and disease symptoms. METHODS: Retrospective medical chart review was performed for 93 youths with CD (ages 9-18 years) who had completed the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders during their gastroenterology visit. Medical records were reviewed for demographic and disease characteristics. the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) was used as a measure of CD activity. RESULTS: Thirty percent of the youths reported experiencing elevated anxiety symptoms (Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorder score >20), and 50% had scored above the cutoff in 1 or more anxiety domains, with school anxiety, general anxiety, and separation anxiety symptoms reported most frequently. Youth rated with moderate/severe disease activity on the HBI (n = 4) self-reported more anxiety symptoms compared with youth with inactive disease (n = 78, P = 0.03). Greater school anxiety was significantly associated with decreased well-being (P = 0.003), more abdominal pain (P < 0.001), and the number of loose stools (P = 0.01). Having extraintestinal symptoms was significantly associated with higher somatic/panic anxiety (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a brief anxiety screen in tertiary pediatric settings may be one approach to identify young patients with CD in distress. Health care providers should consider periodic assessment of school anxiety among youth with CD.},

We analyzed volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the breath of IBD patients and controls for diagnosis and differentiation of IBD as well as their link with disease location, activity, and phenotype. METHODS: A prospective study of diagnostic testing was conducted, recruiting Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), other inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases (OGDs), and healthy controls (HCs), as well as subjects with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). The breath VOC profile was analyzed using selective ion flow tube-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-four subjects (n=24 CD, n=11 UC, n=6 OGD, n=53 HC, n=30 IPAA) were included. The breath metabolome was significantly different in patients with IBD, CD, or UC compared with OGD and HC (7 out of 22 VOCs), but not between CD and UC. No link between the level of VOCs with complications, disease location, and clinical or radiologic disease activity, as well as lab parameters or type of medication was found. Breath VOCs were markedly different in patients with IPAA compared with any other group (17 out of 22 VOCs) and the presence of pouch inflammation did not alter the VOC levels. CONCLUSIONS: A specific breath metabolome is associated with IBD and markedly changes in patients with IPAA. Analysis of a broader spectrum of VOCs can potentially aid in the development of breath prints to diagnose or differentiate inflammatory bowel disorders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data describing the incidence and the risk factors for surgical interventions in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) is inconsistent. Our aim was to describe the rates of intestinal surgery and to identify associated risk factors in a large cohort of children with CD. METHODS: Medical charts of 482 children with CD from the Schneider Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease cohort who were diagnosed between 1981 and 2013 were carefully reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of 482 patients, 143 (29.7%) underwent intestinal surgery with a median follow-up time of 8.6 years (range, 1-30.5). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates of the cumulative probability of CD-related intestinal surgery were 14.2% at 5 years and 24.5% at 10 years from diagnosis. Of these, 14% needed more than one operation. Multivariate Cox models showed that isolated ileal disease (hazard ratio [HR] 2.39, P = 0.008), complicated behavior (penetrating or stricturing) (HR 2.44, P < 0.001) and higher severity indices, at diagnosis, including Harvey-Bradshaw (HR 1.06, P = 0.009) and short Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (HR 1.02, P = 0.001) were associated with increased risk for intestinal surgery. Age, gender, family history of CD, early introduction of immunomodulators, treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha, or diagnosis before the year 2000 did not affect the risk of bowel surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Ileal location, complicated behavior, and higher disease activity indices at diagnosis are independent risk factors for bowel surgery, whereas anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha treatment and diagnosis during the "biological era" are not associated with diminished long-term surgical risk.},

AIMS: We aimed to assess the progression in pediatric-onset CD phenotype on long term follow up. METHODS: Medical charts of pediatric onset CD patients with at least 10 years follow-up were analyzed retrospectively. Disease phenotype was determined at diagnosis and during follow up at different time points. Phenotype was determined according to the Paris classification. The impact of possible predictors on phenotype progression was assessed as well as the association between different therapeutic regimens during disease course and phenotype progression. RESULTS: Progression of disease location, behavior, and perianal involvement was observed in 20%, 38% and 20% of patients, respectively, after a median follow-up of 16.4 (+/-4.4) years. Microscopic ileocolonic disease at diagnosis was significant predictors for progression of disease extent. Treatment with anti tumor necrosis factor-a agents and number of flares per years of follow-up were associated with progression of disease extent, behavior and perianal involvement. CONCLUSION: Disease extent, behavior and prevalence of perianal disease change significantly over time in pediatric-onset CD. In our cohort, most clinical, laboratory and endoscopic parameters do not serve as predictors for long-term disease progression.},

The aetiology of Crohn's disease is complex and may include defects in peptidoglycan recognition, and/or failures in the establishment of intestinal tolerance. We have recently described a novel constitutive endogenous delivery system for the translocation of nanomineral-antigen-peptidoglycan (NAP) conjugates to antigen presenting cells (APCs) in intestinal lymphoid patches. In mice NAP conjugate delivery to APCs results in high surface expression of the immuno-modulatory molecule programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1). Here we report that NAP conjugate positive APCs in human ileal tissues from individuals with ulcerative colitis and intestinal carcinomas, also have high expression of PD-L1. However, NAP-conjugate positive APCs in intestinal tissue from patients with Crohn's disease show selective failure in PD-L1 expression. Therefore, in Crohn's disease intestinal antigen taken up by lymphoid patch APCs will be presented without PD-L1 induced tolerogenic signalling, perhaps initiating disease.},

The infected mice correspond to genetic line SAMP1/YitFc, which have 100% immune predisposition to develop Crohn's disease-like spontaneous pathologies, namely, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Pathogen update based on a scoping review of the literature and our clinical observations and experimentation are discussed. The unwanted infection of germ-free mice (immunologically prone to suffer chronic inflammation) with human pathogen A. sydowii resulted in no overt signs of clinical disease over 3-week exposure period, or during DSS-induced colitis experiments. Results and observations suggest that A. sydowii alone has limited clinical effect in immunocompromised germ-free mice or that other commensal microbial flora is required for Aspergillus-associated disease to occur.},

   abstract = {The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease, are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract most often diagnosed in adolescence and young adulthood, with a rising incidence in pediatric populations. These disorders are common enough in children that most pediatricians and other pediatric clinicians will encounter children with IBD in their general practice. Inflammatory bowel disease is caused by a dysregulated mucosal immune response to the intestinal microflora in genetically predisposed hosts. Although children can present with the classic symptoms of weight loss, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, many present with nonclassic symptoms of isolated poor growth, anemia, or other extraintestinal manifestations. Once IBD is diagnosed, the goals of therapy consist of eliminating symptoms, normalizing quality of life, restoring growth, and preventing complications while minimizing the adverse effects of medications. Unique considerations when treating children and adolescents with IBD include attention to the effects of the disease on growth and development, bone health, and psychosocial functioning. The purpose of this review is to provide a contemporary overview of the epidemiologic features, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of IBD in children and adolescents.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Imaging predictors for surgery in children with Crohn disease are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To identify imaging features of the terminal ileum on short-interval bowel ultrasound (US) and MR enterography (MRE) in children with Crohn disease requiring surgical bowel resection and those managed by medical therapy alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated patients 18 years and younger with Crohn disease undergoing short-interval bowel US and MRE (within 2 months of one another), as well as subsequent ileocecectomy or endoscopy within 3 months of imaging. Appearance of the terminal ileum on both modalities was compared between surgical patients and those managed with medical therapy, with the following parameters assessed: bowel wall thickness, mural stratification, vascularity, fibrofatty proliferation, abscess, fistula and stricture on bowel US; bowel wall thickness, T2 ratio, enhancement pattern, mesenteric edema, fibrofatty proliferation, abscess, fistula and stricture on MRE. A two-sided t-test was used to compare means, a Mann-Whitney U analysis was used for non-parametric parameter scores, and a chi-square or two-sided Fisher exact test compared categorical variables. Imaging findings in surgical patients were correlated with location-matched histopathological scores of inflammation and fibrosis using a scoring system adapted from the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn Disease, and a Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to compare inflammation and fibrosis on histopathology. RESULTS: Twenty-two surgical patients (mean age: 16.5 years; male/female: 13/9) and 20 nonsurgical patients (mean age: 14.8; M/F: 8/12) were included in the final analysis. On US, the surgical group demonstrated significantly increased mean bowel wall thickness (6.1 mm vs. 4.7 mm for the nonsurgical group; P = 0.01), loss of mural stratification (odds ratio [OR] = 6.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-28.4; P = 0.02) and increased fibrofatty proliferation (P = 0.04). On MRE, the surgical group showed increased mean bowel wall thickness (9.1 mm vs. 7.2 mm for the nonsurgical group; P = 0.02), increased mean T2 ratio (4.6 vs. 3.6 for the nonsurgical group; P = 0.03), different enhancement patterns (P = 0.03), increased mesenteric edema (P = 0.001) and increased stricture formation (OR = 8.2; 95% CI: 1.8-36.4; P = 0.005). Nineteen of 22 ileocecectomy specimens showed severe inflammation and 21/22 showed severe fibrosis, with significant correlation between inflammation and fibrosis scores (rho = 0.55; P = 0.008); however, correlation with imaging findings was limited by the uniformity of findings on histopathology. CONCLUSION: Children with terminal ileal Crohn disease requiring surgical bowel resection demonstrate more severe manifestations of imaging features traditionally associated with both active inflammation and chronic fibrosis than those managed medically on US and MRE, findings that are corroborated by histopathology. These features may potentially serve as imaging biomarkers indicating the necessity for surgical intervention.},

   abstract = {Elemental diet (ED) has been used widely in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, especially with the management of Crohn's disease. This modality of diets provides all essential nutrients, and contains protein in the form of free amino acids that are theoretically easily absorbed. High output ileostomies are a rare but important complications of stoma formation following bowel surgery. Treatments could be challenging and include anti-diarrhoeals, octreotide and proton pump inhibitors. There is very little research regarding the use of elemental diets in the treatment of patients with post-operative high ileostomy outputs. Adequate management of high output ileostomies might prevent significant morbidity. In this case report, we describe a patient who underwent a subtotal colectomy for ulcerative colitis complicated by refractory high ileostomy output despite maximal standard medical therapy for years. The ileostomy output was dramatically reduced following the introduction of an elemental diet. This case suggests a possible role for the introduction of an elemental diet in the management of high output ileostomies. Besides presenting this case with high output ileostomy, we reviewed the role of ED in other gastrointestinal disorders.},

   abstract = {Following loss of functional small bowel surface area due to surgical resection for therapy of Crohn's disease, ischemia, trauma or other disorders, the remnant gut undergoes a morphometric and functional compensatory adaptive response which has been best characterized in preclinical models. Increased crypt cell proliferation results in increased villus height, crypt depth and villus hyperplasia, accompanied by increased nutrient, fluid and electrolyte absorption. Clinical observations suggest that functional adaptation occurs in humans. In the immediate postoperative period, patients with substantial small bowel resection have massive fluid and electrolyte loss with reduced nutrient absorption. For many patients, the adaptive response permits partial or complete weaning from parenteral nutrition (PN), within two years following resection. However, others have life-long PN dependence. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the gut adaptive response is critical for developing novel therapies for short bowel syndrome. Herein we present a summary of key studies that seek to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate post-resection adaptation, focusing on stem and crypt cell proliferation, epithelial differentiation, apoptosis, enterocyte function and the role of growth factors and the enteric nervous system.},

   abstract = {The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is steadily in the rise in Western as well as in developing countries paralleling the increase of westernized diets, characterized by high protein and fat as well as excessive sugar intake, with less vegetables and fiber. An interesting hypothesis is that environmental (food-) triggered changes of the intestinal microbiome might cause a proinflammatory state preceding the development of IBD. Indeed, an intact intestinal epithelial barrier assuring a normal bacterial clearance of the intestinal surface is crucial to guarantee intestinal homeostasis. Any factors affecting the epithelial barrier function directly or indirectly may impact on this homeostasis, as well as any changes of the intestinal microbial composition. It is intriguing to learn that some frequently used food components impact on the quality of the intestinal barrier, as well as on the composition of the intestinal microbiome. This highlights the close interaction between living conditions, hygiene, food habits and food quality with the bacterial composition of the intestinal microbiome and the activation status of the intestinal immune system. There is clear evidence that nutritional therapy is highly successful in the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD). Exclusive enteral nutrition is well established as induction therapy of CD. New diets, such as a CD exclusion diet or defined diets (specific carbohydrate diets, FODMAP diet, Paleolithic diet) are being discussed as treatment options for IBD. Well-designed clinical trials in IBD are urgently required to define the precise role of each of these diets in the prevention or management of IBD. Up to now, the role of diet in IBD is highly undermined by lay and anecdotal reports without sufficient scientific proof.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although paediatric-onset IBD is becoming more common, few medications have a registered paediatric indication. There are multiple hurdles to performing clinical trials in children, emphasising the importance of choosing an appropriate outcome measure, which can facilitate enrolment, and thereby also drug approval. The aim of this consensus statement is to highlight paediatric specific issues and key factors critical for the optimal conduct of paediatric IBD trials. DESIGN: The Paediatric European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) committee has established an international expert panel to determine the best outcome measures in paediatric IBD, following a literature search and a modified Delphi process. All recommendations were endorsed by at least 80% agreement. RESULTS: Recognising the importance of mucosal healing (MH), the panel defined steroid-free MH as primary outcome measure for all drugs of new category with one or two postintervention endoscopies per trial (at 8-12 weeks and/or 54 weeks). Since endoscopic evaluation is a barrier for recruitment in children, trials with medications already shown to induce MH in children or adults, could use paediatric-specific disease activity scores as primary outcome, including a modified Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index in Crohn's disease and the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index in UC. Secondary outcomes should include safety issues, MR enterography-based damage and inflammatory scores (in Crohn's disease), faecal calprotectin, quality of life scales, and a patient-reported outcome. CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial to perform paediatric trials early in the development of new drugs in order to reduce off-label use of IBD medication in children. The thoughtful choice of feasible and standardised outcome measures can help move us towards this goal.},

There is a need of biomarkers for differentiation between these two disorders. Colonic biopsies from inflamed mucosa of treatment-naive patients with ITB, CD and controls were used for analysis. Protein extracted from biopsies was digested with trypsin and resulting peptides were labeled with iTRAQ reagents. The peptides were subsequently analyzed using LC-MS/MS for identification and quantification. Gene ontology annotation for proteins was analyzed in PANTHER. Validation experiments were done for six differentially expressed proteins using immunohistochemistry. 533 proteins were identified and 241 proteins were quantified from 5 sets of iTRAQ experiments. While 63 were differentially expressed in colonic mucosa of patients with CD and ITB in at least one set of iTRAQ experiment, 11 proteins were differentially expressed in more than one set of experiments. Six proteins used for validation using immunohistochemistry in a larger cohort of patients; none of them however was differentially expressed in patients with ITB and CD. There are differentially expressed proteins in tissue proteome of CD and ITB. Further experiments are required using a larger cohort of homogeneous tissue samples.},

   abstract = {Malabsorption is a disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that leads to defective digestion, absorption and transport of important nutrients across the intestinal wall. Small intestine is the major site where most of the nutrients are absorbed. There are three main mechanisms of malabsorption; premucosal, mucosal and postmucosal. Premucosal malabsorption is the inadequate digestion due to improper mixing of gastrointestinal enzymes and bile with chyme. This could be because of surgical resection of the small intestine or a congenital deficiency of the enzymes and bile responsible for digestion e.g. postgastrectomy, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis, gallstones, cholangitis etc. Mucosal malabsorption occurs in celiac disease, tropical sprue, Crohn's disease etc. Postmucosal condition arises due to impaired nutrients transport e.g. intestinal lymphangiectasia, macroglobulinemia etc. Disorders of malabsorption lead to decreased iron absorption and produce iron deficiency anemia. Using the index terms malabsorption, postgastrectomy, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis, gallstones, cholangitis, celiac disease, tropical sprue, Crohn's disease intestinal lymphangiectasia, macroglobulinemia and iron deficiency anemia the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease (CD) is caused by a complex interplay among genetic, microbial and environmental factors. ATG16L1 is an important genetic factor involved in innate immunity, including autophagy and phagocytosis of microbial components from the gut. We investigated the effect of inflammation on the composition of microbiota in the ileal mucosa of CD patients in relation to the ATG16L1 risk status. DESIGN: Biopsies (n=35) were obtained from inflamed and non-inflamed regions of the terminal ileum of 11 CD patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk allele (ATG16L1-T300A) and 9 CD patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 protective allele (ATG16L1-T300). Biopsy DNA was extracted and the bacterial composition analysed by pyrosequencing. Intracellular survival rates of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) were analysed by determining colony forming units after exposure to monocytes isolated from healthy volunteers homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk or protective allele. RESULTS: Inflamed ileal tissue from patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk allele contained increased numbers of Fusobacteriaceae, whereas inflamed ileal tissue of patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 protective allele showed decreased numbers of Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae and increased Lachnospiraceae. The ATG16L1 allele did not affect the bacterial composition in the non-inflamed ileal tissue. Monocytes homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk allele showed impaired killing of AIEC under inflammatory conditions compared with those homozygous for the ATG16L1 protective allele. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients homozygous for the ATG16L1-T300A risk allele show impaired clearance of pathosymbionts in ileal inflammation indicating that ATG16L1 is essential for effective elimination of pathosymbionts upon inflammation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Inconsistent findings have been published regarding vitamin D status among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and the association with disease severity. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis evaluating serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D and 1,25 dehydroxyvitamin D among CD patients compared with healthy and non-healthy controls, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, and the association with disease. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Google Scholar up to March 2015 for observational studies assessing serum vitamin D levels in CD patients. A total of 63 studies were included in the following four meta-analyses: 1) a meta-analysis on the mean difference of 25(OH)D levels in CD patients compared with healthy (number of studies = 27) and non-healthy (n = 25) controls; 2) a meta-analysis on the mean difference of 1,25(OH)2 D3 levels in CD patients compared with healthy (n = 7) and non-healthy (n = 8) controls; 3) a meta-analysis on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (n = 34); 4) a meta-analysis on the correlation coefficients between vitamin D status severity of CD (n = 6). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to discover possible sources of between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: It was found that CD patients had lower levels of 25(OH)D compared with healthy (-3.99 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.91 to -2.08) but not non-healthy controls (-1.07 ng/mL; 95% CI: -2.84 to 0.70). There was also no significant mean difference for 1,25(OH)2 D3 for both healthy and non-healthy controls. Meta-analysis on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency showed an overall prevalence of 57.7% (95% CI: 0.502-0.649). An inverse association was observed between serum vitamin D and severity of CD (-0.36; 95% CI: -0.48 to -0.24). Meta-regression showed that mean levels of 25(OH)D were decreased 0.09 for each unit change of latitude among CD patients compared with healthy controls (B = -0.09, P = 0.004, I(2) residual = 86.08%). CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients with Crohn's disease had lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared with their healthy counterparts, and more than half of them have hypovitaminosis D. Moreover, there was an inverse correlation between circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and severity of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses 2 disorders of unknown etiology: Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). There has been a continuous search for markers for disease activity. Eosinophils are granulocytic leukocytes that are implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and significance of peripheral eosinophilia (PE) at diagnosis in children with IBD. METHODS: A comprehensive chart review of all children with diagnosed as having IBD between January 2006 and August 2014 was performed. Patients with PE at diagnosis were compared with those without in relation to disease clinical activity and disease course. RESULTS: A total of 109 children (mean age 14.6 +/- 2.77, range 4.5-17.9 years, 55 boys) with IBD (68 with CD and 41 with UC) who were studied for a mean duration of 2.82 +/- 1.89 (range 0.1-9.2 years) were identified. At diagnosis, 44 (40.4%) children had PE, which was more prevalent in patients with UC compared with those with CD (61.3% vs 36.3%, P < 0.05). At diagnosis, PE was more common in patients with high eosinophilic count in colonic biopsy samples (P < 0.01) and was significantly associated with disease activity as indicated by Pediatric CD Activity Index for children with CD (P < 0.05), Pediatric UC Activity Index for children with UC (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: PE is a common finding at diagnosis in children with IBD especially in those with UC. Patients with PE at diagnosis are more likely to present with higher clinical activity indices. PE is associated with more eosinophils in colonic biopsy samples.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic inflammation of the small intestine and colon caused by a dysregulated immune response to host intestinal microbiota in genetically susceptible subjects. A number of fermented dairy products contain lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria, some of which have been characterized as probiotics that can modify the gut microbiota and may be beneficial for the treatment and the prevention of IBD. The objective of this review was to carry out a systematic search of LAB and bifidobacteria probiotics and IBD, using the PubMed and Scopus databases, defined by a specific equation using MeSH terms and limited to human clinical trials. The use of probiotics and/or synbiotics has positive effects in the treatment and maintenance of UC, whereas in CD clear effectiveness has only been shown for synbiotics. Furthermore, in other associated IBD pathologies, such as pouchitis and cholangitis, LAB and bifidobacteria probiotics can provide a benefit through the improvement of clinical symptoms. However, more studies are needed to understand their mechanisms of action and in this way to understand the effect of probiotics prior to their use as coadjuvants in the therapy and prevention of IBD conditions.},

Deterioration of this delicate process may result in devastating autoinflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which primarily comprises Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Efficacious interventions to regulate proinflammatory signals, which play critical roles in IBD, require further scientific investigation. We recently demonstrated that rebalancing intestinal immunity via the surface layer protein A (SlpA) from Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM potentially represents a feasible therapeutic approach to restore intestinal homeostasis. To expand on these findings, we established a new method of purifying bacterial SlpA, a new SlpA-specific monoclonal antibody, and found no SlpA-associated toxicity in mice. Thus, these data may assist in our efforts to determine the immune regulatory efficacy of SlpA in humans.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic intestinal disorder of unknown etiology involving any section of the gastrointestinal tract often associated with protein-energy malnutrition (PEM). Increased resting energy expenditure (REE) unmatched by adequate dietary intake is amongst the pathogenetic mechanisms proposed for PEM. Aim of this study was to evaluate REE in CD patients receiving or not immuno-suppressive therapy as compared to controls. METHODS: 36 CD patients (22 M and 14 F, age range 18-55 years) clinically stable and without complications since at least 6 month were studied. REE was evaluated by indirect calorimetry and body composition by BIA. Full biochemistry was performed. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (G1 = 12 patients) without and Group 2 (G2 = 24 patients) with immuno-suppressive therapy. RESULTS: The two groups were similar for age, height and BMI whereas significantly differed for weight (G1 vs G2: 56.9 +/- 7.44 vs 62.3 +/- 8.34 kg), fat free mass (FFM: 40.4 +/- 5.73 vs 48.2 +/- 7.06 kg), fat mass (FM: 17.0 +/- 3.55 vs 13.9 +/- 5.54 kg) and phase angle (PA: 5.6 +/- 1.4 vs 6.5 +/- 1.0 degrees ). Serum inflammation parameters were significantly higher in G1 than in G2: hs-PCR: 7.76 +/- 14.2 vs 7.16 +/- 13.4 mg/dl; alfa 2-protein: 11.7 +/- 3.69 vs 9.74 +/- 2.08 mg/dl; fibrinogen: 424 +/- 174 vs 334 +/- 118 mg/dl (p < 0.05). REE was higher in G2 vs G1: 1383 +/- 267 vs 1582 +/- 253kcal/die (p < 0.05) both in men: 1579 +/- 314 vs 1640 +/- 203 and women: 1267 +/- 140 vs 1380 +/- 132. Nevertheless, when corrected for FFM, REE resulted higher in G1 than G2 (34.8 +/- 4.89 vs 33.0 +/- 4.35 kcal/kg, p < 0.05) group, also higher compared to our, age and sex matched, control population (REE/FFM: 30.9 +/- 4.5 kcal/kg). CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results show that REE when adjusted for FFM is increased in clinically stable CD patients and mildly reduced by immunosuppressive therapy possibly through a direct action on inflammation and on body composition characteristics.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 [IP-10] mediates immune cell trafficking from the circulation to the inflamed colon and decreases gut epithelial cell survival. IP-10 expression is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis [UC]. We report efficacy and safety results from a dose-ranging induction study of eldelumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to IP-10, in moderately to severely active UC. METHODS: A total of 252 adults with UC [Mayo score >/= 6 and endoscopic subscore >/= 2] were randomised 1:1:1 to placebo or eldelumab 15 or 25 mg/kg administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8 and every other week thereafter. The primary endpoint was clinical remission [Mayo score </= 2; no individual subscale score > 1] at Week 11. Key secondary endpoints included Mayo score clinical response and mucosal healing at Week 11. RESULTS: Neither eldelumab 15 or 25 mg/kg resulted in significant increases vs placebo in the proportion of patients achieving Week 11 clinical remission. Remission and response rates were 17.6% and 47.1% with eldelumab 25mg/kg, 13.1% and 44.0% with eldelumab 15mg/kg, and 9.6% and 31.3% with placebo. Clinical remission and response rates were higher in anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-naive patients treated with eldelumab compared with placebo. Eldelumab treatment was well tolerated and no immunogenicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The primary endpoint was not achieved with induction treatment with eldelumab 15 or 25 mg/kg in patients with UC. Trends towards clinical remission and response were observed in the overall population and were more pronounced in anti-TNF naive patients. Eldelumab safety signals were consistent with those reported previously [ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01294410].},

METHODS: Forty-seven consecutive PCD patients treated via an institutional protocol of ileocolectomy after a 7-day period of percutaneous abscess drainage were retrospectively compared with 160 consecutive patients who underwent an elective ileocolectomy for Crohn's disease (ECD) between 1992 and 2014. Outcomes were compared using univariate analysis and propensity score matching. RESULTS: Univariate analysis demonstrated significant differences in ileostomy rates (PCD: 48.9% vs ECD: 18.8%; P = .001), 30-day readmissions (PCD: 38.3% vs ECD: 18.8%; P = .01), and overall 30-day postoperative complications (PCD: 29.8% vs ECD: 15%; P = .03). After matching, a statistically significant difference was retained in ileostomy rates (P = .02) and 30-day readmissions (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Early operative intervention after percutaneous drainage in perforating CD may be associated with a high incidence of diversions and readmissions.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An increasing body of evidence has linked diet to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Most of our current knowledge pertains to the link between diet and Crohn's disease. Exclusive enteral nutrition and partial enteral nutrition are the best known dietary intervention for the induction of remission and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease both in children and in adults, but the mechanism whereby these interventions may cause or maintain remission and mucosal healing has remained elusive. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shed light on the possible mechanisms of response to dietary intervention. Epidemiological and rodent model studies over the last year have supplied us with several dietary candidates for an effect of diet on inflammation and disease pathogenesis. Others have shed insight into the effect of diet on dysbiosis and the microbiota. An elimination diet based on some of these candidates has shown clinical efficacy, and bridged the knowledge obtained from rodent models to a human intervention. SUMMARY: These studies may allow better understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD and provide new tools to treat these difficult diseases. Elimination diets based on the identification of deleterious dietary components may pave the way for an improved control of the disease in the future. VIDEO ABSTRACT: http://links.lww.com/COG/A10.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic debilitating disorders of unknown etiology, consisting of two main conditions, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Major advances have recently taken place in human genetic studies of IBD and over 160 risk loci for these two diseases have been uncovered. These genetic data highlight a key role for genes that code for immunological and epithelial barrier functions. Environmental factors also make substantial contributions to the pathogenesis of IBD and account for the growing incidence of the diseases around the world. Intestinal microbiota creates resistance to infection, provides nutrients, and educates the immune system and in many ways has a significant impact on human health. Aberrant microbiota composition and decreased diversity (dysbiotic microbiota) are key etiopathological events in IBD. Dysbiotic microbiota can lead to loss of normal, regulatory immune effects in the gut mucosa. This may play a central role in the development and perpetuation of chronic inflammation. Further, the expression of specific innate immune receptors that recognize microbes is altered in the IBD epithelium. Therefore, the combination of host side epithelial barrier functions and the presence of dysbiotic microbiota in the gut together promote inflammation. New therapeutic options targeting microbiota are currently considered for IBD and they may, in the future, provide means to reverse the pathogenic host-microbiota relationship into a symbiotic one. In this review, the focus is on the intestinal microbiota and host-microbe interactions in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mucosal healing predicts clinical remission and improved outcomes in patients with Crohn disease (CD). Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is a noninvasive imaging modality that can assess small and large bowel wall inflammation. Evidence suggests that MRE may be an acceptable alternative to evaluate mucosal healing over endoscopy. Our objective is to determine whether MRE remission predicts clinical remission at follow-up in children with CD. METHODS: We performed an institutional review board-approved retrospecitve chart review using our prospectively maintained MRE CD database. Inclusion criteria were all children who underwent an MRE more than 6 months after diagnosis with CD who had follow-up of at least 1 year from imaging. RESULTS: A total of 101 children with CD underwent MRE, a median of 1.3 years from diagnosis with a median follow-up of 2.8 years after MRE. Active inflammation was detected in 65 MRE studies, whereas 36 MRE studies demonstrated MRE remission. A total of 88.9% of children demonstrating MRE remission were in clinical remission at follow-up, whereas only 44.6% of those demonstrating MRE active inflammation achieved clinical remission. Children demonstrating MRE-active inflammation were more likely to have a change in medication (44.6% vs 8.3%) and more likely to undergo surgery (18.5% vs 2.8%). CONCLUSIONS: MRE remission is associated with clinical remission at follow-up at least 1 year after MRE. MRE remission was associated with fewer medication changes and fewer surgeries suggesting that, similar to endoscopic remission, MRE remission demonstrates improved outcome. Additional research is needed to confirm that MRE can be used as a surrogate for mucosal healing.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota is associated with Crohn's disease (CD). Functional evidence for a causal role of bacteria in the development of chronic small intestinal inflammation is lacking. Similar to human pathology, TNF(deltaARE) mice develop a tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-driven CD-like transmural inflammation with predominant ileal involvement. DESIGN: Heterozygous TNF(deltaARE) mice and wildtype (WT) littermates were housed under conventional (CONV), specific pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) conditions. Microbial communities were analysed by high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Metaproteomes were measured using LC-MS. Temporal and spatial resolution of disease development was followed after antibiotic treatment and transfer of microbial communities into GF mice. Granulocyte infiltration and Paneth cell function was assessed by immunofluorescence and gene expression analysis. RESULTS: GF-TNF(deltaARE) mice were free of inflammation in the gut and antibiotic treatment of CONV-TNF(deltaARE) mice attenuated ileitis but not colitis, demonstrating that disease severity and location are microbiota-dependent. SPF-TNF(deltaARE) mice developed distinct ileitis-phenotypes associated with gradual loss of antimicrobial defence. 16S analysis and metaproteomics revealed specific compositional and functional alterations of bacterial communities in inflamed mice. Transplantation of disease-associated but not healthy microbiota transmitted CD-like ileitis to GF-TNF(deltaARE) recipients and triggered loss of lysozyme and cryptdin-2 expression. Monoassociation of GF-TNF(deltaARE) mice with the human CD-related Escherichia coli LF82 did not induce ileitis. CONCLUSIONS: We provide clear experimental evidence for the causal role of gut bacterial dysbiosis in the development of chronic ileal inflammation with subsequent failure of Paneth cell function.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The manifestation of enterocutaneous fistulas is varied. They can range from controlled secretion via the abdominal wall to septic disease. The disease is categorised into low-, moderate- and high-output fistulas. Often the only option is surgical treatment. Occasionally, there is spontaneous healing under conservative treatment. The aim of this study was to work out a possible subgroup of patients who benefit from conservative treatment. Material und Methods: Ninety-nine patients were treated for enterocutaneous fistulas from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2005. Seventy patients underwent surgery, 29 patients were treated conservatively. All data was collected prospectively using an admission form and was analysed retrospectively. Conservative treatment consisted of fasting with parenteral nutrition, while fistulas in the surgical group were treated by suture repair or resection. Additive treatments such as vacuum dressings or TNF-alpha medication for patients with Crohn's disease were not performed. RESULTS: In our study we achieved a total cure rate of 69%, with an average hospital stay of 38 days. Surgical treatment led to significantly better results compared with conservative treatment (83 vs. 34%). Mortality in the surgical group was distinctly, but not significantly reduced at 7%, compared with 14% in the conservative group. The fistulas that healed after conservative treatment were low-output fistulas only. CONCLUSION: Enterocutaneous fistulas are diseases associated with long hospital stays and, therefore, expensive treatment. Low-output fistulas may heal spontaneously. The best results are achieved by surgical treatment. More recent treatments such as vacuum therapy and TNF-alpha medication for patients with Crohn's disease are promising approaches. In the future, many of these will have to be combined with surgical treatment.},

   abstract = {Anti-TNFalpha therapy decreases inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD). However, its ability to decrease fibrosis and alter the natural history of CD is not established. Anti-TNF-alpha prevents inflammation and fibrosis in the peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (PG-PS) model of CD. Here we studied anti-TNF-alpha in a treatment paradigm. PG-PS or human serum albumin (HSA; control) was injected into bowel wall of anesthetized Lewis rats at laparotomy. Mouse anti-mouse TNF-alpha or vehicle treatment was begun day (d)1, d7, or d14 postlaparotomy. Rats were euthanized d21-23. Gross abdominal and histologic findings were scored. Cecal levels of relevant mRNAs were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. There was a stepwise loss of responsiveness when anti-TNFalpha was begun on d7 and d14 compared with d1 that was seen in the percent decrease in the median gross abdominal score and histologic inflammation score in PG-PS-injected rats [as %decrease; gross abdominal score: d1 = 75% (P = 0.003), d7 = 57% (P = 0.18), d14 = no change (P = 0.99); histologic inflammation: d1 = 57% (P = 0.006), d7 = 50% (P = 0.019), d14 = no change (P = 0.99)]. This was also reflected in changes in IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IGF-I, TGF-beta1, procollagen I, and procollagen III mRNAs that were decreased or trended downward in PG-PS-injected animals given anti-TNF-alpha beginning d1 or d7 compared with vehicle-treated rats; there was no effect if anti-TNF-alpha was begun d14. This change in responsiveness to anti-TNFalpha therapy was coincident with a major shift in the cytokine milieu observed on d14 in the PG-PS injected rats (vehicle treated). Our data are consistent with the clinical observation that improved outcomes occur when anti-TNF-alpha therapy is initiated early in the course of CD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition with numerous nutrition implications, including an increased risk of malnutrition and various nutrient deficiencies. Surgical interventions are often necessary in the treatment of IBD, and patients with IBD presenting for surgery often have multiple issues, including acute inflammatory processes, malnutrition, anemia, and infections, which may increase the likelihood of poor surgical outcomes. Thus, determining adjunctive treatments that may decrease postoperative complications is paramount. Although enteral nutrition (EN) is considered the preferred nutrition support modality when the gastrointestinal tract is accessible and functional, parenteral nutrition (PN) may provide a suitable alternative when the use of EN is not feasible. The aim of this review is to evaluate the currently available literature on the impact of perioperative PN on postoperative complications, disease severity, and nutrition status in adults with IBD. Six studies within the past 10 years investigated this topic and are analyzed here. Results indicate general trends toward improvements in postoperative outcomes, disease severity, and nutrition status associated with perioperative PN use. Although results appear promising, additional, larger studies with an emphasis on PN composition will improve our understanding of the benefits of perioperative PN in adults with IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1), a lysosomal lipid storage disorder that causes neurodegeneration and liver damage, can present with IBD, but neither the significance nor the functional mechanism of this association is clear. We studied bacterial handling and antibacterial autophagy in patients with NPC1. DESIGN: We characterised intestinal inflammation in 14 patients with NPC1 who developed IBD. We investigated bacterial handling and cytokine production of NPC1 monocytes or macrophages in vitro and compared NPC1-associated functional defects to those caused by IBD-associated nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) variants or mutations in X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP). RESULTS: Patients with the lysosomal lipid storage disorder NPC1 have increased susceptibility to early-onset fistulising colitis with granuloma formation, reminiscent of Crohn's disease (CD). Mutations in NPC1 cause impaired autophagy due to defective autophagosome function that abolishes NOD2-mediated bacterial handling in vitro similar to variants in NOD2 or XIAP deficiency. In contrast to genetic NOD2 and XIAP variants, NPC1 mutations do not impair NOD2-receptor-interacting kinase 2 (RIPK2)-XIAP-dependent cytokine production. Pharmacological activation of autophagy can rescue bacterial clearance in macrophages in vitro by increasing the autophagic flux and bypassing defects in NPC1. CONCLUSIONS: NPC1 confers increased risk of early-onset severe CD. Our data support the concept that genetic defects at different checkpoints of selective autophagy cause a shared outcome of CD-like immunopathology linking monogenic and polygenic forms of IBD. Muramyl dipeptide-driven cytokine responses and antibacterial autophagy induction are parallel and independent signalling cascades downstream of the NOD2-RIPK2-XIAP complex.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Children with perianal Crohn's disease (PCD) are a unique and diverse patient population. The purpose of this study was to describe the spectrum of disease and role of surgery. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all children having at least one surgical intervention for PCD over 10 years was performed. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients (63% male) aged 0.5-17 (median 13) years were identified. Perianal disease consisted of skin tags (49%), superficial fistulae (49%), deep fistulae (37%), superficial abscesses (68%), deep abscesses (9%), skin breakdown (19%), and anal strictures (7%). 84% received anti-TNF therapy, with 27% treated with a second anti-TNF medication. Minor surgical procedures, commonly done during anti-TNF therapy, included abscess drainage (67%) and seton placement (33%). Major surgical procedures, done almost exclusively after anti-TNF failure, included defunctioning ileostomy (23%) and subtotal colectomy (9%). Follow-up ranged from 7 to 160 (median 54) months. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric PCD has a wide range of disease severity. Minor surgery provides adequate drainage before and during anti-TNF therapy, while major surgery plays a role in medically refractory disease. Appropriate surgical intervention remains an important part of the treatment paradigm.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity has been linked with a proinflammatory state and the development of inflammatory diseases. Data on the clinical course and treatment of obese patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are limited. We used an institutional IBD registry to investigate the impact of obesity on IBD severity and treatment. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data for 3 years (2009-2011). Patients with IBD were categorized by body mass index (BMI). IBD-related quality of life, biochemical markers of inflammation, comorbidities, health care utilization, and treatment were characterized. Obesity was defined as a BMI >/=30 (type I: 30-34.9, type II: 35-39.9, and type III >/=40). RESULTS: Among 1494 patients with IBD, 71.9% were above their ideal BMI and 31.5% were obese. Obesity was more common in ulcerative colitis compared with patients with Crohn's disease (P = 0.04). Obese class II and class III patients were predominantly female. Obesity in IBD was associated with female gender (P < 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (P < 0.001), hypertension (P < 0.001), hyperlipidemia (P < 0.001), poor quality of life (P < 0.0001), and increased rates of C-reactive protein elevation (P = 0.008). In logistic regression analysis, quality of life and C-reactive protein elevation were not independently correlated with obesity. There was no association between increasing BMI and annual prednisone use, emergency department visits, hospitalization, and surgery. Obesity was associated with lower milligrams per kilogram doses of purine analogs and biologics. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity in IBD is not associated with increased health care utilization and IBD-related surgeries. Optimal regimens for drug dosing in obese patients with IBD have yet to be defined.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and unclassified IBD, continues to cause significant morbidity. While its incidence is increasing, no clear etiology and no cure have yet been discovered. Recent findings suggest that IBD may have a multifactorial etiology, where complex interactions between genetics, epigenetics, environmental factors (including diet but also infections, antibiotics, and sanitation), and host immune system lead to abnormal immune responses and chronic inflammation. Over the past years, the role of altered gut microbiota (in both composition and function) in IBD pathogenesis has emerged as an outstanding area of interest. According to new findings, gut dysbiosis may appear as a key element in initiation of inflammation in IBD and its complications. Moreover, complex metagenomic studies provide possibilities to distinguish between IBD types and appreciate severity and prognosis of the disease, as well as response to therapy. This review provides an updated knowledge of recent findings linking altered bacterial composition and functions, viruses, and fungi to IBD pathogenesis. It also highlights the complex genetic, epigenetic, immune, and microbial interactions in relation to environmental factors (including diet). We overview the actual options to manipulate the altered microbiota, such as modified diet, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal transplantation. Future possible therapies are also included. Targeting altered microbiota could be the next therapeutic personalized approach, but more research and well-designed comparative prospective studies are required to formulate adequate directions for prevention and therapy.},

The aim of this study was to determine the role of adiposity on bone mass in the first 3 y of diagnosis of IBD. The expected result is that increased adiposity will be associated with increased bone mass in both the controls and IBD subjects. METHODS: Height-adjusted bone mineral density (BMD) z-scores of 25 subjects, age 13.97 +/- 2.70 y, diagnosed with IBD for <4 y were compared to 24 controls, age 13.65 +/- 2.60 y. Overweight was defined as BMI of >/=85th but <95th percentile, and obesity as BMI >/=95th percentile. Severity of IBD was determined by the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index and Lichtiger Colitis Activity Index. RESULTS: Before stratification by BMI criterion, height-adjusted BMD z-scores were not significantly lower in IBD subjects versus controls for both the femoral neck (-0.8 +/- 1.1 versus -0.06 +/- 1.1, P = 0.070) and lumbar vertebrae (-0.4 +/- 1.2 versus 0.2 +/- 1.2, P = 0.086). Following stratification, height-adjusted BMD z-scores were significantly lower in the overweight/obese IBD subjects versus overweight/obese controls for femoral neck (-0.9 +/- 0.9 versus 0.3 +/- 1.3, P = 0.032); and non-significantly lower for the lumbar spine z-score (-0.4 +/- 1.6 versus 0.5 +/- 1.3, P = 0.197). BMD z-score had no relationship with the duration of disease, steroid therapy, and the severity of disease. CONCLUSION: Adiposity was associated with reduced bone mass in the early phases of IBD, but with increased bone mass in the controls.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systemic corticosteroids (CS) are a mainstay of treatment for patients with newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous population-based studies report CS exposure rates range from 39 to 75 % within the first year of diagnosis with surgical resection rates as high as 13-18 % in the same time frame. These reports represent an older cohort of patients enrolled over prolonged periods of time and do not necessarily reflect current treatment approaches. We examine CS use during the first year of IBD diagnosis in a community-based, inception cohort. METHODS: Data were derived from the Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry (OSCCAR), a prospective inception cohort of IBD patients who are residents of Rhode Island. RESULTS: A total of 272 patients were included in the current analyses. Overall, 60 % of Crohn's disease and 57 % of ulcerative colitis patients were exposed to at least one course of CS during year 1 of study enrollment. Most notably, only 2 % of patients (n = 5) required a surgical resection. CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based cohort, 59 % of patients were exposed to at least one course of CS during their first year of enrollment. In contrast to previous studies, OSCCAR represents a more modern cohort of patients. While steroid exposure rates were similar or slightly higher than those in previous reports, we observed a low rate of surgical resection. As our cohort ages, future analysis will focus on the role more contemporary agents may play on the low rates of surgery we observed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies describing the incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are uncommon in the United States. We sought to determine the incidence of CD and UC in the state of Rhode Island. METHODS: The Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry is a state-based inception cohort of patients newly diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Rhode Island. To confirm a diagnosis of CD, UC, or IBD unclassified (IBDU), the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases IBD Genetics Consortium criteria were applied in a review of medical records from gastroenterology practices located in the state of Rhode Island and adjacent to the Rhode Island border in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Using population-based data, we determined the statewide incidence of IBD in Rhode Island from 2008 to 2010. RESULTS: A total of 971 Rhode Island residents were diagnosed with IBD, including 444 with CD, 486 with UC, and 41 with IBD unclassified from 2008 to 2010. The overall age- and sex-adjusted IBD incidence was 30.2 (95% confidence interval, 28.3-32.1) per 100,000 persons in this time frame with 13.9, 15.1, and 1.3 per 100,000 diagnosed with CD, UC, and IBD unclassified, respectively. Of the total incident cases in Rhode Island, 30% (n = 291) were enrolled in Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry for follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IBD in Rhode Island is higher than that previously reported by other population-based cohorts in the United States. Prospective follow-up of individuals enrolled in the community-based Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry cohort is ongoing.},

It has been proposed that Vitamin D supplementation may have a beneficial role in IBD. AIM: To characterize the effects of Vitamin D on cathelicidin (hCAP/LL37) gene expression, ESR, and serum hs-CRP levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety UC patients on remission were randomized to receive 300,000 IU intramuscular Vitamin D or 1 mL normal saline as placebo, respectively. Before and 90 days after intervention, serum levels of 25 (OH)-Vitamin D3, PTH, Calcium, ESR, and hs-CRP were measured. Cathelicidin gene expression was also quantified using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Baseline serum 25-OH-Vitamin D3 levels were not different between the two groups and after intervention, increased only in Vitamin D group (P < 0.001). Hs-CRP levels were lower in Vitamin D group after intervention (Before: 3.43 +/- 3.47 vs 3.86 +/- 3.55 mg/L, P = 0.56; after: 2.31 +/- 2.25 vs 3.90 +/- 3.97 mg/L, P= 0.023).

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adalimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG1kappa) to tumor necrosis factor, has shown benefit in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and the serum concentration-efficacy relationship of adalimumab in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. METHODS: The safety, efficacy, and PK of adalimumab was evaluated in a phase-3, randomized, double-blind, 52-week study (IMAgINE-1, N = 192), which had a 4-week open-label induction phase (dose was determined by patient weight) followed by a 48-week double-blind maintenance phase (standard and low-dose arms, drug given every other week). Trough serum adalimumab (baseline, weeks 2, 4, 16, 26, and 52) and anti-adalimumab antibody measurements (baseline, weeks 16, 26, and 52) were collected. Disease activity was assessed using the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index. RESULTS: At week 52, adalimumab trough concentrations (mean +/- SD) were higher for patients in the standard-dose (9.48 +/- 5.61 mug/mL) compared with the low-dose (3.51 +/- 2.21 mug/mL) arm. In patients whose doses were increased from every other week to weekly, higher trough concentrations were observed after dose escalation. Higher body weight, baseline C-reactive protein, and lower baseline albumin levels were associated with greater clearance of adalimumab. An exposure (serum concentration)-efficacy relationship was observed, in which higher concentrations of adalimumab were associated with greater rates of remission. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to describe the PK of adalimumab in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. A positive association between serum adalimumab concentration and remission/response was identified.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) is a novel imaging modality that enables virtual optical biopsy in vivo. Loss of barrier function of the small bowel observed via pCLE as increased density of epithelial gaps (extrusion zones left in the intestinal lining after cells are shed) is predictive of relapse in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aims to determine whether such observations on pCLE are similarly predictive of disease relapse in pediatric patients with IBD. METHODS: Pediatric patients with biopsy-proven IBD underwent pCLE during colonoscopy and subsequent clinical follow-up every 6 months. Relapse was defined as moderate to severe flare with endoscopic evidence of inflammation during the follow-up period. The relations between epithelial gap density, disease relapse, and imaging parameters were determined using Cox models. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with IBD (13 with Crohn disease, 11 with ulcerative colitis) with a median age of 14 years (range 10-21) were studied for a median of 13 (4-33) months. The median duration of disease was 2.9 years (range 0-9). Increased epithelial gap density in the terminal ileum on pCLE of normal endoscopic appearing terminal ileum mucosa (N = 19) was predictive of disease relapse when 3 or more areas were imaged (N = 6, log-rank P = 0.02, C-statistic = 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients with IBD, barrier dysfunction observed on pCLE imaging of the small bowel was predictive of disease relapse.},

The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of stoss therapy on vitamin D levels during a period of 6 months in children with IBD and vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/L). METHODS: A retrospective chart review was undertaken, focusing upon children managed in the IBD clinic at Sydney Children's Hospital between 2006 and 2010. Those with a 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) level <50 nmol/L and those who received stoss therapy were included in this study. RESULTS: A total of 76 children received stoss therapy. There was a significant and sustained increase in 25-OHD levels at all of the time points compared with baseline (40.8 +/- 7.5 nmol/L), 1 month (145.6 +/- 51.8 nmol/L), 3 months (87.1 +/- 28.4 nmol/L), and 6 months 69.2 +/- 31.3 nmol/L). There were no significant changes in serum calcium, phosphate, or parathyroid hormone at any time points. CONCLUSIONS: Stoss therapy safely and effectively achieved and maintained a level of 25-OHD >50 nmol/L during 6 months in these children with IBD. Further prospective studies are now required to confirm this finding and establish whether this intervention has other benefits.},

   abstract = {OCTN1/SLC22A4 is expressed on apical membranes of small intestine, and is involved in gastrointestinal absorption of its substrates, including the food-derived antioxidant ergothioneine (ERGO). ERGO concentration in circulating blood of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease) is lower than that in healthy volunteers; thus, circulating ERGO is a potential diagnostic marker, although the mechanisms underlying low ERGO concentration in patients are unknown. Here, we focused on intestinal macrophages, which infiltrate sites of inflammation, and examined possible first-pass uptake of ERGO by macrophages. ERGO concentration in blood was lower in mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis than in controls. On the other hand, expression of octn1 gene product and ERGO concentration in intestinal tissues of DSS-treated mice were higher than in controls. Interestingly, lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) isolated from DSS-treated mice contained ERGO and showed [(3)H]ERGO uptake and Octn1 expression, whereas ERGO was undetectable in LPMCs of control mice. Functional expression of OCTN1 was also confirmed in LPS-stimulated human macrophage-like cell line, THP-1. In conclusion, OCTN1 is functionally expressed on activated intestinal macrophages, and ERGO uptake into these immune cells could contribute at least in part to the altered disposition of ERGO in intestinal inflammation.},

Decreased serum thiamine levels are often reported in patients with CD. Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a severe form of thiamine deficiency that can cause serious neurologic complications. Although WE is known to occur frequently in alcoholics, a number of non-alcoholic causes have also been reported. Here, we report two cases of non-alcoholic WE that developed in two severely malnourished CD patients who were supported by prolonged total parenteral nutrition without thiamine supplementation. These patients complained of sudden-onset ophthalmopathy, cerebellar dysfunction, and confusion. Magnetic resonance imaging allowed definitive diagnosis for WE despite poor sensitivity. The intravenous administration of thiamine alleviated the symptoms of WE dramatically. We emphasize the importance of thiamine supplementation for malnourished patients even if they are not alcoholics, especially in those with CD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) predominantly affects young adults. Fertility-related issues are therefore important in the management of patients with IBD. However, relatively modest attention has been paid to reproductive issues faced by men with IBD. To investigate the effects of IBD and its treatment on male fertility, we reviewed the current literature using a systematic search for published studies. A PubMed search were performed using the main search terms "IBD AND male infertility", "Crohn's disease AND male infertility", "ulcerative colitis AND male infertility". References in review articles were used if relevant. We noted that active inflammation, poor nutrition, alcohol use, smoking, medications, and surgery may cause infertility in men with IBD. In surgery such as proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, rectal incision seems to be associated with sexual dysfunction. Of the medications used for IBD, sulfasalazine reversibly reduces male fertility. No other medications appear to affect male fertility significantly, although small studies suggested some adverse effects. There are limited data on the effects of drugs for IBD on male fertility and pregnancy outcomes; however, patients should be informed of the possible effects of paternal drug exposure. This review provides information on fertility-related issues in men with IBD and discusses treatment options.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although several noninvasive and easily accessible biomarkers for inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] are available, their sensitivity and specificity are not adequate to be used as single markers and do not overrule the need for endoscopic evaluation. We previously reported that serum leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein [LRG] was a novel biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis and IBD. We herein investigated whether LRG could indicate endoscopic activity in patients with ulcerative colitis [UC]. METHODS: Serum LRG concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] in consecutive 129 patients with UC in two tertiary care hospitals, and associations of LRG with clinical and endoscopic activities were evaluated. Clinical activity index [CAI] < 6 was defined as clinical remission, and mucosal healing [MH] and complete mucosal healing were defined as Matts' endoscopic grades of 1 or 2 and grade of 1, respectively. RESULTS: Serum LRG levels were significantly increased and correlated with clinical and endoscopic activities in patients with UC. LRG levels were associated with both clinical and endoscopic activities even in patients with normal serum C-reactive protein [CRP] levels. Furthermore, LRG levels were significantly lower in patients with complete MH and deep remission. Serial measurements of LRG levels in a subset of patients demonstrated that LRG was significantly elevated during the endoscopically active stage compared with that during the MH stage. CONCLUSIONS: Serum LRG is a novel biomarker for detecting MH during disease course in patients with UC and a surrogate marker of endoscopic inflammation in patients with normal CRP levels.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Substance P (SP), neurokinin-1 receptors (NK-1Rs) are expressed in mesenteric preadipocytes and SP binding activates proinflammatory signalling in these cells. We evaluated the expression levels of SP (Tac-1), NK-1R (Tacr-1), and NK-2R (Tacr-2) mRNA in preadipocytes isolated from patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and examined their responsiveness to SP compared to control human mesenteric preadipocytes. The Aim of our study is to investigate the effects of the neuropeptide SP on cytokine expression in preadipocytes of IBD vs control patients and evaluate the potential effects of these cells on IBD pathophysiology via SP-NK-R interactions. METHODS: Mesenteric fat was collected from control, Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients (n=10-11 per group). Preadipocytes were isolated, expanded in culture and exposed to substance P. Colon biopsies were obtained from control and IBD patients. RESULTS: Tacr-1 and -2 mRNA were increased in IBD preadipocytes compared to controls, while Tac-1 mRNA was increased only in UC preadipocytes. SP differentially regulated the expression of inflammatory mediators in IBD preadipocytes compared to controls. Disease-dependent responses to SP were also observed between UC and CD preadipocytes. IL-17A mRNA expression and release increased after SP treatment in both CD and UC preadipocytes, while IL-17RA mRNA increased in colon biopsies from IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Preadipocyte SP-NK-1R interactions during IBD may participate in IBD pathophysiology. The ability of human preadipocytes to release IL-17A in response to SP together with increased IL-17A receptor in IBD colon opens the possibility of a fat-colonic mucosa inflammatory loop that may be active during IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The growing incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children necessitates the use of biological treatments. Recently, an infliximab biosimilar was authorized in the European Union, which may result in switching patients. We present our preliminary experiences with such switches. METHODS: The prospective study included 32 paediatric patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) and 7 children with ulcerative colitis (UC) at 3 academic hospitals, who were switched from infliximab originator to its biosimilar (Remsima). Patient characteristics, disease severity, laboratory parameters and adverse events were recorded. Means, medians and ranges were calculated. RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis of CD and UC was 11.1 (2.7-15.3) and 12.3 years (8.5-14.8), respectively. Mean number of infliximab originator infusions before switching to the biosimilar was 9.9 (median 8, range 4-29) and 5.1 (5, 1-12) for the CD and UC group, respectively. Evaluation efficacy of last biosimilar doses of all patients revealed rates of clinical remission of 88 and 57% for CD and UC patients, respectively. Last follow-up assessment of patients who continued with biosimilar therapy showed that 16/20 (80%) CD patients and all 4 UC individuals were in remission. One infusion reaction to infliximab biosimilar was observed in a CD patient, which led to treatment discontinuation. The incidence of sporadic mild adverse events prior to and after switching did not differ significantly and was consistent with the safety profile of the infliximab molecule. CONCLUSION: Switching from infliximab originator to its biosimilar seems to be a safe option in children with CD. After the switch the biosimilar was just as effective as the originator.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), can result in significant morbidity requiring frequent health care utilization. Although it is known that the overall financial impact of pediatric IBD is significant, the direct out-of-pocket (OOP) cost burden on the parents of children with IBD has not been explored. We hypothesized that affected children with a more relapsing disease course and families in lower income strata, ineligible for need-based assistance programs, disparately absorb ongoing financial stress. METHODS: We completed a cross-sectional analysis among parents of children with IBD residing in California using an online HIPAA-secure Qualtrics survey. Multicenter recruitment occurred between December 4, 2013 and September 18, 2014 at the point-of-care from site investigators, informational flyers distributed at regional CCFA conferences, and social media campaigns equally targeting Northern, Central, and Southern California. IBD-, patient-, and family-specific information were collected from the parents of pediatric patients with IBD patients younger than 18 years of age at time of study, carry a confirmed diagnosis of CD or UC, reside in and receive pediatric gastroenterology care in California, and do not have other chronic diseases requiring ongoing medical care. RESULTS: We collected 150 unique surveys from parents of children with IBD (67 CD; 83 UC). The median patient age was 14 years for both CD and UC, with an overall 3.7 years (SD 2.8 yr) difference between survey completion and time of IBD diagnosis. Annually, 63.6%, 28.6%, and 5.3% of families had an OOP cost burden >$500, >$1000, and >5000, respectively. Approximately one-third (36.0%) of patients had emergency department (ED) visits over the past year, with 59.2% of these patients spending >$500 on emergency department copays, including 11.1% who spent >$5000. Although 43.3% contributed <$500 on procedure and test costs, 20.0% spent >$2000 in the past year. Families with household income between $50,000 and $100,000 had a statistically significant probability (80.6%) of higher annual OOP costs than families with lower income <$50,000 (20.0%; P < 0.0001) or higher income >$100,000 (64.6%; P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that clinical variables associated with uncontrolled IBD states correlated to higher OOP cost burden. Annual OOP costs were more likely to be >$500 among patients who had increased spending on procedures and tests (odds ratio [OR], 5.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.73-11.63), prednisone course required over the past year (OR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.02-9.92), at least 1 emergency department visit for IBD symptoms (OR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.33-6.06), at least 4 or more outpatient primary medical doctor visits for IBD symptoms (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.40-5.68), and history of 4 or more lifetime hospitalizations for acute IBD care (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.13-5.96). CONCLUSIONS: Previously undocumented, a high proportion of pediatric IBD families incur substantial OOP cost burden. Patients who are frequently in relapsing and uncontrolled IBD states require more acute care services and sustain higher OOP cost burden. Lower middle income parents of children with IBD ineligible for need-based assistance may be particularly at risk for financial stress from OOP costs related to ongoing medical care.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), as well as intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) from Asia, are underreported. We, therefore, describe the prevalence of EIMs in Indian IBD and ITB patients and study their relationship with disease extent and severity in IBD. METHODS: This retrospective single-center study included all IBD and ITB patients evaluated from January 2005 to July 2012. Disease profile and frequencies of arthropathies (peripheral and central) and ocular (episcleritis, iritis/uveitis), oral (aphthous stomatitis), skin (erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, psoriasis), hepatobiliary (primary sclerosing cholangitis), and thromboembolic manifestations were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1,652 patients (1146 UC, 303 CD, 203 ITB), frequency of any EIM was 33.2 %, 38.3 %, and 14.3 % in UC, CD, and ITB patients, respectively. Thromboembolism was more common among UC patients with pancolitis than proctitis (p < 0.001) and left-sided colitis (p = 0.02). Primary sclerosing cholangitis was seen in 0.4 % UC patients. Steroid-dependent UC patients had higher frequency of any EIM, peripheral arthropathy, or thromboembolism than patients with no or infrequent steroid requirement (p < 0.05). Peripheral arthropathy (p = 0.02), erythema nodosum (p = 0.01), and aphthous stomatitis (p = 0.004) were more common with CD than with UC patients. Patients with colonic CD had higher frequency of peripheral arthropathy, any EIM, and multiple EIMs than ileal or ileocolonic disease (p < 0.05). Relative to ITB, CD patients had higher frequencies of peripheral arthropathy (p < 0.001), aphthous stomatitis (p = 0.01), any EIM (p < 0.001), and multiple EIMs (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In Indian IBD and ITB patients, EIMs appear to be related to disease severity in UC and disease location in CD and are significantly more common in CD than in ITB. Overall prevalence of EIMs in these patients is similar to that of the West.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Natalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody inhibiting lymphocyte migration and prescribed in patients with Crohn disease (CD) failing anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies. Because of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in patients with John Cunningham virus (JCV) positive, natalizumab is not widely used in clinical practice. Published experience of the use of natalizumab in pediatric patients is lacking. We aimed to describe the experience of natalizumab in patients with CD, including those who are JCV positive, at a tertiary care pediatric inflammatory bowel disease center. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed in patients with CD <21 years receiving natalizumab therapy before March 2014. Patient and disease information, prior treatments and response to natalizumab, including Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI), were recorded. Descriptive statistics were computed. RESULTS: Nine patients received natalizumab with a median age at diagnosis of 10 (range 7-16) years and median disease duration 72 (range 13-156) months. All of the patients had failed at least 1 anti-TNF agent. At baseline, the median HBI was 8 (IQR 6.5-11). By week 10, the median HBI was 4.5 (IQR 2-6), with 4 of 8 (50%) patients with CD being in remission. Forty-four percent (4/9) of patients were JCV antibody positive at baseline and had anti-JCV antibody index >0.9 (median 3.36). There were no serious adverse events, including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. All of the patients were transitioned to vedolizumab. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, natalizumab is a safe and efficacious medication in pediatric in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Given the favorable results with natalizumab, pediatric studies with the more gut targeted anti-integrin agent vedolizumab are warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Though vedolizumab has received regulatory approval for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults, there is increasing off-label use in children. AIMS: To describe the experience with vedolizumab in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients at 3 tertiary IBD centers and examine predictors of remission. METHODS: A retrospective review identified pediatric IBD patients (age < 18 yrs) receiving vedolizumab. Data on demographics, disease behavior, location, activity, and previous treatments/surgeries were collected. Disease activity was assessed using the weighted pediatric CD activity index or pediatric UC activity index. Primary outcome was week 14 remission, defined as pediatric UC activity index <10 or weighted pediatric CD activity index <12.5. Descriptive statistics and univariate analyses were performed to examine associations of clinical characteristics with efficacy. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients, 58% CD and 42% UC, initiated vedolizumab between June 2014 and August 2015. Median age at vedolizumab initiation was 14.9 (range 7-17) years. Ninety percent had failed >/=1 anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent. Week 14 remission rates for UC and CD were 76% and 42%, respectively (P < 0.05). Eighty percent of anti-TNF-naive patients experienced week 14 remission. At week 22, anti-TNF-naive patients had higher remission rates than TNF-exposed patients (100% versus 45%, P = 0.04). There were no infusion reactions or serious adverse events/infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that vedolizumab is efficacious and safe in pediatric IBD patients, with UC patients experiencing earlier and higher rates of remission than CD patients. Anti-TNF-naive patients experienced higher remission rates than those with anti-TNF exposure. Controlled clinical trial data are needed to confirm these observations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis is frequently treated with total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis reconstruction. Causes of pouch failure and criteria for improved patient selection remain poorly understood. We aimed to identify risk factors for pouch failure. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients in a prospectively maintained database. Consecutive patients undergoing ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for inflammatory bowel disease between 2000 and 2010 at our institution were included. The primary outcome was pouch failure, defined as permanent ostomy diversion or pouch excision. RESULTS: Of 417 total patients, 28 (6.7%) patients developed pouch failure. Pouch failure was associated with female gender, anastomotic leak, Crohn's disease of the pouch and preoperative Clostridium difficile colitis. The use of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha biologics was not associated with pouch failure. Notably, 14.9% of patients were diagnosed with preoperative C. difficile colitis, a factor independently associated with pouch failure (hazard ratio 3.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-7.44; P = 0.016). C. difficile colitis did not contribute to failure by increasing the incidence of anastomotic leak but was associated with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease of the pouch (adjusted hazard ratio 2.27 [1.08-4.79]; P = 0.031). Anastomotic leak (P < 0.001) and pelvic abscess requiring drainage (P = 0.031) were other independent risk factors for pouch failure. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to previously known risk factors, history of preoperative C. difficile colitis was associated with pouch failure after reconstruction, suggesting the need for further study into the role of the gut-associated microbiome in pouch outcomes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Gastric pathology and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection among Asian patients with Crohn's disease (CD) are still unclear. We evaluated gastric histologic features and frequency of H. pylori infection in Korean patients with CD. METHODS: Among 492 patients with CD receiving upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic evaluation in 19 Korean hospitals, we evaluated the endoscopic findings and gastric histopathologic features of 47 patients for our study. Histopathologic classification was performed using gastric biopsy tissues, and H. pylori infection was determined using the rapid urease test and histology. RESULTS: There were 36 men (76.6%), and the median age of patients at the time of upper GI endoscopy was 23.8 years (range, 14.2-60.5). For CD phenotype, ileocolonic disease was observed in 38 patients (80.9%), and non-stricturing, non-penetrating disease in 31 patients (66.0%). Twenty-eight patients (59.6%) complained of upper GI symptoms. Erosive gastritis was the most common gross gastric feature (66.0%). Histopathologically, H. pylori-negative chronic active gastritis (38.3%) was the most frequent finding. H. pylori testing was positive in 11 patients (23.4%), and gastric noncaseating granulomata were detected in 4 patients (8.5%). Gastric noncaseating granuloma showed a statistically significant association with perianal abscess/fistula (P=0.0496). CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori-negative chronic active gastritis appears to be frequent among Korean patients with CD. The frequency of H. pylori infection was comparable with previous studies. An association with perianal complications suggests a prognostic value for gastric noncaseating granuloma in patients with CD.},

METHODS: Vitamin A nutritional status was measured by serum retinol obtained by high performance liquid chromatography and the RDR test for evaluation of the hepatic stores. Body composition was performed by densitometry by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Vitamin A dietary intake was assessed from a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: This study included 38 CD patients and 33 controls. Low serum retinol concentrations were detected in 29% of CD patients vs 15% in controls (P < 0.005). The RDR test was positive in 37% of CD patients vs 12% in controls, which indicated inadequate hepatic vitamin A stores (P < 0.005). Individuals with hypovitaminosis A had lower BMI and body fat compared with those without this deficiency. There was no association between vitamin A deficiency and its dietary intake, ileal location, presence of disease activity and prior bowel resections. CONCLUSION: Patients with CD have higher prevalence of vitamin A deficiency, as assessed by two independent methods.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a serious global epidemic associated with a modern lifestyle. OBJECTIVE: Although aberrant interactions between gut microbes and the intestinal immune system have been implicated in this skin disease, the nature of the microbiome dysfunction underlying the disease remains unclear. METHODS: The gut microbiome from 132 subjects, including 90 patients with AD, was analyzed by using 16S rRNA gene and metagenome sequence analyses. Reference genomes from the Human Microbiome Project and the KEGG Orthology database were used for metagenome analyses. Short-chain fatty acids in fecal samples were compared by using gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analyses. RESULTS: We show that enrichment of a subspecies of the major gut species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is strongly associated with AD. In addition, the AD microbiome was enriched in genes encoding the use of various nutrients that could be released from damaged gut epithelium, reflecting a bloom of auxotrophic bacteria. Fecal samples from patients with AD showed decreased levels of butyrate and propionate, which have anti-inflammatory effects. This is likely a consequence of an intraspecies compositional change in F prausnitzii that reduces the number of high butyrate and propionate producers, including those related to the strain A2-165, a lack of which has been implicated in patients with Crohn disease. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that feedback interactions between dysbiosis in F prausnitzii and dysregulation of gut epithelial inflammation might underlie the chronic progression of AD by resulting in impairment of the gut epithelial barrier, which ultimately leads to aberrant TH2-type immune responses to allergens in the skin.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in pediatric-onset Crohn's disease patients who had failed treatment with infliximab. METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients included were those who had been diagnosed with Crohn's disease before 18 years old, and had received treatment with adalimumab after infliximab failure. The efficacy of adalimumab treatment was investigated at 1 month and 1 year, and adverse events that had occurred during treatment with adalimumab were explored. RESULTS: Ten patients were included in this study. The median duration from diagnosis to adalimumab treatment was 5.5 years (range: 2.4-7.9 years). At 1 month after adalimumab initiation, 80% (8/10) of patients showed clinical response, and 40% (4/10) achieved clinical remission. At 1 year, 71% (5/7) of patients showed clinical response, and 43% (3/7) were under clinical remission. Among the total included patients, 5 patients (50%) showed clinical response at 1 year. Primary non-response to adalimumab was observed in 2 patients (20%), and secondary failure to adalimumab was observed in 3 patients (30%) during 1 year treatment with adalimumab. No serious adverse event had occurred during adalimumab treatment. CONCLUSION: Adalimumab was effective for 1 year without serious adverse events in half of pediatric-onset Crohn's disease patients who had failed treatment with infliximab.},

   abstract = {Loss-of-function variants within the gene locus encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) are associated with increased risk for Crohn's disease (CD). A disturbed regulation of T helper (Th) cell responses causing loss of tolerance against self- or commensal-derived antigens and an altered intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in CD pathogenesis. Loss of PTPN2 in the T-cell compartment causes enhanced induction of Th1 and Th17 cells, but impaired induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several mouse colitis models, namely acute and chronic dextran sodium sulfate colitis, and T-cell transfer colitis models. This results in increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis which is comparable with that observed in CD patients. We detected inflammatory infiltrates in liver, kidney, and skin and elevated autoantibody levels indicating systemic loss of tolerance in PTPN2-deficient animals. CD patients featuring a loss-of-function PTPN2 variant exhibit enhanced Th1 and Th17 cell, but reduced Treg markers when compared with PTPN2 wild-type patients in serum and intestinal tissue samples. Our data demonstrate that dysfunction of PTPN2 results in aberrant T-cell differentiation and intestinal dysbiosis similar to those observed in human CD. Our findings indicate a novel and crucial role for PTPN2 in chronic intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intestinal fibrosis is mainly associated with Crohn's disease and is defined as a progressive and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components. No specific antifibrotic therapies are available. In this study, we evaluate the antifibrotic effect of a novel 5-ASA analog able to activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, named GED-0507-34 Levo. METHODS: Colonic fibrosis was induced in 110 C57BL/6 mice by 3 cycles of 2.5% (wt/vol) dextran sulfate sodium administration for 6 weeks. The preventive effects of oral daily GED (30 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1)) administration were evaluated using a macroscopic and histological score and also through biological endpoints. Expression of main markers of myofibroblasts activation was determined in transforming growth factor (TGF-beta)-stimulated intestinal fibroblasts and epithelial cells. RESULTS: GED improved macroscopic and microscopic intestinal lesions in dextran sulfate sodium-treated animals and reduced the profibrotic gene expression of Acta2, COL1a1, and Fn1 by 1.48-folds (P < 0.05), 1.93-folds (P < 0.005), and 1.03-fold (P < 0.05), respectively. It reduced protein levels of main markers of fibrosis (alpha-SMA and Collagen I-II) and the main TGF-beta/Smad pathway components. GED also decreased the interleukin-13 and connective tissue growth factor expression by 1.89-folds (P < 0.05) and 2.2-folds (P < 0.005), respectively. GED inhibited TGF-beta-induced activation of both fibroblast and intestinal epithelial cell lines, by regulating mRNA expression of alpha-SMA and fibronectin, and restoring the TGF-beta-induced loss of intestinal epithelial cell markers. GED treatment also reduced the TGF-beta and ACTA1 expression in primary human intestinal fibroblasts from ulcerative colitis patients. CONCLUSIONS: GED ameliorates intestinal fibrosis in dextran sulfate sodium-induced chronic colitis in mice and regulates major profibrotic cellular and molecular mechanisms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cutaneous manifestations are common in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) (ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]). Previous case reports described patients with IBD who developed rosacea. IBD and rosacea are inflammatory epithelial diseases, presumably associated with changes in the innate immune system. We explored the association between IBD and incident rosacea. METHODS: We conducted a population-based matched (1:1) case-control analysis on the association between IBD and rosacea, stratified by IBD disease duration and severity. We used data from the UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Cases had an incident diagnosis of rosacea recorded between 1995 and 2013. RESULTS: Among 80,957 rosacea cases and the same number of controls, a history of UC was associated with an increased risk of rosacea (odds ratio [OR] 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-1.90), with the highest OR in those with short UC duration (OR 2.85, 95% confidence interval, 1.80-4.50 for patients with <2 years of disease history). A history of CD yielded an overall OR of 1.49 (95% CI, 1.25-1.77), which did not correlate with disease duration. Additional analyses on IBD disease severity yielded evidence for a higher risk of rosacea in those with higher UC and CD activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that patients with IBD may be at increased risk of rosacea (higher in UC), particularly during phases of increased IBD-associated gastrointestinal tract inflammation.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There are data suggesting that the diagnostic usefulness of faecal calprotectin (FC) may vary depending on the Crohn's disease (CD) location. The aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic usefulness of FC in CD patients with different disease locations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 120 CD patients in the study. Disease activity was assessed by using Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), biochemical markers, and endoscopic and radiographic methods. Faecal calprotectin concentration was assessed in single stool samples by using the ELISA method. RESULTS: Among all patients, 54 (45%) had ileocolonic CD location, 44 (36.5%) had isolated small bowel location, and 22 (18.5%) had colonic CD location. FC correlated significantly with C-reactive protein concentration and endoscopic and radiographic activity among patients with isolated small bowel CD (p = 0.03, r = 0.32; p < 0.0001, r = 0.78; p = 0.03, r = 0.35; respectively) and with C-reactive protein and endoscopic activity in isolated colonic CD (p = 0.0009, r = 0.7; p = 0.0002, r = 0.78; respectively). CDAI and inflammatory biochemical markers did not correlate with endoscopic and radiographic assessment in small bowel CD. In patients with ileocolonic CD, FC correlated significantly with endoscopy (p = 0.006, r = 0.5), radiographic assessment (p = 0.04, r = 0.3), CDAI (p = 0.0006, r = 0.5) and the majority of biochemical markers. CONCLUSIONS: Faecal calprotectin is a useful diagnostic marker in all CD patients. Although its usefulness in small bowel CD seems to be the lowest, it should be utilized particularly in this disease location because of the lack of other reliable, non-invasive diagnostic methods.},

   abstract = {The healthy human intestine is colonized by as many as 1014 bacteria belonging to more than 500 different species forming a microbial ecosystem of unsurpassed diversity, termed the microbiota. The microbiota's various bacterial members engage in a physiological network of cooperation and competition within several layers of complexity. Within the last 10 years, technological progress in the field of next-generation sequencing technologies has tremendously advanced our understanding of the wide variety of physiological and pathological processes that are influenced by the commensal microbiota (1, 2). An increasing number of human disease conditions, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), type 2 diabetes, obesity, allergies and colorectal cancer are linked with altered microbiota composition (3). Moreover, a clearer picture is emerging of the composition of the human microbiota in healthy individuals, its variability over time and between different persons and how the microbiota is shaped by environmental factors (i.e., diet) and the host's genetic background (4). A general feature of a normal, healthy gut microbiota can generate conditions in the gut that disfavor colonization of enteric pathogens. This is termed colonization-resistance (CR). Upon disturbance of the microbiota, CR can be transiently disrupted, and pathogens can gain the opportunity to grow to high levels. This disruption can be caused by exposure to antibiotics (5, 6), changes in diet (7, 8), application of probiotics and drugs (9), and a variety of diseases (3). Breakdown of CR can boost colonization by intrinsic pathogens or increase susceptibility to infections (10). One consequence of pathogen expansion is the triggering of inflammatory host responses and pathogen-mediated disease. Interestingly, human enteric pathogens are part of a small group of bacterial families that belong to the Proteobacteria: the Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, Yersinia spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp.), the Vibrionaceae (Vibrio cholerae) and the Campylobacteriaceae (Campylobacter spp.). In general, members of these families (be it commensals or pathogens) only constitute a minority of the intestinal microbiota. However, proteobacterial "blooms" are a characteristic trait of an abnormal microbiota such as in the course of antibiotic therapy, dietary changes or inflammation (11). It has become clear that the gut microbiota not only plays a major role in priming and regulating mucosal and systemic immunity, but that the immune system also contributes to host control over microbiota composition. These two ways of mutual communication between the microbiota and the immune system were coined as "outside-in" and "inside-out," respectively (12). The significance of those interactions for human health is particularly evident in Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). The symptoms of these recurrent, chronic types of gut inflammation are caused by an excessive immune response against one's own commensal microbiota (13). It is assumed that deregulated immune responses can be caused by a genetic predisposition, leading to, for example, the impairment of intestinal barrier function or disruption of mucosal T-cell homeostasis. In CD or UC patients, an abnormally composed microbiota, referred to as "dysbiosis," is commonly observed (discussed later). This is often characterized by an increased relative abundance of facultative anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Enterobacteriaeceae, Bacilli) and, at the same time, depletion of obligate anaerobic bacteria of the classes Bacteroidia and Clostridia. So far, it is unclear whether dysbiosis is a cause or a consequence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In fact, both scenarios are equally conceivable. Recent work suggests that inflammatory immune responses in the gut (both IBD and pathogen-induced) can alter the gut luminal milieu in a way that favors dysbiosis (14). In this chapter, I present a survey on our current state of understanding of the characteristics and mechanisms underlying gut inflammation-associated dysbiosis. The role of dysbiosis in enteric infections and human IBD is discussed. In addition, I will focus on competition of enteric pathogens and the gut microbiota in the inflamed gut and the role of dysbiotic microbiota alterations (e.g., "Enterobacterial blooms" (11)) for the evolution of pathogenicity.},

Why these associations are observed remains unclear. We assessed the impact of geographic location, season, and exposure to ultraviolet light on disease severity by measuring national hospital IBD-related discharge rates. METHODS: Utilizing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), we identified all patients with IBD-related discharges from 2001-2007. Patients were included if they were discharged from states above the 40th parallel (north) or at or below the 35th parallel (south); and their discharge fell within the winter (January, February, and March) or summer (July, August, and September). Groups of patients were assessed comparing north to south within each season, and summer to winter within each region. UV index was recorded from the National Weather Service data and compared to monthly discharge rates. RESULTS: There was a consistent pattern of increased IBD-related hospitalization rates in northern states compared to southern states for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Differences in IBD-related hospitalization rates by season, however, were not uniform across the years studied. UV index was significantly inversely associated although not proportional to discharge rates for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: In the US, there is a significant increased rate of IBD-related hospitalizations in the northern compared to southern states, which not fully explained by differences in UV exposure.},

   abstract = {Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with a number of pathological gastrointestinal conditions other than inflammatory bowel disease, and also with liver disorders. Different factors such as chronic bleeding, malabsorption and inflammation may contribute to IDA. Although patients with symptoms of anemia are frequently referred to gastroenterologists, the approach to diagnosis and selection of treatment as well as follow-up measures is not standardized and suboptimal. Iron deficiency, even without anemia, can substantially impact physical and cognitive function and reduce quality of life. Therefore, regular iron status assessment and awareness of the clinical consequences of impaired iron status are critical. While the range of options for treatment of IDA is increasing due to the availability of effective and well-tolerated parenteral iron preparations, a comprehensive overview of IDA and its therapy in patients with gastrointestinal conditions is currently lacking. Furthermore, definitions and assessment of iron status lack harmonization and there is a paucity of expert guidelines on this topic. This review summarizes current thinking concerning IDA as a common co-morbidity in specific gastrointestinal and liver disorders, and thus encourages a more unified treatment approach to anemia and iron deficiency, while offering gastroenterologists guidance on treatment options for IDA in everyday clinical practice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serum infliximab (s-IFX) levels, antibodies to IFX (ATI), and inflammatory markers are important in predicting clinical outcomes in adults, but their roles in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) require further study. The primary aim of this study was to determine the association between serologic parameters during induction and ongoing IFX therapy at 12 months in pediatric CD. METHODS: S-IFX, ATI, serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (s-TNF-alpha), and C-reactive protein were measured at IFX initiation, 10 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months in a prospective cohort study of children with CD at a single tertiary care center. RESULTS: At 12 months, 60 of 77 participants (78%) remained on IFX. Participants who completed 12 months of IFX had higher 10-week median s-IFX levels (20.40 mug/mL; interquartile range [IQR], 11.20-35.00] versus 8.70 mug/mL; IQR 0.90-16.90; P = 0.01), a greater proportion with undetectable 10-week ATI (P = 0.008), and a greater median change in s-TNF-alpha between baseline and week 10 (-5.96 pg/mL; IQR, -8.73 to -4.17 versus -1.76 pg/mL; IQR, -5.60 to 0.30; P = 0.006). Receiver operating characteristic analysis to predict ongoing IFX at 12 months showed area under the curve (95% confidence interval) for 10-week s-IFX and change in s-TNF-alpha from baseline to 10 weeks to be 0.71 (0.54-0.88) and 0.74 (0.58-0.91), respectively. C-reactive protein was not associated with ongoing therapy. CONCLUSIONS: ATI, s-IFX, and s-TNF-alpha during IFX induction are associated with 12-month clinical outcomes in pediatric CD. Future studies are needed to further define the clinical role of s-TNF-alpha measurement and to compare the clinical utility of 10 and 14-week ATI and s-IFX levels.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Crohn's disease (CD) is a refractory inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology, frequently complicated by malnutrition. It is thought that the delayed wound healing associated with this malnutrition in CD patients might adversely affect the therapeutic benefits of infliximab (IFX). Therefore, we investigated the effects of nutritional status on IFX treatment. METHODS: We assessed nutritional status and CD activity when IFX therapy was initiated and following the third dose, 6 weeks later. Nutritional status was assessed using the body mass index (BMI) and nutritional risk index (NRI), whereas CD activity was assessed using the CD activity index (CDAI). RESULTS: All patients with a BMI >/= 18.5 kg/m(2) at the time of IFX therapy met the effective criteria for the CDAI, and IFX treatment was considered responsive in these patients. Furthermore, IFX treatment was responsive, with a high level of effectiveness, in all five subjects (31.3 %) with NRI scores of 97.5 and above with no risk of malnutrition (p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that nutritional status does influence the therapeutic effect of IFX in CD patients. The response rate to IFX treatment thus could be improved by optimizing the nutritional status. We recommend comprehensive nutritional assessment and intervention prior to IFX treatment schedules.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to identify areas for further development of clinical outcome assessment (COA) in pediatric Crohn disease (CD). METHODS: The study analyzed the measurement properties of all existing COA tools for pediatric CD in literature and published registration trials of approved drugs for pediatric CD based on criteria described in Food and Drug Administration guidance for patient-reported outcome (PRO) development. RESULTS: The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and its derivatives (abbreviated, short, modified, and weighted PCDAIs) were reviewed. The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI), designed for adult patients, have been adapted for use in a few pediatric CD studies. The use of PCDAI as an endpoint in Remicade and Humira trials led to the Food and Drug Administration-approved indication in pediatric CD. Common issues in measurement properties of COA tools included the absence of direct patient or caregivers' input to generate the items measuring signs and symptoms; absence of evidence demonstrating correlation with clinically relevant inflammation observed with endoscopic measures; lack of standardization in measurement, age-appropriate interviewer script, and response rating criteria for the physician interviewer. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence indicates that CDAI, HBI, and 5 versions of the PCDAI lack adequate measurement properties for use as a primary endpoint for phase 3 trials intended to support approval of products intended to treat pediatric CD. In order to facilitate pediatric drug development, a well-defined, reliable, sensitive, and globally recognized PRO that measures signs and symptoms in children with CD and that can be used in conjunction with endoscopy-based endpoints and/or biomarkers is sorely needed.},

   abstract = {Recently, numerous studies have shown that disruption of the mucus barrier plays an important role in the exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly in ulcerative colitis. Alterations in the mucus barrier are well supported by published data and are widely accepted. The use of fluorescence in situ hybridization and Carnoy's fixation has revealed the importance of the mucus barrier in maintaining a mutualistic relationship between host and bacteria. Studies have raised the possibility that modulation of the mucus barrier may provide therapies for the disease, using agents such as short-chain fatty acids, prebiotics and probiotics. This review describes changes in the mucus barrier of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in animal models of the disease. We also review the involvement of the mucus barrier in the exacerbation of the disease and explore the therapeutic potential of modifying the mucus barrier with short-chain fatty acids, prebiotics, probiotics, fatty acid synthase, H(2)S, neutrophil elastase inhibitor and phophatidyl choline.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an incurable chronic idiopathic disease that drastically decreases quality of life. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) is responsible for the clearance of misfolded proteins; however, its role in disease pathogenesis remains largely unexplored. Here we show that the expression of SEL1L and HRD1, the most conserved branch of mammalian ERAD, is significantly reduced in ileal Crohn's disease (CD). Consistent with this observation, laboratory mice with enterocyte-specific Sel1L deficiency (Sel1L(DeltaIEC)) develop spontaneous enteritis and have increased susceptibility to Toxoplasma gondii-induced ileitis. This is associated with profound defects in Paneth cells and a disproportionate increase of Ruminococcus gnavus, a mucolytic bacterium with known association with CD. Surprisingly, whereas both ER stress sensor IRE1alpha and effector CHOP are activated in the small intestine of Sel1L(DeltaIEC) mice, they are not solely responsible for ERAD deficiency-associated lesions seen in the small intestine. Thus our study points to a constitutive role of Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD in epithelial cell biology and the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation in CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that dietary therapy may be effective for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but limited published data exist on the usage and efficacy of dietary therapy. AIM: To evaluate the perspective of IBD patients using the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD). METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted using REDCap, a Web-based survey tool. Survey links were sent to known Web sites as well as support groups in an attempt to characterize patient utilization of the SCD and perception of efficacy of the SCD. RESULTS: There were 417 respondents of the online survey on the SCD with IBD. Mean age for individuals on the SCD was 34.9 +/- 16.4 years. Seventy percent were female. Forty-seven percent had Crohn's disease, 43 % had ulcerative colitis, and 10 % had indeterminate colitis. Individuals perceived clinical improvement on the SCD. Four percent reported clinical remission prior to the SCD, while 33 % reported remission at 2 months after initiation of the SCD, and 42 % at both 6 and 12 months. For those reporting clinical remission, 13 % reported time to achieve remission of less than 2 weeks, 17 % reported 2 weeks to a month, 36 % reported 1-3 months, and 34 % reported greater than 3 months. For individuals who reported reaching remission, 47 % of individuals reported associated improvement in abnormal laboratory values. CONCLUSIONS: The SCD is utilized by many patients as a primary and adjunct therapy for IBD. Most patients perceive clinical benefit to use of the SCD.},

Dysfunction of immunoregulatory factors and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may contribute to the damage of the gastrointestinal tract. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) are involved in protection of cells from the damaging effects of ROS. The aim of the study was to assess activity of antioxidative stress enzymes, GPx and SOD, in plasma and saliva of patients with active and inactive forms of CD. Forty-seven patients with CD were prospectively enrolled in the study. The control group comprised 25 healthy volunteers. Patients' demographics, clinical features, localization of inflammatory changes, CD history, and treatment were recorded. SOD and GPx were assayed in plasma and saliva samples by ELISA method. CD activity index (CDAI) scores correlated inversely with SOD in plasma (r = - 0.46; P = 0.0012), but not in saliva. No correlations were observed in respect to GPx activities in both plasma and saliva and CDAI. Higher activity of plasma SOD was observed in patients with inactive CD in comparison with active CD (P = 0.004). No significant differences in SOD and GPx activity both in plasma and saliva were found between CD remission group and the control group. We concluded that in active CD the antioxidant defence system was diminished and returned to normal values in remission. Results of SOD and GPx assays in saliva are not conclusive, suggesting that saliva seems to be not an appropriate material for further similar studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Relationships between inflammatory bowel disease and lactose containing foods remain controversial and poorly defined regarding symptoms, nutritional outcomes, and epidemiologic associations for lactose maldigestion. METHODS: A literature review was performed using Pub Med, Cochrane library and individual references, to extract data on lactose maldigestion prevalence in inflammatory bowel diseases. A meta-analysis was done using selected articles, to determine odds ratios of maldigestion. Information was collected about symptoms, impact on pattern of dairy food consumption, as well as the effects of dairy foods on the course of inflammatory bowel diseases. RESULTS: A total of 1022 articles were evaluated, 35 articles were retained and 5 studies were added from review articles. Of these 17 were included in meta-analysis which showed overall increased lactose maldigestion in both diseases. However increased risk on sub analysis was only found in Crohn's in patients with small bowel involvement. Nine additional studies were reviewed for symptoms, with variable outcomes due to confounding between lactose intolerance and lactose maldigestion. Fourteen studies were evaluated for dairy food effects. There was a suggestion that dairy foods may protect against inflammatory bowel disease. Nutritional consequences of dairy restrictions might impact adversely on bone and colonic complications. CONCLUSIONS: Lactose maldigestion in inflammatory bowel disease is dependent on ethnic makeup of the population and usually not disease. No bias of increased disease prevalence was noted between lactase genotypes. Intolerance symptoms depend on several parameters besides lactose maldigestion. Dairy foods may decrease risks of inflammatory bowel disease. Dairy restrictions may adversely affect disease outcome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: To determine the proportion of T-regulatory cells (CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ cells) in peripheral blood and the number of FOXP3+ cells in intestinal mucosa of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and to verify whether these parameters correlate with the activity of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 24 patients newly diagnosed for IBD were included in the study: ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 13) and Crohn's disease (CD; n = 11). Seventeen healthy controls (HC) and 16 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) served as a control group for peripheral and intestinal Tregs assessment, respectively. The disease activity was assessed by Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI). Quantification of regulatory T cells of CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ phenotype in peripheral blood was based on three-color flow cytometry. Mucosal Tregs represented by FOXP3+ cells were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Median proportion of CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ cells among CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood (5.1%, range 1.7-84% vs. 4.3%, range 2-8.1%, p = 0.023) and median number of intestinal FOXP3+ cells (115.33 per high-power field, hpf, range 39.33-375.67 vs. 10.16 per hpf, range 5-30, p = 0.0001) were significantly higher in children with IBD than in the controls. The proportion of circulating Tregs and the number of intestinal FOXP3+ cells did not correlate with clinical activity of the disease, as well as with endoscopic and histopathologic scoring. No significant correlation was found between the percentage of peripheral CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ cells and the number of intestinal FOXP3+cells. CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBD likely do not present with a quantitative deficiency of circulating and intestinal Tregs at the moment of diagnosis.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Deep remission, defined as clinical remission with mucosal healing (MH), with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha agents is a new target for therapy in Crohn's disease (CD). Provided that the efficacy of infliximab (IFX) for induction of MH in CD has been demonstrated, there are much less data for adalimumab (ADA), and none concerning MH on histopathological examination. AIM: To assess the impact of biological therapy with ADA on both endoscopic and histopathological MH in paediatric patients with CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three children (10 boys and 13 girls) aged 13.0 +/-9.3 years with moderate to severely active CD diagnosed at the mean age of 5.5 +/-0.83 years were included into the study. Seven (30.4%) patients had been previously treated with infliximab and switched to ADA due to intolerance or loss of response. Colonoscopy and gastroscopy with sample collection were performed in all patients before and after induction treatment with ADA. Clinical activity of the disease was assessed using the Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), and the endoscopic activity was scored using the Simple Endoscopic Score (SES-CD). Histological changes were evaluated by a self-adapted numerical scoring system. RESULTS: Four (17.4%) patients reached clinical remission (PCDAI </= 10). When comparing data at baseline and at a week after ADA treatment, a significant decrease was observed in median PCDAI and in SES-CD score between the initial and control colonoscopies. We reported a decrease in histological scale, which was not statistically significant. A correlation was found between PCDAI and SES-CD score. CONCLUSIONS: Biological therapy with ADA has a positive impact on endoscopic mucosal healing in paediatric patients with CD, which is not associated with histological evidence of suppression of inflammation. Endoscopic MH correlates better than microscopic one with clinical remission.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In recent years, monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), infliximab (IFX), and adalimumab (ADA) have gained increasing popularity in Crohn's disease (CD) management. Many clinical trials have shown that biologics are a generally well-tolerated and safe treatment. However, the follow-up time with regards to safety is too short, and data on that issue are still limited. AIM: To report the cumulative safety profile of biologic therapy with IFX and/or ADA, up to 8 years, in Polish children with moderately to severely active CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 110 children, aged 13.0 +/-9.3 years, diagnosed with CD, and treated with IFX and/or ADA, within a period of 8 years between 2005 and 2013. Safety data for all treated patients were collected throughout the entire treatment period and were included in the safety analyses. RESULTS: The cumulative rates of treatment-related adverse events (AE) (TRAEs) in all patients were 67 events - 43 (64.17%) events for IFX and 24 (35.83%) for ADA, respectively. The majority of TEAEs were mild-to-moderate in intensity. The most frequently reported ones were: anaemia in 17 (20.23%) IFX patients and 9 (23.08%) ADA patients, and mild infections in 9 (10.7%) IFX patients and 5 (12.8%) ADA patients, respectively. We did not report any serious AE (sAE). CONCLUSIONS: Biologic therapy with infliximab and/or adalimumab is generally well tolerated and safe, and does not cause any sAEs.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The clinical efficacy of infliximab (IFX) for induction of remission in both adults and children with active Crohn's disease (CD) has been well documented. Recently, so-called "deep remission" defined as mucosal healing has become the ultimate endpoint of the most recent therapeutic advances for CD. However, endoscopic evidence of mucosal healing is not necessarily associated with histological evidence of suppression of inflammation. AIM: Since data on that issue are limited, especially in the paediatric population, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of induction therapy with IFX on deep microscopic remission in paediatric patients with CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-six children (32 boys and 24 girls) aged 13.0 +/-9.3 years with moderate to severely active CD diagnosed at the mean age of 5.5 +/-0.83 years were included into the study. Colonoscopy and gastroscopy with sample collection were performed in all patients before and after three injections of IFX. Clinical activity of the disease was assessed using the Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), and the endoscopic activity was scored using the Simple Endoscopic Score (SES-CD). Histological changes were evaluated by a previously described numerical scoring system. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (69.6%) patients reached clinical remission (PCDAI </= 10). When comparing data at baseline and at week 10, a significant decrease was observed in median PCDAI, and in SES-CD score between the initial and control colonoscopies. We also reported a decrease in histological scale. However, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.63). Three (5.4%) patients had a score of zero in the control histological examination. The correlation was found only between histological score and SES-CD score. Clinical remission correlated better with mucosal healing expressed by a decrease in SES-CD score than with microscopic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Biological therapy with infliximab enables mucosal healing in paediatric patients with CD, which is not necessarily associated with histological evidence of suppression of inflammation. Mucosal healing correlates better than microscopic healing with clinical remission.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic condition of the colon and small intestine. The disease is common in young people (children and young adults), but it is rare in children younger than five years of age. Therefore, IBD developing during the first years of life (under the age of 5) is known as an early-onset IBD (EO-IBD), and it is considered to be a specific entity with a distinct phenotype. However, the available data on that issue are still insufficient. AIM: To determine the characteristics and clinical course of children with early-onset IBD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective database analysis of 47 infants younger than 5 years old diagnosed with IBD. Patient's demographic data, including age, sex, and age at disease onset, were collected in 6 paediatric hospitals in Poland. Disease location was established on the basis of the review of all endoscopic, colonoscopic, histopathological, and radiological records. All possible complications were reported, as well as any treatment and its efficacy. Since the diagnosis was established all patients have been on follow up. RESULTS: Among 47 children registered in the database, 23 (49%) had a diagnosis of CD, 16 (34%) had UC, and 8 (17%) had IC (indeterminate colitis). The mean age at diagnosis was 28.5 +/-27.5 months; 57.4% were male. The most common location/type of disease was ileocolonic disease (L3). The most common complication of IBD was anaemia, found in 30 (63.8%) children. The observed course of the disease was either severe or moderate. In 4 children younger than 2 years old, surgery was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory bowel disease in children younger than 5 years old includes UC, CD, and a relatively high proportion of IC. In early-onset IBD severe and moderate course of the disease is usually observed. Disease manifestation in these patients is predominantly ileocolonic.},

Twenty-two hospitalized patients with CD and 18 patients with UC were enrolled in this study. We analyzed nutritional status upon admission by using nutritional screening tools including subjective global assessment, malnutrition universal screening tool, and laboratory tests. We measured resting energy expenditure (mREE) of the patients with indirect calorimetry and predicted resting energy expenditure (pREE) was calculated by using the Harris-Benedict equation. Results presented here indicate no significant difference in nutritional parameters and energy metabolism between CD and UC patients. In UC patients, a significant correlation was observed between mREE/body weight and disease activity detected by the Lichtiger and Seo indices. However, there was no correlation between mREE/body weight and Crohn's disease activity index in CD patients. Inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 levels correlated with mREE/pREE in CD and UC patients while tumor necrosis factor-alpha was not. In conclusion, energy expenditure significantly correlated with disease activity in UC patients but not in CD patients. These results indicate that establishing daily energy requirements based on disease activity of UC is imperative for improving the nutritional status of patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been considerable progress in identifying inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] susceptibility genes but little progress in examining the role of genetic variation in the development of the extra-intestinal manifestations [EIMs] of IBD. This study identified clinical, serological, and genetic factors associated with ocular EIMs [O-EIMs] in IBD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case-control study of IBD patients, comparing those with and without O-EIMs using the Cedars-Sinai IBD Research Repository and the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium Repository. Genotyping was performed using Illumina whole genome platforms. RESULTS: In all, 124 cases and 3328 controls with available clinical data were identified; 103 cases and 2808 controls had genetic data available. Erythema nodosum and peripheral arthritis particularly were common in patients with O-EIMs [p = 2.77 x 10(-13) and p = 2.58 x 10(-13), respectively] with increasing odds ratios for O-EIMs with each additional non-ocular-EIM [for >/= 2 EIMs, odds ratio 14.72]. Nominal association with O-EIMs was observed at several known IBD susceptibility single nuclear polymorphisms. One locus, containing RBM19, achieved genome-wide level of significance for association with O-EIMs. CONCLUSIONS: In IBD, O-EIMs co-occur with musculoskeletal and skin manifestations and, in this study, are nominally associated with known IBD loci. Additional cohorts are needed to verify these results and identify additional genes.},

Adequate sampling strategies are required to limit bias due to shifts in microbial communities during sampling and storage. Therefore, we examined the impact of different sampling and storage conditions on the stability of fecal microbial communities in healthy and diseased subjects. Fecal samples from 10 healthy controls, 10 irritable bowel syndrome and 8 inflammatory bowel disease patients were collected on site, aliquoted immediately after defecation and stored at -80 degrees C, -20 degrees C for 1 week, at +4 degrees C or room temperature for 24 hours. Fecal transport swabs (FecalSwab, Copan) were collected and stored for 48-72 hours at room temperature. We used pyrosequencing of the 16S gene to investigate the stability of microbial communities. Alpha diversity did not differ between all storage methods and -80 degrees C, except for the fecal swabs. UPGMA clustering and principal coordinate analysis showed significant clustering by test subject (p < 0.001) but not by storage method. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and (un)weighted UniFrac showed a significant higher distance between fecal swabs and -80 degrees C versus the other methods and -80 degrees C samples (p < 0.009). The relative abundance of Ruminococcus and Enterobacteriaceae did not differ between the storage methods versus -80 degrees C, but was higher in fecal swabs (p < 0.05). Storage up to 24 hours (at +4 degrees C or room temperature) or freezing at -20 degrees C did not significantly alter the fecal microbial community structure compared to direct freezing of samples from healthy subjects and patients with gastrointestinal disorders.},

Clinical activity scores and non-invasive biochemical markers do not correlate well with mucosal inflammation. Microbial perturbations have been associated with disease activity in CD. Therefore, we aimed to investigate its potential use to differentiate CD patients in remission from those with an exacerbation. From 71 CD patients repeated fecal samples were collected, resulting in 97 active disease and 97 remission samples based on a combination of biochemical and clinical parameters. The microbiota composition was assessed by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA V1-V3 region. Random Forest analysis was used to find the most discriminatory panel of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between active and remission samples. An independent internal validation set was used to validate the model. A combination of 50 OTUs was able to correctly predict 73% of remission and 79% of active samples with an AUC of 0.82 (sensitivity: 0.79, specificity: 0.73). This study demonstrates that fecal microbial profiles can be used to differentiate between active and remission CD and underline the potential of the fecal microbiota as a non-invasive tool to monitor disease activity in CD.},

Bone mass deficits are well described, little is known about other body composition compartments. AIMS: To define the alterations in non-bone tissue compartments in children with IBD, and explore the effects of demographic and disease parameters. METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in the PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) and Web of Science databases in May 2014 (limitations age <17 years, and composition measurements compared with a defined control population). RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in this systematic review, reporting on a total of 1479 children with IBD [1123 Crohn's disease, 243 ulcerative colitis], pooled mean age 13.1 +/- 3.2 years, and 34.9% female. Data were highly heterogeneous, in terms of methodology and patients. Deficits in protein-related compartments were reported. Lean mass deficits were documented in 93.6% of Crohn's disease and 47.7% of ulcerative colitis patients when compared with healthy control populations. Lower lean mass was common to both sexes in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, deficits in females with persisted for longer. Fat-related compartment findings were inconsistent, some studies report reductions in body fat in new diagnosis/active Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that almost all children with Crohn's disease and half with ulcerative colitis have reduced lean mass, however, body fat alterations are not well defined. To understand what impact this may have on health and disease in children with IBD, further studies are needed to identify in which tissues these deficits lie, and to quantify body fat and its distribution.},

Two presentations explored different aspects of probiotic intervention: the small intestine as a probiotic target and inclusion of probiotics into integrative approaches to gastroenterology. Probiotic recommendations in gastroenterology guidelines and current data on probiotic efficacy in paediatric patients were reviewed. Updates were given on probiotic and gut microbiota research in obesity and obesity-related diseases, the gut-brain axis and development of psychobiotics, and the protective effects of equol-producing strains for prostate cancer. Recent studies were presented on probiotic benefit for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and people with HIV, as well as protection against the adverse effects of a short-term high-fat diet. Aspects of probiotic mechanisms of activity were discussed, including immunomodulatory mechanisms and metabolite effects, the anti-inflammatory properties of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the relationship between periodontitis, microbial production of butyrate in the oral cavity and ageing, and the pathogenic mechanisms of Campylobacter. Finally, an insight was given on a recent expert meeting, which re-examined the probiotic definition, advised on the appropriate use and scope of the term and outlined different probiotic categories and the prevalence of different mechanisms of activity.},

   abstract = {Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) have been implicated in the aetiology of Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory bowel condition. It has been proposed that AIEC-infected macrophages produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines thus contributing to the inflammation observed in CD. AIEC can replicate in macrophages and we wanted to determine if bacterial replication was linked to the high level of cytokine production associated with AIEC-infected macrophages. Therefore, we undertook a genetic analysis of the metabolic requirements for AIEC replication in the macrophage and we show that AIEC replication in this niche is dependent on bacterial glycolysis. In addition, our analyses indicate that AIEC have access to a wide range of nutrients in the macrophage, although the levels of purines and pyrimidines do appear to be limiting. Finally, we show that the macrophage response to AIEC infection is indistinguishable from the response to the non-replicating glycolysis mutant (DeltapfkAB) and a non-pathogenic strain of E. coli, MG1655. Therefore, AIEC does not appear to subvert the normal macrophage response to E. coli during infection.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reversed segments (RS) designed to slow intestinal transit and improve absorption in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) are performed infrequently, and patient selection remains controversial. Our aim was to evaluate patient selection and outcome for RS in SBS patients. METHODS: Sixteen adult patients underwent RS among 520 SBS patients. All patients had remnant length >80 cm and rapid intestinal transit. Ten patients had a colon remnant and 12 had an ostomy. SBS was present for 8 to 150 months prior to RS. RESULTS: RS was performed either alone (n = 9) or concurrently with ostomy closure (n = 5) or creation (n = 2). There were 3 postoperative complications and no deaths. Three patients had bacterial overgrowth. One required repair of an ileocolonic stricture. Two reversed segments were taken down 12 months and 96 months later. Two patients subsequently underwent serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP) procedures, and 1 had isolated intestinal transplant. Fourteen (88%) required parenteral nutrition (PN) pre-operatively and 2 (12%) had intractable diarrhea. Nine (56%) patients improved and 7 (44%) remained on PN or had persistent intractable diarrhea. Patients with a successful outcome were similar to those without improvement with respect to ostomy takedown, duration of SBS, Crohn's disease, intestinal length, a colon remnant, anatomy, and transit time. CONCLUSIONS: Reversed segments significantly benefit one half of selected SBS patients who have rapid transit but adequate remnant length. Outcome in individual patients remains difficult to predict. Subsequent operation is frequently required. This procedure is applicable to a small proportion of SBS patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postresection intestinal adaptation is an augmented self-renewal process that might increase the risk of malignant transformation in the intestine. Furthermore, patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) have other characteristics that might increase this risk. Our aim was to determine the incidence of new intestinal malignancy in SBS patients. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 500 adult SBS patients identified from 1982-2013. There were 199 men and 301 women ranging in age from 19-91 years. Follow-up from the time of diagnosis of SBS ranged from 12-484 months. A total of 186 (37%) patients were followed >5 years. RESULTS: The cause of SBS was postoperative in 35% of patients, malignancy/radiation in 19%, mesenteric vascular disease in 17%, Crohn's disease in 16%, and other in 13%. Twenty-eight (6%) patients received growth stimulatory medications. Fifteen percent of patients had a prior total colectomy. Twenty-eight (6%) patients underwent intestinal transplantation, and 115 (23%) patients had a previous abdominal malignancy, including colorectal cancer in 43 patients. Thirty-six (7%) received radiation therapy. Recurrent colon cancer was found in 2 patients, one at a stoma and the other with lung metastases. New colon cancer was found in 1 patient (0.2%), a 62-year-old woman with long-standing Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: The incidence of colon cancer in this heterogenous group of patients with SBS was similar to that of the normal population. This suggests that the risk of developing a new colon cancer in patients with SBS is not increased.},

   abstract = {Objective Basic and epidemiologic studies on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have suggested an association between vitamin D and IBD risk. Though, the literature on IBD - especially pediatric-onset IBD - and vitamin D is still in its cradle. We therefore wanted to examine if levels of 25(OH)D at birth were associated with increased risk of developing pediatric-onset IBD. Material and methods A case-cohort study composed of cases diagnosed with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or indeterminate/unclassified colitis and healthy controls. Cases and controls were matched on date of birth and were born in the period 1981-2004. Cases were diagnosed before the age of 18 years. The concentration of 25(OH)D was assessed from neonatal dried blood spots using a highly sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated using conditional logistic regression and two-way ANOVA were used to test for season and birth year 25(OH)D variations. A total of 384 matched pairs were included in the statistical analyses. Results No significant association were found between levels of 25(OH)D and IBD risk in the adjusted model (OR [95% CI] (per 25 nmol/L increase), 1.12 [0.88; 1.42], p = 0.35). 25(OH)D levels were found to fluctuate significantly with season (p < 0.001) and year (p < 0.001). Median/Q1-Q3 values for 25(OH)D were 27.1/16.5-39.5 nmol/L for cases and 25.7/16.1-39.4 nmol/L for controls. Conclusion Our study do not suggest that a window of vulnerability exist around time of birth in regards to 25(OH)D levels and later pediatric-onset IBD risk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Identifying patients who are malnourished or at risk for malnutrition may lead to early intervention and improve patient outcomes. To date, little is known about the role of nutritional assessment and management in IBD care. We aimed to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding nutrition in IBD among patients and providers. METHODS: Surveys were mailed electronically to patients and providers identified through their membership in the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America. In addition, patient and provider focus groups were conducted to explore nutrition-related themes. These surveys and focus groups were designed to evaluate knowledge and perceived importance of nutrition, patient-provider interactions regarding nutrition and use of nutritional resources. RESULTS: There were 223 provider respondents (65.5% gastroenterologists, 15.2% nurses, and 6.7% dietitians). Forty-one percent of the gastroenterologists rated their knowledge of nutrition in IBD as "very good" compared with 87% of dietitians and 16% of nurses (P < 0.001). Thirty-three percent of the gastroenterologists reported not routinely screening their IBD patients for malnutrition. The patient survey had 567 respondents with 27% rating their knowledge of nutrition in IBD as "very good." In the focus groups, a lack of adequate IBD nutritional resources was evident along with a desire for improved access to nutrition specialists. CONCLUSIONS: Significant gaps in knowledge relating to nutrition in IBD seem to exist. Targeted educational initiatives and improved access to nutritional experts are warranted. In addition, a standardized process for the assessment of malnutrition among patients with IBD should be developed.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease, is a subject of increasing interest. Loss-of-function mutations in nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) are strong genetic factors linked to Crohn's disease, which eventually leads to an excessive mucosal inflammatory response directed against components of normal gut microbiota. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in inflammation processes, as well as in transduction of signals from receptors for several cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). ROS activate nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via IkappaB kinase (IKK) through the PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway. Therefore, this pathway is recognized to play a key role in Crohn's disease. Loss of function has been demonstrated to occur as an early event in a wide variety of diseases. Given this prevalent involvement in a number of diseases, the molecular development that modulates this pathway has been the subject of several studies. In addition, it has been the focus of extensive research and drug discovery activities. A better understanding of the molecular assemblies may reveal novel targets for the therapeutic development against Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microbiota refers to the population of microorganisms (bacteria, viruses and fungi) that inhabit the entire gastrointestinal tract, more particularly the colon whose role is to maintain the integrity of the intestinal mucosa and control the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria. Alteration in the composition of the gut microbiota is called dysbiosis. Dysbiosis redisposes to inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease and indeterminate colitis. METHODS: The purpose of this literature review is to elucidate the influence of diet on the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota in the healthy gut and the role of diet in the development of dysbiosis. CONCLUSION: The "Western diet", in particular a low - fiber high fat/high carbohydrate diet is one factor that can lead to severe dysbiosis. In contrast, "mediterranean" and vegetarian diets that includes abundant fruits, vegetables, olive oil and oily fish are known for their anti-inflammatory effects and could prevent dysbiosis and subsequent inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease with different described behaviors, including stricture. At present, there are no laboratory studies that can differentiate stricturing CD from other phenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease. We performed a pilot study to examine differences in the proteome among patients with stricturing CD, nonstricturing CD, and ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Serum samples were selected from the Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry, an established cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with CD with surgically resected stricture were matched with similar patients with CD without known stricture and with ulcerative colitis. Serum samples from each patient were digested and analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to characterize the proteome. Statistical analyses were performed to identify peptides and proteins that can differentiate CD with stricture. RESULTS: Samples from 9 patients in each group (27 total patients) were analyzed. Baseline demographic characteristics were similar among the 3 groups. We quantified 7668 peptides and 897 proteins for analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified a subset of peptides with an area under the curve greater than 0.9, indicating greater separation potential. Partial least squares discriminant analysis was able to distinguish among the three groups with up to 70% accuracy by peptides and up to 80% accuracy by proteins. We identified the significantly different proteins and peptides and determined their function based on previously published literature. CONCLUSIONS: The serum of patients with stricturing CD, nonstricturing CD, and ulcerative colitis is distinguishable through proteomic analysis. Some of the proteins that differentiate the stricturing phenotype have been implicated in complement activation, fibrinolytic pathways, and lymphocyte adhesion.},

   abstract = {AIM: The aetiology of Crohn's disease-related anal fistula remains obscure. Microbiological, genetic and immunological factors are thought to play a role but are not well understood. The microbiota within anal fistula tracts has never been examined using molecular techniques. The present study aimed to characterize the microbiota in the tracts of patients with Crohn's and idiopathic anal fistula. METHOD: Samples from the fistula tract and rectum of patients with Crohn's and idiopathic anal fistula were analysed using fluorescent in situ hybridization, Gram staining and scanning electron microscopy were performed to identify and quantify the bacteria present. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients, including 20 with Crohn's anal fistula, 18 with idiopathic anal fistula and 13 with luminal Crohn's disease and no anal fistula, were recruited. Bacteria were not found in close association with the luminal surface of any of the anal fistula tracts. CONCLUSION: Anal fistula tracts generally do not harbour high levels of mucosa-associated microbiota. Crohn's anal fistulas do not seem to harbour specific bacteria. Alternative explanations for the persistence of anal fistula are needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most frequent life-threatening gastrointestinal disease experienced by premature infants in neonatal intensive care units. The challenge for neonatologists is to detect early clinical manifestations of NEC. One strategy would be to identify specific markers that could be used as early diagnostic tools to identify preterm infants most at risk of developing NEC or in the event of a diagnostic dilemma of suspected disease. As a first step in this direction, we sought to determine the specific gene expression profile of NEC. METHODS: Deep sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to establish the gene expression profiles in ileal samples obtained from preterm infants diagnosed with NEC and non-NEC conditions. Data were analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and ToppCluster softwares. RESULTS: Data analysis indicated that the most significant functional pathways over-represented in NEC neonates were associated with immune functions, such as altered T and B cell signaling, B cell development, and the role of pattern recognition receptors for bacteria and viruses. Among the genes that were strongly modulated in neonates with NEC, we observed a significant degree of similarity when compared with those reported in Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression profile analysis revealed a predominantly altered immune response in the intestine of NEC neonates. Moreover, comparative analysis between NEC and Crohn's disease gene expression repertoires revealed a surprisingly high degree of similarity between these two conditions suggesting a new avenue for identifying NEC biomarkers.},

   abstract = {Enteral nutrition (EN) is considered to be of great importance in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and nutritional problems. This comprehensive review is aiming to provide the reader with an update on the role of EN in IBD patients. EN can reduce Crohn's disease (CD) activity and maintain remission in both adults and children. Nutritional support using liquid formulas should be considered for CD patients and in serious cases of ulcerative colitis (UC), especially for those who may require prolonged cycles of corticosteroids. Given that the ultimate goal in the treatment of CD is mucosal healing, this advantage of EN over corticosteroid treatment is valuable in therapeutic decision-making. EN is indicated in active CD, in cases of steroid intolerance, in patient's refusal of steroids, in combination with steroids in undernourished individuals, and in patients with an inflammatory stenosis of the small intestine. No differences between the efficiency of elemental diets and nonelemental formulas have been noticed. EN must be the first choice compared to TPN. EN has a restricted value in the treatment of patients with large bowel CD. In conclusion, it seems important not to underestimate the role of nutrition as supportive care in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although enteral nutrition has been shown to be a viable treatment option for the management of active Crohn's disease (CD), the evidence regarding its clinical benefits compared with standard treatments (e.g. steroids) for maintaining remission in patients with CD has been inconsistent. If enteral nutrition was to be effective, the use of drugs such as steroids and immunosuppressive drugs could be reduced, thereby reducing the likelihood of adverse events associated with these medications. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of elemental nutrition (a type of enteral nutrition) for maintenance of remission in patients with CD. DATA SOURCES: Major bibliographic databases (e.g. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) were searched from inception to August/September 2013. Searches were not limited by study design, language or publication date. Websites for relevant organisations and references of included studies were checked. METHODS: Experimental randomised and non-randomised controlled trials (RCTs and nRCTs) reporting clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of elemental nutrition in the maintenance of remission in patients with CD were eligible. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessment were performed independently. Risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) were pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed via forest plots, Cochran's Q and the I2 statistics. Overall, quality of evidence for each outcome was rated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: Eight studies (three RCTs and five nRCTs) were included in the review. RCTs indicated a significant benefit of elemental nutrition vs. no intervention (an unrestricted diet) in maintaining remission at 24 months [one RCT; RR 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 4.43; very low-grade evidence] and preventing relapse at 12-24 months post baseline (two RCTs; pooled RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.84; I2 = 0%; high-grade evidence). Similarly, three nRCTs showed significant benefits of elemental nutrition over no intervention in maintaining remission at 12-48 months and preventing relapse at 12 months post baseline (MD 1.20 months, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.04 months). The incidence of mucosal healing was not significantly different in the intervention and control groups (RR 2.70, 95% CI 0.62 to 11.72). Adherence to an elemental nutrition regime was significantly worse than adherence to polymeric nutrition (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.92) and, when compared with other active treatments (medications, polymeric nutrition or a combination), elemental nutrition yielded non-significant results with wide 95% CIs, rendering these results inconclusive. Complications and adverse events were too sparse to allow meaningful comparisons. None of the studies reported cost-effectiveness of elemental nutrition. Owing to scarcity of data, subgroup and sensitivity analyses could not be performed to explore methodological and clinical sources of heterogeneity. LIMITATIONS: The findings warrant cautious interpretation given the limitations of the evidence in methodological quality (small samples, short follow-up) and the RoB in individual studies (lack of blinding, confounding). CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence indicates potential benefits of elemental nutrition against no intervention in the maintenance of remission and prevention of relapse in adult patients with CD. There was a lack or insufficient evidence on adverse events and complications. Future large and long-term randomised trials are warranted to draw more definitive conclusions regarding the effects of elemental nutrition in maintaining remission in CD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42013005134. FUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.},

   abstract = {The mucosal immune system (including airway, intestinal, oral and cervical epithelium) is an integrated network of tissues, cells and effector molecules that protect the host from environmental insults and infections at mucous membrane surfaces. Dysregulation of immunity at mucosal surfaces is thought to be responsible for the alarming global increase in mucosal inflammatory diseases such as those affecting the gastrointestinal (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome) and respiratory (asthma, allergy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder) system. Although immune regulation has been well-studied in isolated mucosal sites, the extent of the immune interaction between anatomically distant mucosal sites has been mostly circumstantial and the focus of much debate. With novel technology and more precise tools to examine histological and functional changes in tissues, today there is increased appreciation of the 'common mucosal immunological system' originally proposed by Bienenstock nearly 40 years ago. Evidence is amounting which shows that stimulation of one mucosal compartment can directly and significantly impact distant mucosal site, however the mechanisms are unknown. Today, we are only beginning to understand the complexity of relationships and communications that exist between different mucosal compartments. A holistic approach to studying the mucosal immune system as an integrated global organ is imperative for future advances in understanding mucosal immunology and for future treatment of chronic diseases. In this review, we particularly focus on the latest evidence and the mechanisms operational in driving the lung-gut cross-talk.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Data suggest physicians poorly assess disease-specific literacy and transition readiness in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We piloted an electronic, interactive iPad quiz game that could be used in a clinical setting, with the aims of measuring IBD-related knowledge, and concomitant mood and quality of life (QOL) in a pediatric population. METHODS: Two pediatric IBD clinics developed and tested 2 versions of "Emma." Patients between 10 and 18 years of age played Emma during an office visit. Each patient answered 12 randomly selected disease-related questions and 4 mood-related questions. RESULTS: Sites 1 and 2 tested Emma v1 between May and August 2013. Emma v2 was tested from November 2013 to January 2014 and from September 2013 to January 2014. A total of 56 patients played Emma v1, whereas 60 played Emma v2. In Emma v2, 73.1% of questions were answered correctly. Patients recognized signs of IBD (88%), causes of diarrhea in addition to IBD (79.4%), and could define lactose intolerance (95.8%), but fewer patients understood serological testing used for disease monitoring (68%) or knew that magnetic resonance enterography did not involve radiation (22.9%). Patients tended to report good functioning in the areas of energy, mood, anxiety, and school-related QOL. Patients with Crohn disease, however, reported higher stress levels compared with patients with ulcerative colitis; older patients reported lower energy levels, and postsurgical patients reported lower QOL. CONCLUSIONS: The Emma iPad game has the potential to evaluate gaps in IBD knowledge, assess emotional functioning, and increase patient engagement as a transition tool in the clinical setting.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oral methotrexate (MTX) administration avoids weekly injections, reduces costs and may improve quality of life of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), especially children. Routes of administration have never been systematically compared in CD. We aimed to compare effectiveness and safety of orally (PO) versus subcutaneously (SC) administered MTX in paediatric CD. METHODS: 226 children with CD treated with oral or subcutaneous MTX were included in a multicentre, retrospective 1-year cohort study (62% boys, mean age 13.8+/-2.8 years, 88% previous thiopurines). 38 (17%) were initially commenced on oral, 98 (43%) started subcutaneous and switched to oral and 90 (40%) were treated with subcutaneous only. Matching and 'doubly robust' weighted regression models were based on the propensity score method, controlling for confounding-by-indication bias. 11/23 pretreatment variables were different between the groups, but the propensity score modelling successfully balanced the treatment groups. RESULTS: 76 children (34%) had sustained steroid-free remission with a difference that did not reach significance between the PO and the SC groups (weighted OR=1.72 (95% CI 0.5 to 5.9); p=0.52). There were no differences in need for treatment escalation (p=0.24), elevated liver enzymes (p=0.59) or nausea (p=0.85). Height velocity was lower in the PO group (p=0.006) and time to remission was delayed in the PO group (p=0.036; Fleming (0, 1) test). CONCLUSIONS: In this largest paediatric CD cohort to date, SC administered MTX was superior to PO, but only in some of the outcomes and with a modest effect size. Therefore, it may be reasonable to consider switching children in complete remission treated with subcutaneous MTX to the oral route with close monitoring of inflammatory markers and growth.},

   abstract = {Performing well-designed and ethical trials in pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is a priority to support optimal therapy and reduce the unacceptable long lag between adult and pediatric drug approval. Recently, clinical trials in children have been incorporating placebo arms into their protocols under conditions that created controversy. Therefore, 4 organizations (the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition; European Crohn's and Colitis Organization; the Canadian Children IBD Network; and the Global Pediatric IBD Network) jointly provide a statement on the role of placebo in pediatric IBD trials. Consensus was achieved by 94 of 100 (94%) voting committees' members that placebo should only be used if there is genuine equipoise between the active treatment and placebo; for example, this may be considered in trials of drugs with new mechanisms of action without existing adult data, especially when proven effective alternatives do not exist outside the trial. Placebo may also be used in situations where it is an "add-on" to an effective therapy or to evaluate exit-strategies of maintenance therapy after long-term deep remission. It has been, however, agreed that no child enrolled in a trial should receive a known inferior treatment both within and outside the trial. This also includes withholding therapy in children who show clinical response after a short induction therapy. Given the similarity between pediatric and adult IBD regarding pathophysiology and response to treatments, drugs generally cannot be considered being in genuine equipoise with placebo if it has proven efficacy in adults. Continued collaboration of all stakeholders is needed to facilitate drug development and evaluation in pediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trials in adults suggested that, in ulcerative colitis [UC], once-daily [OD] dosing of 5-ASA [5-amino salicylic acid] may be as or more effective than twice-daily [BD] dosing. In this induction of remission, investigator-blinded, randomised controlled-trial, we aimed to compare effectiveness and safety of once- versus twice-daily mesalazine in paediatric UC. METHODS: Children, aged 4-18 years with a PUCAI [Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index] of 10-55 points at inclusion, were randomised in blocks of six with blinded allocation to OD or BD mesalazine, using a weight-based dosing table. The primary outcome was mean PUCAI score at Week 6. RESULTS: A total of 83/86 randomised children were eligible and analysed: 43 in the OD group and 40 in the BD group (mean age 14 +/- 2.7 years, 43 [52%] males, 51 [62%] extensive colitis). The groups did not differ with regard to disease activity or any other parameter at baseline. There was no difference in median PUCAI score between the OD group and BD group at Week 6: 15 ( interquartile range [IQR] 5-40) versus 10 [0-40]; p = 0.48]. Response was seen in 25 [60%] OD versus 25 [63%] BD dosing [p = 0.78]. Proportion of children in remission [PUCAI < 10] at Week 6 was 13 [30%] OD versus 16 [40%] BD; p = 0.35]. Most adverse events were related to disease aggravation; the rates of serious adverse events were similar [p > 0.2]. CONCLUSIONS: In this first randomised controlled trial in children, no differences were found between OD and BD dosing for any clinical outcome. Remission was achieved in 35% of children treated with mesalazine for active UC.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Smoking whose prevalence is higher in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) worsens its evolution. Ulcerative colitis mostly affect non- or ex-smokers; smoking may improve the course of the disease. OBJECTIVES: Systematic literature review of data on the relationship between smoking, smoking cessation and Crohn'disease. DOCUMENTARY SOURCES: Medline, on the period 1980-2015 with the keywords "Crohn's disease" or "inflammatory bowel disease" and "smoking" or "smoking cessation"; limits "Title/Abstract"; the selected languages were English or French. STUDY SELECTION: Among 1315 articles, 168 abstracts have given rise to a dual reading to select 69 studies (case-control, retrospective, reviews or meta-analysis). Data were extracted using a reading gate. RESULTS: Smoking increases the risk of complications, recurrences and resort of surgery, corticosteroids or immunosuppressants. These deleterious effects are more common in women. Stopping smoking improves the course of the disease and represents an essential component of its management. LIMITS: Heterogeneity of the studies collected according to the type, population characteristics, definition of smoking status and the validation of smoking cessation. CONCLUSION: Smokers suffering from CD must routinely be made aware of the disadvantages of smoking, benefits of abstinence and helped to quit smoking.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis; Crohn's disease) are debilitating relapsing inflammatory disorders affecting the gastrointestinal tract, with deleterious effect on quality of life, and increasing incidence and prevalence. Mucosal inflammation, due to altered microbiota, increased intestinal permeability and immune system dysfunction underlies the symptoms and may be caused in susceptible individuals by different factors (or a combination of them), including dietary habits and components. In this review we describe the influence of the Western diet, obesity, and different nutraceuticals/functional foods (bioactive peptides, phytochemicals, omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D, probiotics and prebiotics) on the course of IBD, and provide some hints that could be useful for nutritional guidance. Hopefully, research will soon offer enough reliable data to slow down the spread of the disease and to make diet a cornerstone in IBD therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aims of the study were to determine the incidence rate of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) and its trends for the period of 2002-2010 and to assess the geographical distribution of PIBD in Slovenia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients (0-18 years) with newly diagnosed IBD during the study period were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The mean incidence rate for IBD in 2002-2010 was 7.6 per 100,000 children and adolescents per year, 4.5 for Crohn's disease (CD), 2.9 for ulcerative colitis (UC), and 0.2 for IBD-unclassified, respectively. The incidence rate increased from 5.8 per 100,000 per year in 2002-2004 to 8.6 in 2005-2007 and remained stable afterwards. Statistically significant difference in the incidence rate between the Northeastern and Southwestern parts of the country was observed (p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: This nationwide study demonstrates that Slovenia is among the European countries with the highest PIBD incidence. During the study period a substantial rise of PIBD incidence was observed during the first half of the study and it seems to have stabilized in the second half. The significant difference in PIBD incidence between Northeastern and Southwestern parts of the country merits further exploration of the possible environmental factors.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Autoimmune cytopenias (AIC) including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and immunologic thrombocytopenia (ITP) are rare immunologic disorders, scarcely reported in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We conducted a multicentric retrospective study, including a case-control analysis, that aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients affected by AIC and IBD. METHOD: Forty cases were recruited from 4 IBD centers and 2 AIC tertiary centers. Controls were recruited from the MICISTA registry. RESULTS: From the MICISTA registry, incidences were estimated at 4.1/100,000 patient-years and 12.5/100,000 patient-years after IBD diagnosis for AIHA and ITP, respectively. All AIHA patients (n=14) had colonic involvement (13/14 with UC), whereas CD (52%) and UC (48%) diagnoses were evenly distributed among ITP patients. Compared to control IBD patients, cases were characterized by a higher frequency of extra-intestinal manifestations (37.5% vs 17%, p<0.001) and by the presence of IBD severity's hallmark. AIHA and IBD ran mainly in parallel, and 12 out of 14 AIHA were warm AIHA. In isolated cases, rituximab and infliximab were efficient to treat IBD and AIC, respectively. IBD surgery may induce AIC remission in some cases. CONCLUSION: Although low, incidence of AIC appears higher in IBD patients compared to the general population. The association seems to be mainly non-fortuitous, especially for colitis-associated AIHA.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), known collectively as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), are chronic immunoinflammatory pathologies of unknown aetiology. Despite the frequent use of biomarkers in medical practice, there is a relative lack of information regarding validated paediatric biomarkers for IBD. Furthermore, biomarkers proved to be efficacious in adults are frequently extrapolated to the paediatric clinical setting without considering that the pathogenesis of many diseases is distinctly different in children. In the present study, proteomics technology was used to monitor differences in protein expression among adult and young patients with CD, identify a panel of candidate protein biomarkers that may be used to improve prognostic-diagnostic accuracy, and advance paediatric medical care. METHODS: Male and female serum samples from 12 adults and 12 children with active CD were subjected to 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Following the relative quantitation of protein spots exhibiting a differential expression between the 2 groups by densitometry, the spots were further characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The results were confirmed by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Clusterin was found to be significantly overexpressed in adults with CD, whereas ceruloplasmin and apolipoprotein B-100 were found to be significantly overexpressed in children, indicating that the expression of these proteins may be implicated in the onset or progression of CD in these 2 subgroups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Interestingly, we found a differential expression of several proteins in adults versus paediatric patients with CD. Undoubtedly, future experiments using a larger cohort of patients with CD are needed to evaluate the relevance of our preliminary findings.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liver enzymes (LEs) abnormalities associated with pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are understudied. We undertook to describe the development and associations of abnormal LEs in pediatric IBD. METHODS: We ascertained a cohort of 300 children with IBD and collected retrospective data. A Kaplan-Meier analysis determined the time to development of different thresholds of abnormal LEs. Associations between clinical variables and the development of abnormal LEs were determined. RESULTS: The probability of developing the first episode of abnormal LEs above the upper limit of normal (ULN) within 150 months was 58.1% (16.3% by 1 mo post-IBD diagnosis). There was a 6% prevalence of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC) in this cohort. Of those diagnosed with PSC/ASC, 93% had persistent LE elevations at a threshold of >2x ULN, while those without PSC/ASC had a 4% probability of this abnormality. Elevated gamma glutamyltranspeptidase levels of 252 U/L had a 99% sensitivity and 71% specificity for PSC/ASC in IBD. After exclusion of patients with PSC/ASC, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and exclusive enteral nutrition demonstrated strongly positive associations with the first development of abnormal LEs >ULN (hazard ratio 2.1 [95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.3], hazard ratio 5.6 [95% confidence interval, 3.6-8.9], hazard ratio 4.2 [95% confidence interval, 1.6-11.3], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal LEs are common in pediatric IBD and occur early. PSC/ASC is associated with persistently high LEs and gamma glutamyltranspeptidase levels >252 U/L. Children with IBD are at risk of elevated LEs if they require medications other than 5-ASA to induce IBD remission.},

   abstract = {The management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has changed since the mid-1990s (e.g., use of thiopurines/anti-TNFalpha agents, improved surveillance programs), possibly affecting cancer risk. To establish current cancer risk in IBD, updates are warranted from cohorts covering this time span, and detailed enough to study associations with phenotype and medication. We studied intestinal-, extra-intestinal- and overall cancer risk in the Dutch population-based IBDSL cohort. In total, 1,157 Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,644 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were diagnosed between 1991 and 2011, and followed until 2013. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for CD and UC separately, as well as for gender-, phenotype-, disease duration-, diagnosis era- and medication groups. We found an increased risk for colorectal cancer in CD patients with colon involvement (SIR 2.97; 95% CI 1.08-6.46), but not in the total CD or UC population. In addition, CD patients were at increased risk for hematologic- (2.41; 1.04-4.76), overall skin- (1.55; 1.06-2.19), skin squamous cell- (SCC; 3.83; 1.83-7.04) and overall cancer (1.28; 1.01-1.60), whereas UC patients had no increased risk for extra-intestinal- and overall cancer. Finally, in a medication analysis on CD and UC together, long-term immunosuppression exposure (>12 months) was associated with an increased risk for hematologic cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, SCC and overall cancer, and this increase was mainly attributed to thiopurines. IBD patients with long-term immunosuppression exposure can be considered as having a higher cancer risk, and our data support the advice in recent IBD guidelines to consider skin cancer screening in these patients.},

   abstract = {The treatment armamentarium in pediatric Crohn disease (CD) is very similar to adult-onset CD with the notable exception of the use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN [the administration of a liquid formula diet while excluding normal diet]), which is used more frequently by pediatric gastroenterologists to induce remission. In pediatric CD, EEN is now recommended by the pediatric committee of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition as a first-choice agent to induce remission, with remission rates in pediatric studies consistently >75%. To chart and address enablers and barriers of use of EEN in Canada, a workshop was held in September 2014 in Toronto (Ontario), inviting pediatric gastroenterologists, nurses and dietitians from most Canadian pediatric IBD centres as well as international faculty from the United States and Europe with particular research and clinical expertise in the dietary management of pediatric CD. Workshop participants ranked the exclusivity of enteral nutrition; the health care resources; and cost implications as the top three barriers to its use. Conversely, key enablers mentioned included: standardization and sharing of protocols for use of enteral nutrition; ensuring sufficient dietetic resources; and reducing the cost of EEN to the family (including advocacy for reimbursement by provincial ministries of health and private insurance companies). Herein, the authors report on the discussions during this workshop and list strategies to enhance the use of EEN as a treatment option in the treatment of pediatric CD in Canada.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are multifactorial, relapsing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. However, the etiology is still poorly understood but involves altered immune responses, epithelial dysfunction, environmental factors, and nutrition. Recently, we have shown that the diet supplement corabion has cardioprotective effects due to reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation. Since oxidative stress and inflammation are also prominent risk factors in IBD, we speculated that corabion also has beneficial effects on experimental colitis. Colitis was induced in male mice by administration of 3.5% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for a period of 3 or 7 days with or without daily gavage feeding of corabion consisting of vitamin C, vitamin E, L-arginine, and eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid. We found that corabion administration attenuated DSS-induced colon shortening, tissue damage, and disease activity index during the onset of colitis. Mechanistically, these effects could be explained by reduced neutrophil recruitment, oxidative stress, production of proinflammatory cytokines, and internalization of the junctional proteins ZO-1 and E-cadherin leading to less edema formation. Thus, corabion may be a useful diet supplement for the management of chronic inflammatory intestinal disorders such as IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in pediatric patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) and organic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases with an age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-matched healthy sample across GI diagnostic groups and with one another. STUDY DESIGN: The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 689 families. Patients had 1 of 7 physician-diagnosed GI disorders: chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The healthy control sample included 1114 families. School days missed, days in bed and needing care, parent missed workdays, work impact, and healthcare utilization were compared as well. RESULTS: Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease demonstrated lower HRQOL than the healthy controls across all dimensions (physical, emotional, social, and school; P < .001 for all), with larger effect sizes for patients with an FGID. Patients with an FGID manifested lower HRQOL than those with an organic GI disease. Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease missed more school, spent more days in bed and needing care, had greater healthcare utilization, and had parents who missed more workdays with greater work impact (P < .001 for most), with larger effect sizes for the patients with an FGID. CONCLUSION: Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease demonstrate impaired HRQOL compared with healthy children. HRQOL can be used as a common metric to compare patient outcomes in clinical research and practice both within and across groups of patients with FGIDs and organic GI diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes are essential in determining the broad impact of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and treatments from the patient's perspective. The primary study objectives were to compare the gastrointestinal symptoms and worry of pediatric patients with IBD with matched healthy controls and to compare Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with each other using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. METHODS: PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 256 pediatric patients with IBD and 259 parents of patients (263 families; Crohn's disease [n = 195], ulcerative colitis [n = 68]). Ten Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea were administered along with 2 Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. A matched group of 384 healthy children families completed the PedsQL in an Internet survey. RESULTS: PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales distinguished between pediatric patients with IBD in comparison with healthy controls (P < 0.001), with larger effect sizes for symptoms indicative of IBD, supporting known-groups validity and clinical interpretability including minimal important difference scores. Patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis did not demonstrate significantly different gastrointestinal symptoms or worry in comparison with each other. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales may be used as common metrics across pediatric patients with IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis separately to measure gastrointestinal-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) and markers of vitamin D status in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of 59 pediatric patients with IBD (age 16.4 +/- 2.2 y) and 116 controls (age 14.6 +/- 4.4 y), to investigate the association between 25(OH)D and albuminemia for protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) and hepatic dysfunction; alanine transaminase (ALT) for hepatic inflammation; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for intestinal inflammation; body mass index (BMI) for adiposity; seasons and skin pigmentation for insolation. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L; abnormal liver enzyme by ALT >40 U/L; overweight status by BMI of >/=85th but <95th percentile, and obesity by BMI >/=95th percentile. Seasons were categorized as summer, winter, spring, and fall. RESULTS: Patients with IBD had a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (42.4% versus 26.7%; P = 0.04), elevated ALT (16.9% versus 2.6%; P < 0.001), and lower albumin (41.1 +/- 4.8 versus 45.1 +/- 3.8; P < 0.001) than controls. In both the IBD cohort and controls, 25(OH)D was highest in summer and lowest in winter, and significantly higher in white than in non-white patients. ESR varied significantly with 25(OH)D (R(2) = 0.24; beta = -0.32; P = 0.010), and only patients with IBD with elevated ESR had lower 25(OH)D than controls (49.5 +/- 25.2 versus 65.3 +/- 28.0 nmol/L; P = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Intestinal inflammation, not the loss of albumin-bound vitamin D in the gut, is the primary intestinal determinant of vitamin D status in IBD. The extraintestinal determinants are seasons and skin pigmentation, but not adiposity and hepatic inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Filgotinib (GLPG0634, GS-6034) is a once-daily, orally administered, Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)-selective inhibitor. The FITZROY study examined the efficacy and safety of filgotinib for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study, which recruited patients from 52 centres in nine European countries. We enrolled eligible patients aged 18-75 years with a documented history of ileal, colonic, or ileocolonic Crohn's disease for 3 months or more before screening, as assessed by colonoscopy and supported by histology, and a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score during screening between 220 and 450 inclusive. Patients were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive filgotinib 200 mg once a day or placebo for 10 weeks. Patients were stratified according to previous anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha exposure, C-reactive protein concentration at screening (</=10 mg/L or >10 mg/L), and oral corticosteroid use at baseline, using an interactive web-based response system. The primary endpoint was clinical remission, defined as CDAI less than 150 at week 10. After week 10, patients were assigned based on responder status to filgotinib 100 mg once a day, filgotinib 200 mg once a day, or placebo for an observational period lasting a further 10 weeks. The filgotinib and placebo treatment groups were compared using ANCOVA models and logistic regression models containing baseline values and randomisation stratification factors as fixed effects. Analyses were done on the intention-to-treat non-responder imputation set. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02048618. FINDINGS: Between Feb 3, 2014, and July 10, 2015, we enrolled 174 patients with active Crohn's disease confirmed by centrally read endoscopy (130 in the filgotinib 200 mg group and 44 in the placebo group). In the intention-to-treat population, 60 (47%) of 128 patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg achieved clinical remission at week 10 versus ten (23%) of 44 patients treated with placebo (difference 24 percentage points [95% CI 9-39], p=0.0077). In a pooled analysis of all periods of filgotinib and placebo exposure over 20 weeks, serious treatment-emergent adverse effects were reported in 14 (9%) of 152 patients treated with filgotinib and three (4%) of 67 patients treated with placebo. INTERPRETATION: Filgotinib induced clinical remission in significantly more patients with active Crohn's disease compared with placebo, and had an acceptable safety profile. FUNDING: Galapagos.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet is one of the main drivers of the composition and function of the gut microbiota. The scope of this review is to summarize recent studies assessing the role of gut microbiota in clinical pediatric conditions and to review studies using nutritional approaches to favorably modify the gut microbiota to improve health outcomes in children. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies underscore that breastfeeding and infant diet impact the gut microbiome and metagenome. A comprehensive study using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, suggests that the cessation of breastfeeding rather than the introduction of solid foods, drives the functional maturation of the infant gut microbiome toward an adult-like state. There is further support for the view that a disturbed early gut microbiota is implicated in allergic and autoimmune diseases. New studies using prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in various pediatric disorders have yielded promising results, yet the evidence for specific guidelines on their use is still low. SUMMARY: Intestinal dysbiosis is associated with several pediatric disorders but a cause-effect relationship remains to be clearly demonstrated in most conditions. Future studies using new systems biology approaches are anticipated to provide further insight into the functional capacities of the gut microbiome and its establishment in childhood. This may then lay the ground for improved treatment and prevention strategies targeting the gut microbiota.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-associated disruption of the gut microbiota is a known risk factor for Crohn's disease. This chronic inflammatory disorder results from aberrant host immune responses to subsets of the gut microbiota, and is characterized by intense neutrophil recruitment to the lamina propria, surface and crypt epithelium. Importantly, adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) is abundant in ileal biopsies, highlighting a possible etiological role. In this study, we investigated the impact of antibiotics and AIEC challenge on murine intestinal dysbiosis and neutrophil extracellular trap activation, which is a critical component of the neutrophil antimicrobial repertoire. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were administered vancomycin and gentamicin (once daily, 3 days), and subsequently challenged with AIEC strain LF82 (once daily, 2 days). Perturbation of the gut microbiota was monitored using a combination of molecular and phylogenetic analyses. The impact of commensal and dysbiotic gut bacterial communities on neutrophil extracellular trap mobilization and intestinal redox balance was also quantified. RESULTS: Exposure of neutrophils to murine commensal gut microbial communities activated neutrophil extracellular trap formation. The capacity of neutrophils to cast these web-like structures was exacerbated following antibiotic and AIEC-associated intestinal dysbiosis, highlighting the possible overgrowth of immune-activating intestinal pathobionts. Intestinal dysbiosis was associated with an elevated capacity of the cultivated gut bacteria to produce reactive oxygen species in vitro, and increased colonic oxidative stress in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data provide new insights into the detrimental effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiota, with clinically relevant implications for intestinal dysbiosis on neutrophil function and intestinal redox balance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIM: Although inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at risk for metabolic bone disease, studies analyzing this correlation have identified various risk factors, including disease phenotype, age, sex and steroid therapy. Furthermore, few studies have assessed risk factors for bone loss in Japanese IBD patients. This study analyzed risk factors for metabolic bone disease in Japanese IBD patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed 388 patients with IBD aged 20-50 years, including 232 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 156 with Crohn's disease (CD). Bone mineral density of the femoral neck, total femur and lumbar spine was quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The blood concentrations of bone metabolism markers were measured. History of smoking and bone fracture, and nutritional intake were assessed using questionnaires. RESULTS: Of the 388 patients with IBD, 78 (20.1%; UC, 17.2%; CD, 24.4%) had osteopenia and 17 (4.4%; UC, 3.4%; CD, 5.8%) had osteoporosis, as assessed by T-score. Bone mineral density of the lumbar vertebrae was lower in males than in females. Multivariate regression analysis showed that risk factors for bone loss in UC patients were male sex, low body mass index (BMI), high steroid dose and disease location. Risk factors for bone loss in CD patients were male sex and low BMI. CONCLUSION: Among Japanese patients with IBD, male sex and low BMI were associated with increased risk for metabolic bone disease. In addition, Steroid therapy shouldn't be indiscriminate in UC patients. These findings may help identify patients at particularly high risk of metabolic bone disease and may help implement appropriate therapies in a timely manner and improve long-term quality of life.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Colonoscopy with biopsy sampling is often performed to detect collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) in patients with chronic non-bloody diarrhea. However, the diagnostic yield is low and incurs high costs. Fecal calprotectin (FC) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) indicate intestinal inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). In CC, elevated fecal levels of eosinophil protein X (EPX) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) have been reported. We aimed to evaluate if F-EPX, F-ECP, FC, and F-MPO could predict the diagnostic outcome in patients with chronic non-bloody diarrhea referred to colonoscopy. We also evaluated serum (S) EPX and ECP in this regard. METHODS: Of 67 included patients, 63 (94%) underwent colonoscopy with biopsy sampling. Fecal EPX, F-ECP, FC, F-MPO, S-EPX, and S-ECP were analyzed. RESULTS: Diagnostic outcome: normal: n = 46 (73%), CC: n = 9 (14%), LC: n = 4 (6%), UC: n = 2 (3%), CD: n = 2 (3%). Higher levels of F-EPX and F-ECP were found in CC compared to a normal diagnostic outcome (p = 0.01). No change was noted in any of the fecal markers in LC. When all of the fecal markers were normal the probability of a normal diagnostic outcome was 92%. We found no differences in S-EPX and S-ECP between the groups. CONCLUSION: Elevated F-EPX and F-ECP could predict CC. None of the fecal markers predicted LC. Serum-EPX and S-ECP are not useful for the diagnosis of CC, LC, UC, or CD. With normal levels in all of the analyzed fecal markers, there is a low probability of a pathologic diagnostic outcome.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Medically intractable pediatric ulcerative colitis can lead to colectomy after which patients commonly receive an ileoanal pouch. Postoperative complications are more common in patients with Crohn disease, a diagnosis that may be rendered after the colectomy specimen is examined. Because most children are likely to be exposed to medications before colectomy, we sought to examine whether such exposure influences the distribution of the inflammation within the resected colon and therefore potentially raise questions about the diagnosis accuracy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 32 pediatric ulcerative colitis cases undergoing colectomy from 2007 to 2014 for clinical data and precolectomy treatment history. The resected colon histology was reviewed independently by 2 blinded pathologists. The acute/active inflammation was scored using the modified Riley score for 3 colonic segments (proximal, transverse, and distal colon) for each patient. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate possible association between acute/active inflammation scores at various sites and medication use. RESULTS: Twelve cases (38%) showed decreasing acute inflammation score distally to proximally, 8 (25%) had increasing scores, and 12 cases showed no change. Patients were most commonly exposed to corticosteroids, followed by anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies. There was no statistically or clinically significant change in the histologic scores across the colonic segments of the resected colon in association with exposure to any specific medication or combination of medications, sex, age at diagnosis and surgery, or duration of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Precolectomy therapy does not seem to influence the distribution of inflammation within the resected colon.},

   abstract = {Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A significant proportion of children with ASD and gastrointestinal symptoms have histologic evidence of ileocolitis (inflammation of the terminal ileum and/or colon). We previously reported the molecular characterization of gastrointestinal biopsy tissue from ASD children with ileocolitis (ASDIC+) compared to anatomically similar inflamed tissue from typically developing children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; i.e. Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) and typically developing children with gastrointestinal symptoms but no evidence of gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation (TDIC-). ASDIC+ children had a gene expression profile that, while primarily overlapping with known IBD, had distinctive differences. The present study confirms these findings and replicates this molecular characterization in a second cohort of cases (ASDIC+) and controls (TDIC-). In these two separate case/control mucosal-based cohorts, we have demonstrated overlap of 59 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) unique to inflamed ileocolonic tissue from symptomatic ASDIC+ children. We now report that 9 of these 59 transcripts are also differentially expressed in the peripheral blood of the second cohort of ASDIC+ children. This set of transcripts represents a putative blood-based biomarker for ASD-associated ileocolonic inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Enteral feeding will induce remission in as many as 80-90% of compliant patients with active Crohn's disease (CD), but its method of action remains uncertain. This study was designed to examine its effects on the colonic microbiome. METHODS/SUBJECTS: Healthy volunteers and patients with CD followed a regimen confined to enteral feeds alone for 1 or 2 weeks, respectively. Chemicals excreted on breath or in faeces were characterised at the start and at the end of the feeding period by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. RESULTS: One week of feeding in healthy volunteers caused significant changes in stool colour and deterioration in breath odour, together with increased excretion of phenol and indoles on the breath. Feeding for 2 weeks in patients with CD produced significant improvements in symptoms and a decrease in the concentration of C-reactive protein. The faecal concentrations of microbial products, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and potentially toxic substances, including 1-propanol, 1-butanol and the methyl and ethyl esters of SCFAs, showed significant falls. CONCLUSIONS: A significant change occurs in the production of microbial metabolites after enteral feeding in both healthy volunteers and patients with CD. Many of those detected in CD are toxic and may feasibly lead to the immunological attack on the gut microbiota, which is characteristic of inflammatory bowel disease. The reduction in the production of such metabolites after enteral feeding may be the reason for its effectiveness in CD.},

   abstract = {The relationship between the host and its microbiota is challenging to understand because both microbial communities and their environments are highly variable. We have developed a set of techniques based on population dynamics and information theory to address this challenge. These methods identify additional bacterial taxa associated with pediatric Crohn disease and can detect significant changes in microbial communities with fewer samples than previous statistical approaches required. We have also substantially improved the accuracy of the diagnosis based on the microbiota from stool samples, and we found that the ecological niche of a microbe predicts its role in Crohn disease. Bacteria typically residing in the lumen of healthy individuals decrease in disease, whereas bacteria typically residing on the mucosa of healthy individuals increase in disease. Our results also show that the associations with Crohn disease are evolutionarily conserved and provide a mutual information-based method to depict dysbiosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enteral nutrition [EN] was reported to be as effective as steroids in achieving short-term remission in patients with Crohn's disease [CD], and exclusive EN [EEN] is widely used as primary therapy in children with CD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a specific multi-fibre mix [MF], designed to match the fibre content of a healthy diet, on intestinal epithelial barrier function in IL-10 knockout [IL-10(-/-)] mice with spontaneous chronic colitis. METHODS: IL-10(-/-) mice aged 16 weeks, with established colitis, were used for the experiments with multi-fibre mix diet [MF] for 4 weeks. Severity of colitis, levels of short cahin fatty acids [SCFA] in caecum contents, expression of STAT 3 and STAT 4 proteins, CD4(+) CD45(+) lymphocytes, CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells [Tregs] and cytokines in the lamina propria [LP], epithelial expression of tight junction proteins, TNF-alpha/TNFR2 mRNA expression, and epithelial apoptosis in the proximal colon were measured at the end of the experiment. RESULTS: MF feeding effectively attenuated disease activity index and colitis associated with decreased lamina propria CD4(+) CD45(+) lymphocytes, IFN-gamma/IL-17A mRNA expression, and p-STAT 3 and p-STAT 4 expression in colonic mucosa of IL-10(-/-) mice [p < 0.05]. Furthermore, CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs in the LP and concentrations of total SCFA, acetate, propionate, and butyrate in the caecum were markedly increased after MF feeding in IL-10(-/-) mice. After MF feeding, increased epithelial expression and correct localisation of tight junction proteins [occludin and zona occludens protein 1], as well as reduced TNF-alpha/TNFR2 mRNA expression and epithelial apoptosis, were also observed in IL-10(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that EEN supplemented with the tested fibre mix, known to modulate the intestinal microbiota composition and SCFA production, could possibly improve efficacy in inducing remission in patients with active CD.},

The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of preoperative exclusive EN on postoperative complications and recurrence after bowel resection in patients with active CD. METHODS: Patient data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. 81 patients who received bowel resection for ileal or ileocolonic CD were studied. Before operation, 42 CD patients received exclusive EN for 4 weeks, and the other patients had no nutritional therapy. All patients were followed up regularly for 2 years after surgery, and ileocolonoscopy was performed every 6 months after bowel resection. RESULTS: Patients receiving exclusive EN had a dramatic improvement of nutritional (BMI, albumin, pre-albumin, and Hb) and inflammatory (CRP and CDAI) status compared with baseline after the EN therapy for 4 weeks (P < 0.05). Furthermore, significantly lower incidence of both infectious and non-infectious complications was observed in patients receiving exclusive EN compared with those received no nutritional therapy (P < 0.05). Exclusive EN therapy for 4 weeks significantly reduced endoscopic recurrence rates after resection for CD 6 months after operation. However, during the 2-year follow-up, incidence of clinical recurrence was similar in both groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative exclusive EN therapy for 4 weeks reduced postoperative complications, which may be associated with improvement of nutritional and inflammatory status in patients with active CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a risk factor for vitamin B12 deficiency due to frequent involvement of the terminal ileum. Conventional screening for B12 deficiency with serum B12 is relatively insensitive and measures total B12 concentration, of which a minority is present in a biologically active form. Holotranscobalamin (holoTC) combined with methylmalonic acid (MMA) is believed to be more accurate in identifying impaired B12 status. We evaluated the prevalence and risk factors for B12 deficiency using holoTC supported by MMA among patients with CD. METHODS: We performed a single-center service evaluation of 381 patients with CD who underwent B12 assessment (holoTC/MMA) and compared them with 141 patients with ulcerative colitis. Eighty-nine patients with CD underwent paired serum B12 and holoTC. Among patients with CD, risk factors including terminal ileal resection length, ileal inflammation on endoscopy, and disease characteristics on magnetic resonance imaging were recorded. RESULTS: Prevalence of B12 deficiency among patients with CD was 33% compared with 16% in ulcerative colitis (P < 0.0001). In 89 patients who underwent paired tests, conventional testing identified B12 deficiency in 5% of patients with CD, which increased to 32% using holoTC/MMA. Independent risk factors for B12 deficiency were ileal resection length </=20 cm (odds ratio: 3.0, 95% confidence interval, 1.5-6.0, P = 0.002) and >20 cm (odds ratio: 6.7, 95% confidence interval, 3.0-14.7, P < 0.0001) and ileal inflammation (odds ratio: 3.9, 95% confidence interval, 2.2-6.9, P < 0.0001). On magnetic resonance imaging, active terminal ileal inflammation (P = 0.02) and an increased disease burden (>/=1 skip lesion, P = 0.01 and prestenotic dilatation >3 cm, P = 0.01) were associated with B12 deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in patients with CD. holoTC supported by MMA identifies patients with B12 deficiency considered replete on conventional testing.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thioguanine (TG) is efficacious in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but its toxicity, particularly nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver, has limited its use. We assessed the long-term clinical outcomes and safety of TG in patients whom were intolerant or refractory to conventional immunomodulators. METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-centre study of IBD patients treated with TG from 2001-2013. Response was defined as clinical remission (Harvey-Bradshaw Index < 5 for Crohn's disease (CD), Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index < 4 for ulcerative colitis (UC)) without corticosteroids or, if receiving anti-tumour-necrosis-factor (anti-TNF) therapy, absence of dose escalation. We recorded TG failure, withdrawal and adverse events. Patients were monitored with biochemistry, liver biopsy and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: 54 patients (47 CD and 7 UC) whom received TG (mean dose: 27 mg/d (range: 20-40 mg/d)) as monotherapy (n = 36) or concomitantly with anti-TNF (n = 18) for a median inter-quartile range of 16 (5-37) months (126 patient-years of follow-up). 32 (59%) patients responded to TG at 6 months and 23 (43%) at 12 months. Pancreatitis did not recur amongst the 19 patients with prior thiopurine-induced pancreatitis. 16 (30%) patients ceased TG due to intolerance or toxicity (four serious); NRH was not observed. 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentrations did not correlate with efficacy nor with toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: TG was efficacious and well tolerated in one out of two patients who had previously failed conventional immunomodulators. NRH did not occur.},

We also aimed to describe the psychological profile of this group, assess predictors of disease and the impact of IBD-FAPD on quality of life. METHODS: This cross-sectional prospective study included patients aged 8-18 years with a diagnosis of IBD. Disease activity was assessed by physician's global assessment, laboratory studies, and aPCDAI or PUCAI scoring. Age appropriate validated questionnaires were used to diagnose FAPDs according to the Rome III criteria, depression, anxiety symptoms and quality of life. RESULTS: There were 128 patients recruited. Eighty-one (63%) completed questionnaires (36 females; 45 males; mean age 14.4 +/- 2.6 years) (62 Crohn's disease [CD], 19 ulcerative colitis [UC]). The prevalence of IBD-FAPD in clinical remission was 26% (17 CD, 4 UC; 95% CI: 20.6% - 79.4%), with significantly more females having IBD-FAPD (p=0.038). Anxiety symptoms were in 14.3% of IBD-FAPD patients (p=0.06) and depression in 23.8% (p=0.006). The average Peds QoL-GI score for the IBD-FAPD group was significantly lower than those without FAPDs (71 vs. 86.5, p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, the prevalence of IBD-FAPD was 26 %. This is the first study to assess all FAPDs using the Rome III criteria and to demonstrate increased anxiety, depression and worse quality of life in children with IBD-FAPD. The identification of patients predisposed to IBD-FAPD may allow implementing strategies that could improve symptoms and quality of life.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are chronic, life-long, and relapsing diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Currently, there are no complete cure possibilities, but combined pharmacological and nutritional therapy may induce remission of the disease. Malnutrition and specific nutritional deficiencies are frequent among IBD patients, so the majority of them need nutritional treatment, which not only improves the state of nutrition of the patients but has strong anti-inflammatory activity as well. Moreover, some nutrients, from early stages of life are suspected as triggering factors in the etiopathogenesis of IBD. Both parenteral and enteral nutrition is used in IBD therapy, but their practical utility in different populations and in different countries is not clearly established, and there are sometimes conflicting theories concerning the role of nutrition in IBD. This review presents the actual data from research studies on the influence of nutrition on the etiopathogenesis of IBD and the latest findings regarding its mechanisms of action. The use of both parenteral and enteral nutrition as therapeutic methods in induction and maintenance therapy in IBD treatment is also extensively discussed. Comparison of the latest research data, scientific theories concerning the role of nutrition in IBD, and different opinions about them are also presented and discussed. Additionally, some potential future perspectives for nutritional therapy are highlighted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tobacco use patterns and effects in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease have been extensively studied, however the role and patterns of cannabis use remains poorly defined. Our aim was to evaluate patterns of marijuana use in a large population based survey. METHODS: Cases were identified from the NHANES database from the National Center for Health Statistics for the time period from January, 2009 through December, 2010 as having ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, and exact matched with controls using the Propensity Score Module of SPSS, based on age, gender, and sample weighted using the nearest neighbor method. RESULTS: After weighting, 2084,895 subjects with IBD and 2013,901 control subjects were identified with no significant differences in demographic characteristics. Subjects with IBD had a higher incidence of ever having used marijuana/hashish (M/H) (67.3% vs. 60.0%) and an earlier age of onset of M/H use (15.7 years vs. 19.6 years). Patients with IBD were less likely to have used M/H every month for a year, but more likely to use a heavier amount per day (64.9% subjects with IBD used three or more joints per day vs. 80.5% of subjects without IBD used two or fewer joints per day). In multivariable logistic regression, presence of IBD, male gender, and age over 40 years predicted M/H use. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to evaluate marijuana patterns in a large-scale population based survey. Older, male IBD patients have the highest odds of marijuana use.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Malnutrition, protein-energy, and micronutrient deficiencies are common among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The deficiencies are a manifestation of the complicated disease and a cause of morbidity. The present review summarizes recent advances and evidence-based knowledge regarding micronutrients in relation to patients with IBD. RECENT FINDINGS: Micronutrient deficiencies occur in more than half of patients with IBD. Most common are deficiencies of iron, B12, vitamin D, vitamin K, folic acid, selenium, zinc, vitamin B6, and vitamin B1. Deficiencies are more common in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis, and more in active disease than at times of remission. Micronutrient deficiency is associated with prolonged and complicated course of disease. Iron deficiency is the most common cause for anemia. Definite diagnosis of B12 deficiency cannot be established by serum levels alone. Vitamin D and vitamin K deficiencies are thought to be associated with heightened inflammatory state. The relationship of these deficiencies with bone disease is controversial. The present review focuses on the significance, epidemiology, treatment options, and recommendations regarding micronutrient deficiencies in IBD. SUMMARY: Micronutrient deficiencies are common and have clinical significance. High suspicion for micronutrient deficiencies is advocated so that treatable causes of morbidity are treated appropriately and late and irreversible sequlae are prevented.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Body composition prediction equations using skinfolds are useful alternatives to advanced techniques, but their utility across diverse paediatric populations is unknown. AIM: To evaluate published and new prediction equations across diverse samples of children with health conditions affecting growth and body composition. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Anthropometric and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) body composition measures were obtained in children with Down syndrome (n = 59), Crohn disease (n = 128), steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (n = 67) and a healthy reference group (n = 835). Published body composition equations were evaluated. New equations were developed for ages 3-21 years using the healthy reference sample and validated in other groups and national survey data. RESULTS: Fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM) and percentage body fat (%BF) from published equations were highly correlated with DXA-derived measures (r = 0.71-0.98), but with poor agreement (mean difference = 2.4 kg, -1.9 kg and 6.3% for FM, FFM and %BF). New equations produced similar correlations (r = 0.85-1.0) with improved agreement for the reference group (0.2 kg, 0.4 kg and 0.0% for FM, FFM and %BF, respectively) and in sub-groups. CONCLUSIONS: New body composition prediction equations show excellent agreement with DXA and improve body composition estimation in healthy children and those with selected conditions affecting growth.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Transition may be associated with poor health outcomes, but limited data exist regarding inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Acquisition of self-management skills is believed to be important to this process. IBD-specific checklists of such skills have been developed to aid in transition, but none has been well studied or validated. This study aimed to describe self-assessment ability to perform tasks on one of these checklists and to explore the relation between patient age and disease duration. METHODS: Patients ages 10 to 21 years with IBD were recruited. An iPad survey queried the patients for self-assessment of ability to perform specific self-management tasks. Task categories included basic knowledge of IBD, doctor visits, medications and other treatments, and disease management. Associations with age and disease duration were tested with Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients (31 boys) with Crohn disease (n = 40), ulcerative colitis (n = 25), and indeterminate colitis (n = 2) participated in the study. Mean patient age was 15.8 +/- 2.5 years, with median disease duration of 5 years (2 months-14 years). The proportion of patients who self-reported ability to complete a task without help increased with age for most tasks, including "telling others my diagnosis" (rho = 0.43, P = 0.003), "telling medical staff I do not like or am having trouble following a treatment" (rho = 0.37, P = 0.003), and "naming my medications" (rho = 0.28, P = 0.02). No task significantly improved with disease duration. CONCLUSIONS: Self-assessment of ability to perform some key tasks of transition appears to improve with age, but not with disease duration. More important, communication with the medical team did not improve with age, despite being of critical importance to functioning within an adult care model.},

The largest variability in the components of body composition occurs at the time of a new diagnosis and in periods of disease exacerbation. AIM: Assessment of body composition in children with UC and CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The preliminary study included 59 children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (34 children with UC vs. 25 children with CD) aged 4-18 years. The final analysis included 26 newly diagnosed children (16 children with UC vs. 10 children with CD). The evaluation of body composition was conducted by means of BIA-101 bioimpedance analyser. RESULTS: Decreased values of lean mass were found in children with newly diagnosed IBD (UC: 41.13 kg vs. control group: 42.06 kg; CD: 35.50 kg vs. control group: 45.50 kg). After a year interval, an increase in fat (UC 1: 7.67 kg vs. UC 2: 10.33 kg; CD 1: 7.36 kg vs. CD 2: 9.47 kg) as well as lean body mass (UC 1: 35.22 kg vs. UC 2: 39.00 kg; CD 1: 35.99 kg vs. CD 2: 42.41 kg) was found in children. CONCLUSIONS: Children with newly diagnosed IBD were highly vulnerable to nutritional status disturbances. The increase in fat and lean body mass in an annual interval may be due to the treatment regime and control of the children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perianal disease is a manifestation of Crohn's disease (CD) that has poor long-term treatment outcomes. The aim was to determine if rectal endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided therapy with adalimumab (ADA) can improve outcomes for patients with perianal fistulizing CD. METHODS: This is a randomized prospective study comparing serial EUS guidance of fistula treatment versus standard of care in fistulizing perianal CD. At enrollment, all patients underwent a rectal EUS and an EUA with seton placement and/or I&D. Treatment was maximized with immunomodulators, antibiotics, and ADA induction. Surgical interventions were determined by the surgeon's discretion in the control group and assisted by every 12th week EUS in the intervention group. Primary and secondary endpoints where complete drainage cessation at week 48 was fistula status per EUS, respectively. RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled: 11 control and 9 EUS guidance. At 24 weeks, 7/9 (78%) in EUS group and 3/11 (27%) in control group had drainage cessation (P = 0.04). This significant difference was lost at week 48 (P = 0.44). Three patients in the EUS and 1 in the control group had additional surgical intervention. Those in the EUS group had more rapid escalation of ADA dosing (P = 0.003). There was no difference in the change in PDAI at week 48 versus baseline (P = 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Rectal EUS-guided ADA therapy for CD perianal fistulas showed an initial benefit at 24 weeks, which was lost at week 48. This is likely due to small sample size and higher fistula closure in the controls. However, the faster rate of fistula resolution is a clinically significant finding.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease-unclassified (IBD-U) is diagnosed in approximately 10% of pediatric and adolescent onset IBD patients. The EUROKIDS registry (2004) initiated by the Porto IBD working group of ESPGHAN prospectively monitors diagnostic workup of newly diagnosed pediatric and adolescent onset IBD patients. We aimed to describe diagnostic workup, phenotype, and change of diagnosis over time in pediatric IBD-U patients. METHODS: Data were collected on children from 52 centers across 20 European countries and Israel, diagnosed with IBD from May 2005 through November 2013. Full endoscopy plus small bowel radiology was considered complete diagnostic workup. Participating centers reporting IBD-U patients were queried in 2014 for follow-up data. RESULTS: IBD-U was the provisional first diagnosis in 265 of 3461 children (7.7%) (91/158 [58%] with pancolitis; 140 [53%] male), diagnosed more frequently under the age of 10 (median age 12.3 years, 89 [34%] under 10 years). Half (48%) had undergone complete diagnostic workup. Lack of small bowel radiology was the prevailing reason for incomplete workup. As a result of reinvestigations (endoscopy in 54%, radiology in 38%) during a median follow-up of 5.7 years (interquartile range, 2.5-7.8), a change in diagnosis from IBD-U to Crohn's disease (12%) or ulcerative colitis (20%) was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Only half of patients reported as IBD-U in EUROKIDS had undergone complete diagnostic workup. Follow-up with reinvestigations resulted in a reduction of IBD-U rate to 5.6%. A diagnosis of IBD-U becomes less likely in case of complete diagnostic workup. Implementation of clear diagnostic criteria will further reduce the rate of IBD-U in the future.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Children with Crohn's disease often demonstrate nutritional recovery during primary therapy at diagnosis, but long-term nutritional support is sometimes necessary. Evidence to inform best nutritional practice including energy and micronutrient requirements is limited. The principal objective of this study was to determine how energy expenditure and physical activity vary with disease activity over the first year following diagnosis. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Twenty children were studied at diagnosis with Crohn's disease and were followed up over 1 year while receiving treatment according to national guidelines. The majority of children (13) were treated with exclusive enteral nutrition. At study visits, height, weight, bioelectrical impedance, resting energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry, tri-axial accelerometer and blood investigations were performed alongside clinical assessment. RESULTS: There was no significant effect of disease activity on resting energy expenditure (REE). Physical activity was greater after primary therapy (Z=3.31, P<0.01). Median wPCDAI fell from 58 at diagnosis to 7.5 after primary therapy and was 7.5 at 1 year. Weight s.d.s increased from -1.67 to -0.86 and lean index s.d.s increased from -2.93 to -1.64, although the increase was mostly in the first 2 months. Median height s.d.s was unchanged throughout this study. There was a significant association between dietary intake and weight gain (r=0.8 P<0.01) but not height gain. Persistent micronutrient deficits beyond diagnosis were seen for both iron and vitamin D. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that REE does not change significantly through different phases of disease activity, but physical activity is low at diagnosis. Children with Crohn's disease should be screened for deficiencies of iron and vitamin D.},

   abstract = {RAR-related orphan receptor-gammat (ROR-gammat) directs differentiation of proinflammatory T helper 17 (TH17) cells and is a potential therapeutic target in chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, ROR-gammat-dependent group 3 innate lymphoid cells ILC3s provide essential immunity and tissue protection in the intestine, suggesting that targeting ROR-gammat could also result in impaired host defense after infection or enhanced tissue damage. Here, we demonstrate that transient chemical inhibition of ROR-gammat in mice selectively reduces cytokine production from TH17 but not ILCs in the context of intestinal infection with Citrobacter rodentium, resulting in preserved innate immunity. Temporal deletion of Rorc (encoding ROR-gammat) in mature ILCs also did not impair cytokine response in the steady state or during infection. Finally, pharmacologic inhibition of ROR-gammat provided therapeutic benefit in mouse models of intestinal inflammation and reduced the frequency of TH17 cells but not ILCs isolated from primary intestinal samples of individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Collectively, these results reveal differential requirements for ROR-gammat in the maintenance of TH17 cell and ILC3 responses and suggest that transient inhibition of ROR-gammat is a safe and effective therapeutic approach during intestinal inflammation.},

Inflammation appears to be a major contributor in perpetuating a dysregulated gut microbiota. Although current drug therapies can significantly induce and maintain disease remission, there is no cure for these diseases. Nevertheless, ongoing human studies investigating dietary fibre interventions may potentially prove to exert beneficial outcomes for IBD. Postulated mechanisms include direct interactions with the gut mucosa through immunomodulation, or indirectly through the microbiome. Component species of the microbiome may degrade dietary-fibre polysaccharides and ferment the products to form short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate. Prebiotic dietary fibres may also act more directly by altering the composition of the microbiome. Longer term benefits in reducing the risk of more aggressive disease or colorectal cancer may require other dietary fibre sources such as wheat bran or psyllium. By critically examining clinical trials that have used dietary fibre supplements or dietary patterns containing specific types or amounts of dietary fibres, it may be possible to assess whether varying the intake of specific dietary fibres may offer an efficient treatment for IBD patients.},

   abstract = {Despite its importance in maintaining the health of the host, growing evidence suggests that gut microbiota may also be an important factor in the pathogenesis of various diseases. The composition of the microbiota can be influenced by many factors, including age, genetics, host environment, and diet. There are epidemiologic data associating diet with the development of inflammatory bowel disease as well as evidence that diet can influence both the form and the function of the microbiome. Based on this evidence, studies are now underway to examine the effect of defined formula diets, an effective therapeutic modality in Crohn's disease, on both the gut microbiome and its metabolome as a therapeutic probe. Diet has an impact upon both the composition and the function of the microbiota in part through small-molecule production that may influence the development of both immune-mediated and metabolic diseases. By comparing dietary intake, the gut microbiota, and the plasma metabolome in omnivores versus vegans, we provide evidence that the production of certain bacterial metabolites is constrained by the composition of the gut microbiota. In total, these results demonstrate the potential promise of dietary manipulation of the gut microbiota and its metabolome as a modality to both maintain health and treat disease.},

   abstract = {Aim. This study was performed to evaluate the additional enteral nutrition (EN) in the efficacy of infliximab (IFX) compared with the conventional therapy in managing Crohn's disease (CD) complicated with intestinal fistulas. Methods. A total of 42 CD with intestinal fistulas were randomly divided into infliximab treatment group (n = 20) and conventional therapy group (n = 22). We evaluated the laboratory indexes, Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), Crohn's disease simplified endoscopic score (SES-CD), and healing of fistula in the two groups before treatment, at 14 weeks, and at 30 weeks, respectively. Results. In the IFX treatment group, the CDAI score, the SES-CD, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein levels were significantly decreased during treatment compared with those before treatment. The body mass index and albumin levels were increased in both groups. Moreover, in the IFX treatment group, fistula healing was found in 8 at the 14th week and 18 at the 30th week, respectively, which was greater than that in the conventional therapy group. Conclusion. Our study suggested that infliximab combined with EN is an effective treatment for CD patients complicated with intestinal fistulas.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the 2 major phenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which are influenced by a complex interplay of immunological and genetic elements, though the precise etiology still remains unknown. With IBD developing into a globally prevailing disease, there is a need to explore new targets and a thorough understanding of the pathophysiological differences between the healthy and diseased gut could unearth new therapeutic opportunities. In this review, we provide an overview of the major aspects of IBD pathogenesis and thereafter present a comprehensive analysis of the gut pathophysiology leading to a discussion on some of the most promising targets and biologic therapies currently being explored. These include various gut proteins (CXCL-10, GATA-3, NKG2D, CD98, microRNAs), immune cells recruited to the gut (mast cells, eosinophils, toll-like receptors 2, 4), dysregulated proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, -13, -18, -21), and commensal microbiota (probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation). We also evaluate some of the emerging nonconventional therapies being explored in IBD treatment focusing on the latest developments in stem cell research, oral targeting of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, novel anti-inflammatory signaling pathway targeting, adenosine deaminase inhibition, and the beneficial effects of antioxidant and nutraceutical therapies. In addition, we highlight the growth of biologics and their targets in IBD by providing information on the preclinical and clinical development of over 60 biopharmaceuticals representing the state of the art in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease drug development.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are at increased risk for small bowel or colorectal cancers (colitis-associated cancers [CACs]). We compared the spectrum of genomic alterations in CACs with those of sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs) and investigated differences between CACs from patients with CD vs UC. METHODS: We studied tumor tissues from patients with CACs treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center or Weill Cornell Medical College from 2003 through 2015. We performed hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing analysis of >300 cancer-related genes to comprehensively characterize genomic alterations. RESULTS: We performed genomic analyses of 47 CACs (from 29 patients with UC and 18 with CD; 43 primary tumors and 4 metastases). Primary tumors developed in the ileum (n = 2), right colon (n = 18), left colon (n = 6), and rectosigmoid or rectum (n = 21). We found genomic alterations in TP53, IDH1, and MYC to be significantly more frequent, and mutations in APC to be significantly less frequent, than those reported in sporadic CRCs by The Cancer Genome Atlas or Foundation Medicine. We identified genomic alterations that might be targeted by a therapeutic agent in 17 of 47 (36%) CACs. These included the mutation encoding IDH1 R132; amplification of FGFR1, FGFR2, and ERBB2; and mutations encoding BRAF V600E and an EML4-ALK fusion protein. Alterations in IDH1 and APC were significantly more common in CACs from patients with CD than UC. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of CACs from 47 patients, we found significant differences in the spectrum of genomic alterations in CACs compared with sporadic CRCs. We observed a high frequency of IDH1 R132 mutations in patients with CD but not UC, as well as a high frequency of MYC amplification in CACs. Many genetic alterations observed in CACs could serve as therapeutic targets.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is controversy about whether levels of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and antidrug antibodies (ADAs) are accurate determinants of loss of response to therapy. We analyzed the association between trough levels of anti-TNF agents or ADAs and outcomes of interventions for patients with loss of response to infliximab or adalimumab. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of pediatric and adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease and suspected loss of response to anti-TNF agents treated at medical centers throughout Israel from October 2009 through February 2013. We examined the correlation between outcomes of different interventions and trough levels of drug or ADAs during loss of response. An additional subanalysis was performed including only patients with a definite inflammatory loss of response (clinical worsening associated with increased levels of C-reactive protein or fecal calprotectin, or detection of inflammation by endoscopy, fistula discharge, or imaging studies). RESULTS: Among 247 patients (42 with ulcerative colitis), there were 330 loss-of-response events (188 to infliximab and 142 to adalimumab). Trough levels of adalimumab greater than 4.5 mcg/mL and infliximab greater than 3.8 mcg/mL identified patients who failed to respond to an increase in drug dosage or a switch to another anti-TNF agent with 90% specificity; these were set as adequate trough levels. Adequate trough levels identified patients who responded to expectant management or out-of-class interventions with more than 75% specificity. Levels of antibodies against adalimumab >4 microgram per mL equivalent (mcg/mL-eq) or antibodies against infliximab >9 mcg/mL-eq identified patients who did not respond to an increased drug dosage with 90% specificity. Patients with high titers of ADAs had longer durations of response when anti-TNF agents were switched than when dosage was increased (P = .03; log-rank test), although dosage increases were more effective for patients with no or low titers of ADAs (P = .02). An analysis of definite inflammatory loss-of-response events (n = 244) produced similar results; patients with adequate trough levels had a longer duration of response when they switched to a different class of agent than when anti-TNF was optimized by either a dosage increase or by a switch within the anti-TNF class (P = .002; log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective analysis suggest that trough levels of drug or ADAs may guide therapeutic decisions for more than two-thirds of inflammatory bowel disease patients with either clinically suspected or definite inflammatory loss of response to therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is an intractable inflammatory bowel disease of unknown cause. Recent genome-wide association studies of CD in Korean and Japanese populations suggested marginal sharing of susceptibility loci between Caucasian and Asian populations. As the 7 identified loci altogether explain 5.31% of the risk for CD, the objective of this study was to identify additional CD susceptibility loci in the Korean population. METHODS: Using the ImmunoChip custom single-nucleotide polymorphism array designed for dense genotyping of 186 loci identified through GWAS, we analyzed 722 individuals with CD and 461 controls for 96,048 SNP markers in the discovery stage, followed by validation in an additional 948 affected individuals and 977 controls. RESULTS: We confirmed 6 previously reported loci in Caucasian: GPR35 at 2q37 (rs3749172; P = 5.30 x 10, odds ratio [OR] = 1.45), ZNF365 at 10q21 (rs224143; P = 2.20 x 10, OR = 1.38), ZMIZ1 at 10q22 (rs1250569; P = 3.05 x 10, OR = 1.30), NKX2-3 at 10q24 (rs4409764; P = 7.93 x 10, OR = 1.32), PTPN2 at 18p11 (rs514000; P = 9.00 x 10, OR = 1.33), and USP25 at 21q11 (rs2823256; P = 2.49 x 10, OR = 1.35), bringing the number of known CD loci (including 3 in the HLA) in Koreans to 15. The 6 additional loci increased the total genetic variance for CD risk from 5.31% to 7.27% in Koreans. CONCLUSIONS: Although the different genetic backgrounds of CD between Asian and Western countries has been well established for the major susceptibility genes, our findings of overlapping associations offer new insights into the genetic architecture of CD.},

IBD is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract and includes Crohn's Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). IBD has increasing incidence and prevalence in most of countries and becomes a global emerging disease. A westernized lifestyle or habits and some environmental factors have been found to contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD. The relevant risk factors include Smoking, hygiene hypothesis, microorganisms, appendectomy, medication, nutrition, and stress have all been found to be associated with the modality of IBD, but results are inconsistent on this issue in available studies. Therefore, more studies are required to identify and understand the environmental determinants of IBD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare condition that can be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to evaluate PSC and its association with IBD in children. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 13 pediatric patients (<18 years) with PSC treated at Asan Medical Center between June 1989 and December 2013. Clinical findings and long-term outcomes were investigated. During the same period, the incidence of PSC among IBD patients was evaluated among 600 Crohn disease (CD) and 210 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. RESULTS: All 13 study patients diagnosed with PSC also presented with IBD. Eleven boys and two girls with a median age of 15.0 years old (9.0-17.8 years) were included. The cumulative incidence of PSC for UC was 5.7% (12 of 210) and 0.2% for CD (1 of 600), respectively. PSC occurred during follow-up for IBD for five patients (38.5%) whereas, IBD developed during follow-up for PSC for two patients (15.4%), and was diagnosed during the initial work-up for PSC for 6 patients (46.2%). For the 77.3 month median follow-up period, 9/13 patients (69.2%), neither the clinical symptoms nor blood test results worsened. Two cases (15.4%) developed liver cirrhosis and underwent liver transplantation. Among 13 PSC patients with IBD, two (15.4%) developed colorectal cancer, and no one developed cholangiocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: All patients with PSC in this study had associated IBD. The incidence of PSC was not rare compared to reports in adults. PSC should be considered during the management of IBD and vice versa in children.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: In this study, we showed the beneficial effects of donkey milk (DM) on inflammatory damages, endogenous antimicrobial peptides levels and fecal microbiota profile in a mice model of Crohn's disease. Nowadays, new strategies of microbiome manipulations are on the light involving specific diets to induce and/or to maintain clinical remission. Interest of DM is explained by its high levels of antimicrobial peptides which confer it anti-inflammatory properties. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were orally administered with or without indomethacin for 5 days and co-treated with vehicle, DM or heated DM during 7 days. Intestinal length and macroscopic damage scores (MDSs) were determined; ileal samples were taken off for microscopic damage (MD), lysozyme immunostaining and mRNA alpha-defensin assessments. Ileal luminal content and fecal pellets were collected for lysozyme enzymatic activity and lipocalin-2 (LCN-2) evaluations. Fecal microbiota profiles were compared using a real-time quantitative PCR-based analysis. RESULTS: Administration of indomethacin caused an ileitis in mice characterized by (1) a decrease in body weight and intestinal length, (2) a significant increase in MDS, MD and LCN-2, (3) a reduction in both alpha-defensin mRNA expression and lysozyme levels in Paneth's cells reflected by a decrease in lysozyme activity in feces, and (4) a global change in relative abundance of targeted microbial communities. DM treatment significantly reduced almost of all these ileitis damages, whereas heated DM has no impact on ileitis. CONCLUSIONS: DM consumption exerts anti-inflammatory properties in mice by restoring the endogenous levels of antimicrobial peptides which contribute in turn to reduce microbiota imbalance.},

Epithelial cell extrusion, measured by counting gaps between epithelial cells, is higher in adult patients with Crohn disease (CD) than in controls. Our objectives were to compare epithelial gaps in the duodenum of IBD and non-IBD pediatric patients, to study the correlation between epithelial gaps, inflammation, and disease activity, and identify potential mechanisms. METHODS: Epithelial gap density of the duodenum was evaluated using probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy in 26 pediatric patients with IBD (16 CD, 10 ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 17 non-IBD controls during endoscopy. Epithelial gaps were correlated with serum inflammatory markers, disease activity indices, and intraepithelial lymphocytes. A panel of 10 inflammatory cytokines and expression of TNFAIP3 (A20; inhibits NF-kappabeta-induced inflammation) were analyzed in duodenal and ileal biopsies. RESULTS: Confocal imaging showed significantly higher epithelial gap density in patients with IBD, including UC. Interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-8 were higher in duodenal but not ileal biopsies of patients with UC. No significant correlation was present between C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, disease activity indices, and epithelial gaps in patients with UC. In patients with CD, C-reactive protein positively correlated with epithelial gaps. A20 expression in the duodenum was unchanged among non-IBD and IBD cases. CONCLUSIONS: Duodenal epithelial gaps are increased in pediatric patients with IBD (including UC) but are unrelated to inflammation. This suggests that altered epithelial barrier is an important systemic feature of pediatric IBD and is not only secondary to inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic pediatric disorders. Changes in vasculature are described in IBD but these could be secondary to inflammation and the role in pathogenesis is poorly understood. Assessing circulatory changes in typically unaffected sites in IBD (e.g., duodenum), when inflammation is absent, can identify vascular changes associated with pathogenesis. AIM: To measure capillary flow rates in duodenal mucosa using probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) during endoscopy in children with IBD. METHODS: Images of villi with visible blood vessels obtained using pCLE were captured as video sequences. Capillary flow rate (mm/s) was calculated by dividing the distance travelled by blood cells by the duration of the sequence. Flow rates were correlated with various clinical parameters. RESULTS: Forty-five patients (22 non-IBD, 14 CD, 9 UC) were included in the study. Duodenal capillary flow rates were significantly higher in UC patients (0.75 +/- 0.07 mm/s) as compared to non-IBD (0.57 +/- 0.03) and CD patients (0.65 +/- 0.04). There was no correlation between serum hemoglobin and albumin, disease activity indices, serum inflammatory markers, and capillary flow rates in patients. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows, for the first time, increased capillary blood flow in the duodenum of UC patients that was unrelated to inflammatory markers or disease activity. Thus, early vascular changes can be assessed using pCLE during endoscopy.},

The aim of this study was to compare the rate of endoscopic recurrence at the 6 month after ileocecal resection (ICR) in children with CD treated with azathioprine (AZA) between patients who received prior anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) therapy and those who were not administered this therapy. Moreover, we tried to identify the potential risk factors for disease recurrence and describe the schedule of long-term follow-up after surgery. METHODS: We prospectively collected data from pediatric patients with CD, who underwent ICR between October 2011 and June 2015 at our hospital and were treated with AZA monotherapy after ICR. We evaluated the endoscopic recurrence (Rutgeerts score) at the 6 month after ICR in all included patients. RESULTS: Among twenty-one included patients, 13 achieved endoscopic remission (Rutgeerts score < i2) at the 6 month after ICR. No difference was found between patients who received prior anti-TNF-alpha therapy and those who did not. We did not find any clinically relevant factors associated with endoscopic recurrence rate at the 6 month. CONCLUSION: Prior anti-TNF-alpha therapy does not seem to be a strong risk factor for endoscopic recurrence within 6 months after ICR. Further studies on large sample of patients are needed to identify potential predictors of disease recurrence.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: IBD is a group of complex, systemic disorders associated with intestinal inflammation and extraintestinal manifestations. Recent studies revealed Mendelian forms of IBD, which contributed significantly to our understanding of disease pathogenesis and the heritability of IBD. DESIGN: We performed exome sequencing in a family with Crohn's disease (CD) and severe autoimmunity, analysed immune cell phenotype and function in affected and non-affected individuals, and performed in silico and in vitro analyses of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) structure and function. RESULTS: A novel missense variant was identified in CTLA4 encoding CTLA-4, a coinhibitory protein expressed by T cells and required for regulation of T cell activation. The residue affected by the mutation, CTLA-4 Tyr60, is evolutionarily highly conserved, and the identified Y60C variant is predicted to affect protein folding and structural stability and demonstrated to cause impaired CTLA-4 dimerisation and CD80 binding. Intestinal inflammation and autoimmunity in carriers of CTLA-4 Y60C exhibit incomplete penetrance with a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic carrier status to fatal autoimmunity and intestinal inflammation. In a clinically affected CTLA-4 Y60C carrier, T cell proliferation was increased in vitro and associated with an increased ratio of memory to naive T cells in vivo, consistent with impaired regulation of T cell activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the concept that variants in CTLA4 provide the basis for a novel Mendelian form of early-onset CD associated with systemic autoimmunity. Incomplete penetrance of autoimmunity further indicates the presence of other genetic and/or environmental modifiers.},

However, the immunoregulatory and epithelial barrier protective properties of C-BF have not been reported. Inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, can lead to colon cancer, the third most common malignant tumor. The objective is to develop the new found cathelicidin-BF as a therapeutic to patients of ulcerative colitis. The morphology of the colon epithelium was observed by H&E staining; apoptosis index and infiltration of inflammatory cells in colonic epithelium were measured by TUNEL and immunohistochemistry; the expression level of endogenous mCRAMP was analyzed by immunofluorescence; and phosphorylation of the transcription factors c-jun and NF-kappaB in colon were analyzed by Western blot. Our results showed that the morphology of the colon epithelium in the C-BF+DSS group was improved compared with the DSS group. Apoptosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in colonic epithelium were also significantly attenuated in the C-BF+DSS group compared with the DSS group, and the expression level of endogenous mCRAMP in the DSS group was significantly higher than other groups. DSS-induced phosphorylation level of c-jun and NF-kappaB while C-BF effectively inhibited phosphorylation of NF-kappaB (p65). The barrier protective effect of C-BF was still excellent. In conclusion, C-BF effectively attenuated inflammation and improved disrupted barrier function. Notably, this is the first report to demonstrate that C-BF attenuates DSS-induced UC both through the regulation of intestinal immune and retention of barrier function, and the exact pathway was through NF-kappaB.},

   abstract = {Poor preoperative nutritional status for individuals with Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with intra-abdominal septic complications (IASCs). The present study aimed to investigate the association of the common nutrition indices serum albumin and body mass index (BMI) with IASCs. Sixty-four CD patients who had received elective intestinal operations were retrospectively investigated. Among these patients, 32 had received individualized fortified nutrition support. IASCs occurred in 7 patients (10.9%). Compared with non-IASC patients, IASC patients had a lower BMI (17.6 +/- 2.7 vs 15.6 +/- 1.3 kg/m, P = 0.048). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve according to the BMI-based IASC prediction was 0.772 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.601-0.944; P = 0.020) with an optimum diagnostic cutoff value of 16.2 kg/m. A BMI < 16.2 kg/m significantly increased the risk of developing an IASC (odds ratio [OR], 10.286; 95% CI, 1.158-91.386). Even after correction with the simplified CD activity index (CDAI), a low BMI level remained associated with IASCs (OR, 7.650; 95% CI, 0.808-72.427; P = 0.076). Serum albumin was not associated with IASCs. Although the fortified nutrition support group had an albumin level comparable to the control group, this group had a higher simplified CDAI score, a lower BMI level, and a comparable incidence rate of IASCs. Thus, BMI more accurately reflects the basic preoperative nutritional status of CD patients than serum albumin. BMI can aid in guiding preoperative nutrition support and judging the appropriate operation time for CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia has been proposed to be a prognostic factor of outcomes for various diseases but has not been applied to Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to assess the impact of sarcopenia on postoperative outcomes after bowel resection in patients with CD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Abdominal computed tomography images within 30 days before bowel resection in 114 patients with CD between May 2011 and March 2014 were assessed for sarcopenia as well as visceral fat areas and subcutaneous fat areas. The impact of sarcopenia on postoperative outcomes was evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Of 114 patients, 70 (61.4%) had sarcopenia. Patients with sarcopenia had a lower body mass index, lower preoperative levels of serum albumin, and more major complications (15.7% vs 2.3%, P = .027) compared with patients without sarcopenia. Moreover, predictors of major postoperative complications were sarcopenia (odds ratio [OR], 9.24; P = .04) and a decreased skeletal muscle index (1.11; P = .023). Preoperative enteral nutrition (OR, 0.13; P = .004) and preoperative serum albumin level >35 g/L (0.19; P = .017) were protective factors in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of sarcopenia is high in patients with CD requiring bowel resection. It significantly increases the risk of major postoperative complications and has clinical implications with respect to nutrition management before surgery for CD.},

This study evaluated body composition in adult patients with UC and the associations of body composition with disease activity and surgical intervention. METHODS: This study included 99 patients with UC, 105 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 60 controls. Skeletal muscle area (SMA), visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) of the third lumbar vertebrae were evaluated by abdominal computed tomography. The effects of medical therapy and surgery on body composition in UC patients were determined. RESULTS: Sarcopenia was more frequent in UC patients (27.3%) than in controls (8.3%), but less frequent than in CD patients (59.0%). The prevalence of sarcopenia was significantly higher (33.8% vs. 4.5%, p < 0.001), and SMA (144.26 vs. 182.32 cm2, p < 0.001), skeletal muscle index (SMI) (52.22 vs. 65.52 cm2/m2, p < 0.001) significantly lower, in UC patients with high (>/=6) than low (<6) Mayo score, but SFA and VFA were similar. The prevalence of sarcopenia and alterations in body composition were reversed, along with UC disease activity, following medical treatment or surgery. SMA and SMI correlated significantly with disease activity in UC patients. Multivariate analysis showed that sarcopenia (odds ratio, 8.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.80-40.10; p = 0.007) was a negative predictor of high Mayo score in UC patients. Sarcopenic patients with UC had high probability of need for colectomy in Kaplan-Meier survival curves. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is associated with high disease activity and poor clinical outcome in UC patients. Medical treatment and colectomy have positive effects on sarcopenia and skeletal muscle depletion.},

We hypothesized that intra-abdominal sepsis (IAS), but not penetrating behavior itself, contributes to postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing bowel resection for CD.Patients who underwent surgery from April 2010 to April 2014 were retrospectively identified from a prospectively maintained database. Demographic information and preoperative and operative data were collected. The outcomes following surgery in patients who had penetrating disease with or without IAS versus nonpenetrating CD were compared.Of 288 patients, 180 had penetrating CD, including 54 who had IAS. Preoperative characteristics were similar between the groups, except for serum albumin, abdominal drainage, and prior bowel resection. Patients with penetrating CD with IAS were more likely to have a stoma, surgical site complications, postoperative IAS complications, and major complications than patients with penetrating CD without IAS or nonpenetrating CD. There were no significant differences between patients with penetrating CD without IAS and nonpenetrating CD. The postoperative outcome was strengthened after propensity-score matching analysis. Moreover, penetrating CD with IAS (odds ratio [OR], 13.034; P = 0.004) is a risk predictor for major postoperative complications, and preoperative serum albumin (OR, 0.095; P = 0.002) and preoperative enteral nutrition (OR, 0.203, P = 0.049) are protective.Penetrating CD without IAS did not adversely affect postoperative outcome after bowel resection compared with penetrating CD with IAS. These results may revise the notion that all patients with penetrating CD have worse postoperative complications.},

METHODS: Sixty-one patients diagnosed with CD were enrolled in this study. They were given only EN (enteral nutritional suspension, TPF, non-elemental diet) support for 4 wk, without any treatment with corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, infliximab or by surgical operation. Body composition statistics such as weight, body mass index, skeletal muscle mass (SMM), fat mass, protein mass and inflammation indexes such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and CD activity index (CDAI) were recorded before and after EN support. RESULTS: The 61 patients were divided into three groups according to CDAI before and after EN support: A (active phase into remission via EN, n=21), B (remained in active phase before and after EN, n=19) and C (in remission before and after EN, n=21). Patients in group A had a significant increase in SMM (22.11+/-4.77 kg vs 23.23+/-4.49 kg, P=0.044), protein mass (8.01+/-1.57 kg vs 8.44+/-1.45 kg, P=0.019) and decrease in resting energy expenditure (REE) per kilogram (27.42+/-5.01 kcal/kg per day vs 22.62+/-5.45 kcal/kg per day, P<0.05). There was no significant difference between predicted and measured REE in active CD patients according to the Harris-Benedict equation. There was no linear correlation between the measured REE and CRP, ESR or CDAI in active CD patients. CONCLUSION: EN could decrease the hypermetabolism in active CD patients by reducing the inflammatory response.},

In experimental models, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid-has been demonstrated to be useful in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease through inhibition of the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway. However, the impact of DHA on autophagy in the colon remains unclear. METHODS: Mice were divided into 3 groups: wild type (placebo), the interleukin 10 knockout group (IL-10-/-, placebo), and the DHA group (IL-10-/-, DHA). DHA was administered to IL-10-/- mice by gavage at a dosage of 35.5 mg/kg/d for 2 weeks. The severity of colitis, expression of proinflammatory cytokines, expression/distribution of LC3B, and mTOR signaling pathway were evaluated in the proximal colon tissues collected from all mice at the end of the experiment. RESULTS: DHA administration ameliorated experimental colitis in the IL-10-/- mice, as demonstrated by decreased proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma), reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells, and lowered histologic scores of the proximal colon mucosa. Moreover, in the DHA-treated mice, enhanced autophagy was observed to be associated with (1) increased expression and restoration of the distribution integrity of LC3B in the colon and (2) inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: This study showed that DHA therapy could attenuate experimental chronic colitis in IL-10-/- mice by triggering autophagy via inhibition of the mTOR pathway.},

The tight junction (TJ) changes and death of epithelial cells caused by intestinal inflammation play an important role in the development of CD. DHA, a long-chain PUFA, has been shown to be helpful in treating inflammatory bowel disease in experimental models by inhibiting the NF-kappaB pathway. The present study aimed at investigating the specific effect of DHA on the intestinal barrier function in IL-10-deficient mice. IL-10-deficient mice (IL-10(-/-)) at 16 weeks of age with established colitis were treated with DHA (i.g. 35.5 mg/kg per d) for 2 weeks. The severity of their colitis, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, epithelial gene expression, the distributions of TJ proteins (occludin and zona occludens (ZO)-1), and epithelial apoptosis in the proximal colon were measured at the end of the experiment. DHA treatment attenuated the established colitis and was associated with reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells in the colonic mucosa, lower mean histological scores and decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-17, TNF-alpha and interferon-gamma). Moreover, enhanced barrier function was observed in the DHA-treated mice that resulted from attenuated colonic permeability, rescued expression and corrected distributions of occludin and ZO-1. The results of the present study indicate that DHA therapy may ameliorate experimental colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice by improving the intestinal epithelial barrier function.},

We investigated the expression of GPR43/FFAR2 in the colon from Crohn's disease patients and whether dietary fiber in enteral nutrition increases GPR43+ polymorphonuclear infiltration in mucosa. Segments of ascending colon and white blood cells from peripheral blood were obtained from 46 Crohn's disease patients and 10 colon cancer patients. The Crohn's disease patients were grouped by the activity of disease (active or remission) and enteral nutrition with or without dietary fiber. Histological feature, expression and location of GPR43/FFAR2 and level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukine-6 (IL-6) and myeloperoxidase were assessed. The results of hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry staining revealed that the infiltration of immune cells, including GPR43+ PMN, was more severe in active Crohn's disease patients who consumed normal food or enteral nutrition with dietary fiber than in remission patients and colon cancer patients. This finding was supported by the results of GPR43 and myeloperoxidase expression. Active Crohn's disease (CD) patients who consumed enteral nutrition without dietary fiber exhibited severe immune cell infiltration similar to the other active CD patients, but GPR43+ PMNs were rarely observed. The level of TNF-alpha mRNA in active Crohn's disease patients was higher than those of the other patients. In conclusion, the use of dietary fiber in enteral nutrition by active Crohn's disease patients might increase GPR43+ PMNs infiltration in colon mucosa. This effect was not observed in Crohn's disease patients in remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bowel resection is required in the majority of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) during their lifetime. The Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) is a useful tool for predicting postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing cancer surgery. We examined the ability of the PNI to predict short-term outcomes in patients with CD-related bowel resection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients who underwent bowel resection for CD were retrospectively enrolled in the study. The PNI was calculated as follows: 10 x serum albumin (g/dL) + 0.005 x total lymphocyte count (per mL). Patients were divided into 2 groups: PNI <40 (n = 30) and PNI >/=40 (n = 43). RESULTS: A significant difference was found in body mass index (17.9 +/- 2.4 vs 19.2 +/- 2.2, P = .018) between the 2 groups. Postoperative overall and infectious complications occurred more frequently in patients with PNI <40 than in those with PNI >/=40 (50.0% and 46.7% vs 23.3% and 16.3%, P = .018 and P = .005, respectively). In the univariate analysis, body mass index <18.5, penetrating behavior, open surgery, and PNI <40 were associated with an increased risk of overall complications and infectious complications. In the multivariate analysis, only PNI <40 was an independent prognostic factor for infectious complications (odds ratio: 3.846, 95% confidence interval: 1.145-12.821). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative PNI is a useful predictor of postoperative infectious complications in patients with CD-related bowel resection.},

   abstract = {Nutritional therapy cannot only improve nutritional status but also reduce bowel inflammation in Crohn disease (CD). The benefits of preoperative nutritional therapy on outcomes of surgery for CD have been demonstrated. However, the ideal end-points of preoperative nutrition in CD remain elusive. We conducted this study to figure out whether improvement of malnutrition or reduction of inflammation is the better end-point of preoperative nutrition for CD. This was a prospective, randomized study. All patients enrolled received preoperative nutrition with different end-points (improvement of malnutrition, IOM, or reduction of inflammation, ROI). The end-points were defined using serum albumin and body weight gain, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP), respectively. Postoperative complications, rate of fecal diversion, and postoperative recurrence of the disease were compared. A total of 108 patients were randomized and 91 patients (44 in IOM group and 47 in ROI group) completed this study. It took 25.57 +/- 11.68 days to achieve ROI and 45.29 +/- 18.47 days for IOM (P = 0.0023). After nutritional therapy, serum CRP, CDAI, and serum albumin in both groups improved significantly. But patients in the IOM group had a higher albumin level and body weight gain compared with ROI group (P = 0.0026, P < 0.0001). When comparing postoperative complications, rate of fecal diversion, and postoperative recurrence, no significant differences were noted. Compared with IOM, ROI as the end-point of preoperative nutrition had the same benefits on operative outcomes in CD patients undergoing resection, but could be achieved in a shorter time (NCT01540942).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy and safety of the application of enteral nutrition (EN) in gastrointestinal disease in children, and to explore the possibility of the implementation of family EN. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of disease spectrum, EN approach, preparation, speed and time as well as adverse reactions and outcomes in 47 pediatric patients with gastrointestinal disease underwent EN therapy during July 2014 to March 2015. The nutrition indicators before and after EN therapy were compared by paired t-test. RESULT: A total of 47 patients were selected, 27 male (57%) and 20 female (43%), aged 0.8 (0.3, 4.0) years, 9 with mechanical or chemical damage to the esophagus, 7 with inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), 6 with chronic diarrhea, 5 with acute pancreatitis, 3 with acute diarrhea and severe malnutrition, 3 with short bowel syndrome, 3 with improper feeding, 3 with feeding difficulties, 3 with protein losing enteropathy, 2 with post-enterostomy, 2 with enterocolitis, 1 with gastroesophageal reflux, were diagnosed. Of 47 cases, 22 were given oral nutrition, 28 were fed with nasogastric tube and 4 with nasojejunal tube feeding, 2 with percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy tube feeding for each. In these tube-feeding cases, 20 cases were treated with continuous infusion and 21 cases with intermittent infusion. Eleven cases were fed with amino acid formula; 21 cases took the choice of peptide formulations; 16 cases chose whole protein formula, including six cases who chose 3.3-4.2 kJ/ml higher energy density formula, 10 cases selected common energy density formula including breast milk. Twenty-one cases suffered from different degrees of adverse reactions, including vomiting in 7 cases, abdominal pain and bloating in 3, diarrhea in 12, secondary respiratory infections in 5. Five patients were discharged after giving up of treatment by parents due to poor efficacy on primary disease; 3 cases were transferred to other departments for further treatment; 15 cases were discharged with a feeding tube for family nutrition and specialist out-patient treatment. The rest 24 cases were all improved and discharged. There were significant differences in nutrition indicators before and after EN, weight-for-age Z score (WAZ)(-2.3+/-1.9 vs. -1.9+/-1.8, t=4.156, P=0.000), weight-for-height Z score (WHZ)(-1.9+/-1.7 vs. -1.2+/-1.5, t=3.714, P=0.001), albumin ((35+/-9)g/L vs.(39+/-6) g/L, t=3.017, P=0.005) and prealbumin ((0.11+/-0.05)g/L vs.(0.18+/-0.07)g/L, t=5.144, P=0.000). CONCLUSION: EN is suitable for a variety of children's digestive diseases, which can improve the nutritional status of the patients and was safe for clinical application. As the implementation of EN is simple and has good compliance, family EN is proven to be feasible.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and continuing colonic inflammation is considered an important risk factor in the development of colorectal cancer. Our previous studies showed that beetroot (Beta vulgaris var. rubra) products and their major component betanin modulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) stimulated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils of healthy volunteers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of betanin on the oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis in neutrophils isolated from blood of patients with inflammatory bowel disease--ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The results were compared with those obtained in colon carcinoma-derived Caco-2 cells. Betanin treatment at the concentration of 100 muM for 24 h increased DNA damage assessed by comet assay in IBD patients' neutrophils. A similar effect although less pronounced was observed in Caco-2 cells. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with H2O2 caused a 4-fold increase of DNA strand breaks in comparison to untreated cells, but pre-treatment with betanin reduced DNA damage in these cells. Betanin also induced procaspase-3 cleavage and caspase-3 activity accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, indicating its pro-apoptotic activity. These results suggest that betanin may support mechanisms that lead to the release of ROS and apoptotic cell death. In this way betanin may exert anti-inflammatory and potentially cancer preventive activity.},

   abstract = {Endocytosis is a fundamental cell biological process, which carries out essential functions in a polarized epithelial cell such as enterocytes provided with a huge surface area of the brush border membrane. Major tasks of enterocytes, which are regulated by endocytic signals, are digestion and absorption of nutrients and drugs/pharmacological agents, barrier permeability to microorganism, toxins and antigens, and transcytotic crosstalk between intestinal lumen and lamina propria cells with access to the circulation.Investigations on inflammatory bowel diseases such as food allergy, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis focus on immune processes originating within enterocytes as antigen presenting cells. Thus the initiation of oral tolerance, that is, the binding of food antigens to MHC class II proteins, might be localized within late endosomes of enterocytes. Furthermore, the late endosomal compartment of enterocytes seems to be involved in the processing of luminal antigens during the pathogenesis of celiac disease and inflammatory bowel diseases. Investigations of inherited diseases such as microvillus inclusion disease have revealed a pathogenetic defect in the autophagocytotic and/or recycling pathway of enterocytes.Our progress in the cell and molecular biological understanding of the endocytosis and the methodical opportunities of translational research offer now new therapeutic options for patients suffering from endocytosis-related diseases of enterocytes.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Infliximab (IFX) has become a mainstay of therapy for children with Crohn disease (CD). Despite medical advances, many children with CD, however, still require operative interventions. The risk of complications following resection in children treated with IFX remains largely unknown. We compare surgical outcomes stratified by IFX therapy in a cohort of children with CD who require bowel resection. METHODS: We reviewed the postoperative complications in 123 children with CD who underwent bowel resection with primary anastomosis at our institution between 1977 and 2011. Demographics, medications, types of operations, and inpatient courses were analyzed. Complications and length of stay were compared based on medical therapy. RESULTS: Overall, the postoperative complication rate was 13%. Of the 123 surgical cases, 24 children had received IFX before their operation. In the children treated with IFX, we identified 3 major complications, including anastomotic leak, acute renal failure, and intraabdominal abscess. There were 9 major complications in the non-IFX group, including infections (2), intraabdominal abscesses (2), bowel obstruction, shock, supraventricular tachycardia, phlegmon, and anastomotic stricture. No significant differences in complication rates or postoperative lengths of stay were identified between those who did or did not receive IFX. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, surgical procedures in children and young adults treated with IFX were not associated with an increased number of complications or prolonged length of stay. Given that postoperative complications are infrequent in children, larger multicenter studies may be required to determine whether IFX therapy increases the risk of surgical complications in pediatric CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adult studies suggest antibodies to infliximab (ATI) correlate with loss of response in inflammatory bowel disease but pediatric data are limited. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of trough infliximab levels and ATI in 134 pediatric and young adult patients receiving infliximab. At the time serum was obtained demographics, disease phenotype, duration of infliximab therapy, use of combination therapy (methotrexate or 6-mercaptopurine with infliximab), and surgery were recorded. RESULTS: Assays were performed on 134 subjects currently receiving infliximab (85 male; mean age, 17.3 +/- 4.3 years; 114 Crohn's disease and 20 ulcerative colitis). Infliximab use ranged from 12 days to 12 years: median 2.0 (interquartile range [1.1-4.3]) years. Twenty-seven of 134 (20%) patients had ATI >/=5 U/mL. Of patients with ATI >/=5 U/mL, 59% had infliximab levels <5 mug/mL, compared with 14% of patients with ATI <5 U/mL (P < 0.001). Ten (7%) patients (9 Crohn's disease, 1 ulcerative colitis) underwent bowel resections after beginning infliximab infusions. Sixty percent who underwent surgery had ATI >/=12 U/mL; in contrast, only 8% of patients who did not undergo surgery had ATI >/=12 U/mL (P = 0.01). At the time of serum sampling, 50 (37%) patients were receiving combination therapy, compared with 84 (63%) on infliximab alone. Combination therapy at the time of serum sampling did not correlate with either increase infliximab levels or lower ATI compared with infliximab monotherapy. However, prior immunomodulator use was associated with lower antibody levels (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: ATI correlates with reduction in infliximab level and a higher risk of surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR), which exists mainly in the liver, is a D-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase that plays a critical role in the formation of primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2). Here, we investigated GRHPR expression and its potential role in both human Crohn's disease (CD) and experimental colitis. Murine experimental colitis models were established by administration of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS). As shown by Western blot, significant up-regulation of GRHPR was found in TNBS-treated mice as compared with normal controls. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) also showed increased GRHPR expression, and the molecule was located in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). This phenomenon also occurred in patients with Crohn's disease. Besides, in an in vitro study, human IEC line HT-29 cells cultured with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were used to evaluate the changes in expression of GRHPR. Moreover, overexpression of GRHPR was accompanied by active caspase-3 and cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) accumulation. Furthermore, knock-down GRHPR could inhibit the accumulation of active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP as shown by Western blot in TNF-alpha treated HT-29 cells. Flow cytometry assay indicated that interference of GRHPR led to increasing apoptosis of IECs. These data suggested that GRHPR might exert its pro-apoptosis function in IECs. Thus, GRHPR might play an important role in regulating IECs apoptosis, and might be a potential therapeutic target for CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mucosal healing (MH) is a vital early endpoint in management of Crohn's disease (CD). MH depends on endoscopic assessment and there is increasing interest in non-invasive proxies, Pediatric Crohn's Disease activity Index (PDCAI), C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FC). These proxies must be validated against endoscopic disease activity (SES-CD) at diagnosis and after induction therapy in well characterized cohorts of children with CD. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 24 newly diagnosed children (<16 yr) with luminal CD quantifiable on complete ileo-colonoscopy had paired PCDAI, CRP, FC and SES-CD at diagnosis and after 8 weeks therapy with exclusive enteral nutrition or steroids. RESULTS: At diagnosis: PCDAI had poor correlation (r = 0.33); CRP (r = 0.54) and FC (r = 0.46) had moderate correlation with SES-CD. After induction therapy: 11/24 had inactive disease (SES-CD 0-2); PCDAI (r = 0.34) and CRP (0.28) had poor correlation with SES-CD, many children with SES-CD >/=3 having normalization of both PCDAI and CRP. FC had good correlation (r = 0.50) but many with SES-CD 0-2 had FC >200 mug/gm stool. FC<500 (positive likelihood ratio, 3.2) and FC drop >50% (positive likelihood ratio, 3.8) had greater predictive value for inactive disease. Composite PCDAI (<10), CRP (<5 mg/dl) & FC <500 mug had excellent Negative LR (0.2) predicting inactive disease. CONCLUSIONS: PCDAI is unreliable for endoscopic disease severity assessment. Only FC correlates with endoscopic activity after therapy but cut off <200 mug is too high for defining endoscopic recovery in children. Composite normalized PCDAI, CRP and FC <500 mug should be considered the non-invasive endpoint for treatment response in pediatric CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bile salts likely contribute to liver injury in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) is a bile salt-induced enterokine with hepatoprotective potential as it suppresses de novo bile salt synthesis. Here, we evaluated the bile salt receptor FXR/FGF19 gut-liver axis in PSC and PBC patients. METHODS: Fasted patients with PSC (n = 12) and PBC (n = 10), and healthy controls (HC; n = 10) were orally challenged with the natural FXR agonist chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA 15 mg/kg). Blood was sampled hourly until 8 h afterwards. Serum FGF19 and bile salt excursions were determined. Serum levels of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), reflecting bile salt synthesis, were measured as a biomarker of FGF19 response. RESULTS: Baseline serum FGF19 levels were comparable between groups, while fasted bile salt levels in PSC patients were elevated. Upon CDCA challenge, HC and PBC patients showed a serum FGF19 peak after 4 h followed by a decline. PSC patients showed a prolonged and elevated serum FGF19 response up to 8 h, combined with a sustained serum elevation of CDCA and other bile salts. In general, C4 levels declined following FGF19 elevation. In PSC patients with less favorable prognosis, baseline C4 levels were drastically suppressed and did not further decline. CONCLUSION: Following an oral CDCA challenge, PSC patients showed an impaired clearance of CDCA and a prolonged serum FGF19 response. FXR agonist therapy in PSC could cause prolonged exposure to elevated levels of FGF19, and we propose careful monitoring for detrimental side effects in patient studies.},

   abstract = {IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), where CD (Crohn's disease) and UC (ulcerative colitis) represent the two main forms, are chronic inflammatory conditions of the intestine. Macrophages play a central role in IBD pathogenesis and are regulated by major differentiation factors such as CSF-1 (colony-stimulating factor 1) in homoeostasis and inflammation. IL (interleukin)-34 has recently been discovered as a second ligand for CSF-1R (CSF-1 receptor). However, expression and involvement of IL-34 in IBD remain unknown. In the present paper, we investigated the expression of IL34, CSF1 and their shared receptor CSF1R in normal human ileum and colon, in inflamed and non-inflamed tissues of CD and UC patients, and in a mouse model of experimental colitis. We found distinct expression patterns of IL34 and CSF1 in ileum and colon, with higher IL34 in ileum and, in contrast, higher CSF1 in colon. Furthermore, IL34 and CSF1 expression was increased with inflammation in IBD patients and in experimental colitis. In humans, infiltrating cells of the lamina propria and intestinal epithelial cells expressed IL-34, and TNF-alpha (tumour necrosis factor alpha) regulated IL-34 expression in intestinal epithelial cells through the NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) pathway. These data demonstrate the expression pattern of IL-34 in ileum and colon and suggest IL-34 as a new modulator of inflammation in IBD.},
