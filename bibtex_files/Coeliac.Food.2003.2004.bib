   abstract = {InKine Pharmaceutical Co. is developing an oral compound, CBP 1011, for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) [Hematrol] and for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disorders, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (Colirest). This profile has been selected from R&D Insight, a pharmaceutical intelligence database produced by Adis International Ltd. CBP 1011 or medroxyprogesterone, is a progesterone agonist and inhibits pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). CBP 1011 was originally developed by CorBec Pharmaceuticals, which in 1997 was aquired by Panax and then intergrated into InKine Pharmaceuticals. According to a company spokesperson, InKline is pursuing outlicensing opportunities for Hematrol since the company's current commercial focus is on gastrointestinal products. In June 2000, InKine announced the completion of a study comparing the bioavailability of a commercially viable tablet formulation of CBP 1011 to the original capsule formulation that is currently being used in the company's phase III studies in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Preliminary results from this study indicate that the bioavailability of the tablet formulation does not differ significantly from that of the capsule formulation. The trial enrolled ITP patients (i) who are HIV positive, (ii) who are chronic ITP sufferers despite having had a splenectomy, (iii) who are older, or (iv) who have less severe thrombocytopenia. In preclinical trials, CBP 1011 was shown to decrease lymphocyte infiltration into the bowel compared with the control. Studies also show that it possibly offers safety benefits over steroid therapies. In June 2001, InKine commenced enrolment for a pivotal phase III trial in the treatment of Crohn's disease. This randomised, double-blind trial will enrol approximately 250 patients and will compare two doses of CBP 1011 (400 and 1000mg) with placebo. In April 2003, the US Patent and Trademark Office granted InKine Pharmaceutical a 'Notice of Allowance' for the 'Method of Treating Inflammatory Conditions with Progesterone or Progesterone Analogs'. This patent for medroxyprogesterone (Colirest) provides InKine patent protection for the use of Colirest in treating patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, proctitis, microscopic colitis, allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis, food allergies, drug-induced oesophagitis, coeliac disease, recurrent polyps and haemorrhoids. The patent protection also covers Colirest in a variety of delivery forms such as tablet, enema, suppository, foam, gel, ointment and suspension.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide health care providers, patients, and the general public with a responsible assessment of currently available data regarding celiac disease. PARTICIPANTS: A non-DHHS, non-advocate 13-member panel representing the fields of internal medicine, gastroenterology, medical genetics, pathology, endocrinology, nutrition, and a consumer representative. In addition, 19 experts in related fields presented data to the panel and to the conference audience. EVIDENCE: Presentations by experts; a systematic review of the medical literature provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; and an extensive bibliography of celiac disease research papers, prepared by the National Library of Medicine. Scientific evidence was given precedence over clinical anecdotal experience. CONFERENCE PROCESS: Answering pre-determined questions, the panel drafted its statement based on scientific evidence presented in open forum and on the published scientific literature. The draft statement was read in its entirety on the final day of the conference and circulated to the audience for comment. The panel then met in executive session to consider the comments received, and released a revised statement later that day at http://consensus.nih.gov. This statement is an independent report of the panel and is not a policy statement of the NIH or the Federal Government. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated intestinal disorder with protean manifestations. Celiac disease is common, affecting 0.5 to 1.0 percent of the general population of the United States, but is greatly underdiagnosed. There are now specific and sensitive serologic tests available to aid in diagnosis that need to be more widely applied. The treatment of celiac disease remains a lifelong gluten-free diet, which results in remission for most individuals. The classic presentation of diarrhea and malabsorption is less common, and atypical and silent presentations are increasing. Most individuals are being seen by primary care providers and a broad range of specialists. Therefore, heightened awareness of this disease is imperative. Education of physicians, registered dietitians, and other health providers is needed. The panel recommends the following: (1) Education of physicians, dietitians, nurses, and the public about celiac disease by a trans-National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiative, to be led by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), in association with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; (2) Standardization of serologic tests and pathologic criteria for the diagnosis of celiac disease; (3) Adoption of a standard definition of a gluten-free diet based on objective evidence such as that being developed by the American Dietetic Association; (4) Development of an adequate testing procedure for gluten in foods and definition of standards for gluten-free foods in the United States to lay the foundation for rational food labeling; (5) Formation of a federation of celiac disease societies, celiac disease interest groups, individuals with celiac disease and their families, physicians, dietitians, and other health care providers for the advancement of education, research, and advocacy for individuals with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {In the last years our knowledge on epidemiology of celiac disease has increased: there is a wide spectrum of its clinical presentation (classical, atypical, silent and latent forms of celiac disease), and of its pathological mucosal intestinal features, which range from early and mild pictures to severe villous atrophy (Marsh stages). In addition, a strong genetic component, associated with the susceptibility to the disease (HLA and non HLA genes), has been found. This knowledge, together with the availability of new high sensitive and specific serological tests (antigliadin, antiendomysium and antitransglutaminase antibodies), has led us to the realization that celiac disease is the most common food intolerance in the world, involving genetically predisposed individuals consuming gluten-containing cereals in their diet. So, today it is well known that celiac disease is a common disorder not only in Europe but also in populations of European ancestry (North and South Americas, Australia), in North Africa, in the Middle East and in South Asia, where until a few years ago it was historically considered extremely rare. Therefore, celiac disease is spread worldwide as in a common "Global Village", and greater levels of awareness and attention on gluten intolerance are needed, both in the Old and in the New World.},

   abstract = {Iron deficiency anaemia is generally considered a sign of occult bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, and standard care therefore includes evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract to rule out possible bleeding sites. However, it is often overlooked that iron deficiency anaemia may be the result of an imbalance between iron loss and iron intake, and may also be due to reduced absorption of iron from food, i.e., coeliac disease. The absorption of alimentary iron is not a simple process and the stomach plays a major role in this process of iron "digestion". This review presents evidence linking iron deficiency anaemia to gastric conditions that lead to reduced acid secretion, such as, for example, gastric surgery, atrophic body gastritis and Helicobacter pylori gastritis.},

We have evaluated inflammation and the mucosal immune response to gliadin in the jejunum of patients with type 1 diabetes. Small intestinal biopsies from 17 children with type 1 diabetes without serological markers of celiac disease and from 50 age-matched control subjects were examined by immunohistochemistry. In addition, biopsies from 12 type 1 diabetic patients and 8 control subjects were cultured with gliadin or ovalbumin peptic-tryptic digest and examined for epithelial infiltration and lamina propria T-cell activation. The density of intraepithelial CD3(+) and gammadelta(+) cells and of lamina propria CD25(+) mononuclear cells was higher in jejunal biopsies from type 1 diabetic patients versus control subjects. In the patients' biopsies cultured with peptic-tryptic gliadin, there was epithelial infiltration by CD3(+) cells, a significant increase in lamina propria CD25(+) and CD80(+) cells and enhanced expression of lamina propria CD54 and crypt HLA-DR. No such phenomena were observed in control subjects, even those with celiac disease-associated HLA haplotypes. In conclusion, signs of mucosal inflammation were present in jejunal biopsies from type 1 diabetic patients, and organ culture studies indicate a deranged mucosal immune response to gliadin.},

DATA SOURCES: Internet-based literature search and our own data. STUDY SELECTION: The studies included in this review were selected based on the expert opinion of the authors. RESULTS: In contrast to the beneficial expressions of gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue, which are seen with relevance to newer methods of delivery of vaccines directly applied to the gastrointestinal mucosal surfaces (eg, oral poliovirus, rotavirus, Salmonella typhi vaccines), the adverse consequences of a mucosal immune response gone astray are evidenced in many diseases such as FA. A classification of clinical disorders associated with FA based on classic mechanisms of immunologic injury is presented, which includes the following: (1) IgE-mediated, (2) non-IgE-mediated, and (3) mixed IgE- and non-IgE-mediated disorders. Our study of immunologic disturbance in patients with non-IgE FA revealed a pattern of increased CD4+ and decreased TH1 cell counts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in contrast to patients with celiac disease, where a pattern of increased CD8+ and TH1 cell counts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and increased CD8+ cell counts was seen. CONCLUSIONS: The gastrointestinal immune response thus plays a pivotal role in maintaining protective immunity in health and a critical role in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of clinical disorders associated with FA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-IgE mechanisms may also be involved food allergy (FA). Our group has been studying the immunopathogenesis clinical entities in children with gastro-intestinal symptoms and in whom biopsies of the terminal ileum show lymphoid tissue masses referred to as ileal lymphonodular hyperplasia. Our more recent studies have demonstrated Th1/Th2 cytokine profiles associated with non-IgE FA and other clinical entities. OBJECTIVE: We investigated 12 subjects with non-IgE FA (group 1) and 4 subjects with celiac disease (group 2). Cytokine profiles and immunologic studies of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and from gastro-intestinal biopsy tissues from patients in groups 1 and 2 were also evaluated. METHODS: Group 1 consisted of 12 children with clinical symptoms of anorexia, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis of non-IgE FA was established by positive double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge and reduced or negative immediate-type skin testing and negative IgE radioallergosorbent tests. Group 2 consisted of four patients with celiac disease and three adult females with biopsy-proven clinical symptoms of celiac disease. RESULTS: In group 1, peripheral blood CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte distributions were normal, with a predominance of CD4+ cells with a decreased intracellular Th1 cytokine pattern and a normal Th2 intracellular cytokine pattern. In contrast, all four patients in group 2 not only displayed abnormal CD4 and CD8 peripheral blood lymphocyte distributions (CD8 > CD4), but also an abnormal predominance of CD4+ cells with an increased Th1 and a normal Th2 cytokine pattern. A similar abnormal pattern of CD4 > CD8 ratio was observed in intestinal biopsies. All 12 patients in group 1 showed lymphonodular hyperplasia in each of the biopsies and by ileoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that abnormalities in Th1 function may not only play a role in some patients with non--IgE-mediated FA in whom decreased Th1 function is seen, but also in patients with celiac disease in whom an increased Th1 function is seen. The studies also suggest that lymphonodular hyperplasia may be a hallmark histologic lesion in patients with non--IgE-mediated FA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently there has been increasing interest in the production of gluten-free (GF) foods and studies on minor cereals and pseudocereals without celiac activity in order to fulfill the specific needs of people affected by celiac disease. GF bread, pasta, biscuits are usually manufactured using different combinations of thickenings and particular food processing procedures that could affect starch digestibility. Carbohydrates, mainly starch from cereals, play an important part in a balanced diet, and dietary guidelines suggest a diet with low glycemic index foods, that is to say rich in slowly digested carbohydrates. AIM: The present study was aimed at evaluating: 1) the importance of some GF food characteristics in relation to their effects on in vitro starch accessibility to digestion, in comparison with traditional gluten products; 2) the in vivo metabolic responses to GF foods. METHODS: Firstly, starch digestibility of several products was evaluated in vitro. Then, an in vivo study was performed on a group of healthy volunteers. Postprandial glucose and insulin responses were evaluated after administration of three GF foods and traditional bread. Triglycerides and free fatty acids (FFA) were also evaluated. Attempts were also made to explore differences in metabolic responses to GF foods in healthy subjects with respect to celiac subjects. RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) of digested starch of GF bread was slightly higher than that of the traditional counterpart. No significant difference was observed in AUCs of digested starch between GF pasta and the traditional pasta. The AUCs of digested starch of quinoa and the two samples of pasta were not statistically different. Significant differences were observed between GF bread and bread-like products. Statistic differences in glucose responses to GF pasta were observed between healthy and celiac subjects. In healthy subjects, the AUCs of glucose response after GF bread were higher than those after bread with gluten. No significant differences were observed between the AUCs of insulin responses to all products tested. Glycemic index (GI) for GF pasta was similar to GI for GF bread while GI for quinoa was slightly lower than that of GF pasta and bread. Two-way ANOVA revealed that quinoa induced lower FFA levels with respect to GF pasta. In addition, triglyceride concentrations were significantly reduced for quinoa with respect to GF bread and bread. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the different formulations and the food processing procedures used in the manufacturing of GF products may affect the rate of starch digestion both in vitro and in vivo. It may be worthwhile improving the formulation of these products. Furthermore, quinoa seems to represent a potential alternative to traditional foods, even if further and larger studies are required to demonstrate its hypoglycemic effects.},

However, it has only been in the past decade that the use of ingredients with a high resistant starch content has occurred in foods, initially in Australia but now throughout the world. Foods containing these resistant starch-rich ingredients include not only staple foods, such as bread and breakfast cereals, but also foods designed for those with special physiological or medical needs, such as celiac sensitivity and ulcerative colitis, or for individuals who are seeking to manage energy intake and control weight. Resistant starch has other benefits when compared with traditional sources of dietary fiber in that the preparation and design of foods with additional health benefits have the appearance, taste, and texture characteristics that encourage people to consume these "better for you" foods. As our knowledge of the range of physiological effects that occur through the consumption of resistant starch increases, more applications will be found for their inclusion in an expanding range of foods around the world.},

METHODS: Cross-sectional survey, with case note review of 130 adult patients with coeliac disease (90 white Caucasian and 40 South Asians). RESULTS: 87 (66.9%) of the 130 questionnaires were returned; whites: 73.3%, South Asians: 52.5% (P = 0.02). White Caucasians' assessment of their own strictness to the gluten-free diet correlated with small bowel histological recovery (OR 10.00, 95% CI 3.2-33.06) and negative endomysial antibodies (OR 34.94, CI 6.58-185.40). This was not seen in the South Asian patients. Amongst the white coeliacs, factors correlating with compliance with a gluten-free diet were: Coeliac Society membership, understanding food labelling, obtaining sufficient gluten-free products, explanation by a physician, and regular dietetic follow-up. These factors were not identified amongst the South Asians, who were less likely to attend dietetic clinics, join the Coeliac Society and be satisfied with information provided by doctors and dieticians. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the South Asians, factors were identified which related to compliance with a gluten-free diet amongst white Caucasian coeliac patients. This study has shown that the treatment approach to ethnic minorities with coeliac disease must be improved.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune pathology of the small intestine triggered, in genetically predisposed patients, by the exposition to gliadin, a flour protein, thus evoking local immune reactions and mucosal atrophy. The discovery that type 2 transglutaminase (TG2) is the main, if not the sole, target of the endomysium CD-specific autoantibodies assigned to this enzyme a master regulator role of CD. Two separated events, both based on the finding that gliadin is able to act as a TG2 substrate, have been described to indicate that TG2 is involved in both the humoral and cellular immune responses. In this paper we review the novel insights on the localization and enzymatic activity of TG2 in the small intestinal mucosa. Moreover, we report on the capability of gliadin and its peptides to act as TG2 substrates.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Celiac disease is a syndrome characterized by damage of the small intestinal mucosa caused by the gluten fraction of wheat proteins and similar alcohol-soluble proteins (prolamines) of barley and rye in genetically susceptible subjects. The presence of gluten in these subjects leads to a self- perpetuating mucosal damage, and the elimination of gluten results in full mucosal recovery. The clinical manifestations of celiac disease are protean in nature and vary markedly with the age of the patient, the duration and extent of disease, and the presence of extraintestinal pathologic changes. In addition to the classic gastrointestinal form, a variety of other clinical manifestations of the disease have been described, including atypical and asymptomatic forms. Although the typical form of celiac disease, characterized by failure to thrive, is still the most frequent presentation in the pediatric age group, severe growth delay is less commonly seen in developed countries. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent epidemiologic studies suggest that celiac disease-associated growth retardation is becoming a tangible health problem in developing countries, where the problem has been historically overlooked. Given the protean nature of the clinical presentation of celiac disease, the diagnosis is extremely challenging and relies on a sensitive and specific algorithm that allows the identification of different manifestations of the disease. Serologic tests developed in the past decade provide a noninvasive tool for screening individuals at risk for the disease as well as the general population. SUMMARY: The current gold standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease remains histologic confirmation of the intestinal damage in serologically positive individuals. The keystone treatment of celiac disease patients is a lifelong elimination diet in which food products containing gluten are avoided.},

   abstract = {Gluten or hydrolyzed gluten could be a suitable alternative to animal proteins in the wine clarification process, but their residues could represent a risk for individuals suffering from coeliac disease or allergic to cereal proteins. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of gluten in wines treated with gluten or its hydrolysate in the clarification process and to assess its antigenicity in commercial products. The presence of residual immunoreactive gluten was evaluated by electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting. Data obtained in several red and white wine samples showed that no residue was detectable in any of the red wines. In white wines, gluten reduced the protein content less completely, but most samples showed no immunoreactivity after the wine had been treated with gluten or its derivatives, either alone or combined with bentonite, silica gel or tannins. The use of gluten derivatives coupled with bentonite was the most effective method of removing immunoreactive protein in white wines. In conclusion, the use of gluten derivatives in wine clarification seems to exclude a risk for subjects susceptible to coeliac disease or gluten allergy. However, it is recommended that wine producers continuously monitor the clarification process in order to protect the most sensitive individuals.},

The condition, which is exacerbated by wheat, rye, barley and possibly oats, can be treated with a gluten-free diet in which these cereals are omitted. Serological screening, particularly of high-risk groups, with both IgA and IgG based systems can be used to identify cases. Diagnosis depends on the use of a small intestinal biopsy, which reveals the classical changes of loss of the normal villous architecture. Evidence suggests that gluten-sensitive T cells are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Use of in vitro systems has suggested an immunodominant epitope within wheat gliadin, which has been shown to exacerbate the condition in vivo. This information can be used to devise strategies to develop immuno-modulatory peptides and cereals with the baking and nutritional qualities of wheat, rye and barley, but which do not exacerbate the condition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gluten contamination in gluten-free products cannot totally be avoided. The safe threshold for gluten remains obscure. AIM: The purpose was to estimate a reasonable limit for residual gluten, based on current literature and measurement of gluten in gluten-free products on the market. METHODS: The gluten content of 59 naturally gluten-free and 24 wheat starch-based gluten-free products were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The daily intake of flours was calculated in 76 adults on gluten-free diet, and the intake compared with mucosal histology. RESULTS: A number of both naturally gluten-free (13 of 59) and wheat starch-based gluten-free (11 of 24) products contained gluten from 20 to 200 ppm (=mg/kg). The median daily flour consumption was 80 g (range: 10-300). Within these limits, the long-term mucosal recovery was good. CONCLUSIONS: The threshold for gluten-contamination can safely be set at 100 ppm. Provided that the daily flour intake is even 300 g, a level of 100 ppm results in 30 mg of gluten intake. This has been shown to be safe, when correlated to histology, in clinical and challenge studies. The level can be achieved by the industry, and does not make the diet too cumbersome.},

   abstract = {We have found that jejunal infusions of long-chain fatty acids, linoleic acid (LA) and oleic acid (OA), and gastric infusions of a fatty acid ethyl ester, ethyl oleate (EO), produce long-lasting suppression of total caloric intake. This effect is not seen in response to jejunal infusions of medium-chain fatty acids or medium- or long-chain triglycerides. Multiunit recordings have shown that intestinal infusions of LA or OA strongly activate celiac vagal afferents. Truncal vagotomy (TVX) and selective celiac-branch vagotomy (CVX) are equally effective in attenuating, but not eliminating, suppression of food intake by LA and EO. These outcomes suggest that intraintestinal fatty acids reduce intake by activation of vagal mechanisms, critically involving afferent fibers within the celiac branches, as well as unidentified nonvagal mechanisms. The role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in mediating the activation of celiac vagal afferents is suggested by studies showing that (1) inhibition of food intake by CCK-8 administration is attenuated after CVX but robust after celiac-spared vagotomy (CSV), (2) multiunit activity of celiac vagal afferents is increased by CCK-8 administration, and (3) activation of celiac fibers by intestinal LA infusion is severely attenuated by the CCK(A) antagonist lorglumide.},

   abstract = {The management of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frequent, yet challenging task in both primary care and gastroenterology practice. A diagnostic strategy guided by keen clinical judgment should focus on positive symptom criteria and on the absence of alarm symptoms. In younger patients lacking alarm features, invasive testing has a low-yield. The presence of food intolerance and underlying celiac disease should be excluded. The usefulness of fecal tests such as calprotectin and lactoferrin to exclude organic bowel disease is not adequately established. In patients with moderate to severe symptoms who fail initial therapeutic trials, further tests can be performed in tertiary care settings, such as transit measurement and tests for diagnosing pelvic floor dysfunction. Treatment strategies for IBS are currently directed at the predominant symptoms. In diarrhea-predominant IBS, opioids (e.g. loperamide) and the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist alosetron are efficacious. In constipation-predominant IBS, fiber and bulk laxatives are traditionally used, but their efficacy is variable and may worsen symptoms. The 5-HT(4) receptor agonist tegaserod is efficacious in female patients with IBS and constipation. In patients with IBS and abdominal pain, antispasmodics and antidepressants can be used, with the best evidence supporting the prescription of tricyclic antidepressants. The efficacy of psychological treatments in terms of relieving the symptoms of IBS is still uncertain. Limited evidence suggests that anti-enkephalinase agents, somatostatin analogues, alpha(2)-receptor agonists, opioid antagonists, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, probiotics and herbal treatments may be useful in IBS patients.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gut functional diseases, affecting 10-20% of people worldwide. Although most patients do not seek medical help, the disease accounts for huge costs for both patients and health-care systems and worsens significantly patients' quality of life. Diagnosis is based on the identification of symptoms according to Manning, Rome I and Rome II criteria and exclusion of alarm indicators. IBS symptoms overlap with those of coeliac disease, lactose intolerance, food allergies and bile salt malabsorption. The treatment of IBS is centred on an excellent doctor-patient relationship along with drugs targeting the predominant symptom, especially during exacerbations. Current pharmacological remedies are unsatisfactory due to the high number of patients complaining of lack of response and/or symptom recurrence. Although useful in some IBS patients, the validity of psychotherapy deserves further investigation. A wide array of potentially useful drugs are currently under consideration in pre-clinical trials. A better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying IBS may help to develop more effective drugs for this disease.},

   abstract = {This work was aimed at producing a sourdough bread that is tolerated by celiac sprue (CS) patients. Selected sourdough lactobacilli had specialized peptidases capable of hydrolyzing Pro-rich peptides, including the 33-mer peptide, the most potent inducer of gut-derived human T-cell lines in CS patients. This epitope, the most important in CS, was hydrolyzed completely after treatment with cells and their cytoplasmic extracts (CE). A sourdough made from a mixture of wheat (30%) and nontoxic oat, millet, and buckwheat flours was started with lactobacilli. After 24 h of fermentation, wheat gliadins and low-molecular-mass, alcohol-soluble polypeptides were hydrolyzed almost totally. Proteins were extracted from sourdough and used to produce a peptic-tryptic digest for in vitro agglutination tests on K 562(S) subclone cells of human origin. The minimal agglutinating activity was ca. 250 times higher than that of doughs chemically acidified or started with baker's yeast. Two types of bread, containing ca. 2 g of gluten, were produced with baker's yeast or lactobacilli and CE and used for an in vivo double-blind acute challenge of CS patients. Thirteen of the 17 patients showed a marked alteration of intestinal permeability after ingestion of baker's yeast bread. When fed the sourdough bread, the same 13 patients had values for excreted rhamnose and lactulose that did not differ significantly from the baseline values. The other 4 of the 17 CS patients did not respond to gluten after ingesting the baker's yeast or sourdough bread. These results showed that a bread biotechnology that uses selected lactobacilli, nontoxic flours, and a long fermentation time is a novel tool for decreasing the level of gluten intolerance in humans.},

   abstract = {Interest in celiac disease, a common enteropathy in Europe and the USA (1/200) caused by the dietary ingestion of gluten in susceptible subjects, has increased over the last few years. Its pathogenesis is still not completely clear, but it certainly involves immune-mediated mechanisms. Although a number of studies have been published concerning the role of T cells in inducing intestinal damage, little is known about the early stages in which gliadin (the toxic component of gluten) starts the whole process. In vitro two- and three-dimensional (multicellular spheroid) cell cultures are a simple and useful means of studying the direct cellular effects of gliadin and other "toxic" cereal peptides. Furthermore, in addition to improving our understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms, cell cultures can also be used to test modified peptides that could replace the toxic components present in the foods that celiac patients must avoid.},

   abstract = {A retrospective review of patients treated with a history of chronic visceral ischemia (CVI) was made to determine primary patency of open surgical repair and estimated symptom-free survival. Patients with CVI between 1990 and 2003 were reviewed. Included were those with chronic symptoms alone (C-CVI) and acute-on-chronic symptoms (A-CVI). Data were obtained from a vascular database. Symptom-free survival and graft patency were estimated by using product limit estimates. Fifty-eight patients (13 men, 45 women; mean age: 63 years) were treated surgically for C-CVI (34 patients) and A-CVI (24 patients). All patients had postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss (mean: 17 kg). One fourth reported food fear. Preoperative imaging demonstrated disease of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) (100%; 64% occluded), celiac axis (89%; 37% occluded), and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) (54%; 60% occluded). Multiple vessels were involved in 95% of patients (mean: 2.3 vessels/patient). Operative management included antegrade revascularization of 80 vessels. Combined aortic and/or renal procedures were performed in 7 patients. Patient demographics and visceral disease did not differ for C-CVI and A-CVI; however, perioperative mortality differed significantly (10% for C-CVI vs 54% for A-CVI [p < 0.001]). Intestinal gangrene at presentation was associated with perioperative (hazard ratio [HR]: 7.6; 95% CI: 2.7-21.6; p=0.0002) and follow-up death (HR: 7.8; CI 2.8-21.9; p <0.0001). Follow-up (mean: 34 months) was complete for 54/68 vessels (79%). Estimated primary and primary assisted patency at 5 years were 81% and 89% respectively. Estimated symptom-free survival for hospital survivors was 57% at 70 months. Open antegrade methods of visceral artery repair for CVI were durable and associated with 57% symptom-free survival at 70 months. Patient demographics and distribution of visceral artery anatomy were similar; however, perioperative mortality for C-CVI and A-CVI differed dramatically. Improved outcomes for A-CVI require recognition and treatment of CVI before onset of intestinal gangrene.},

   abstract = {The intestine constitutes the largest interface between a person and his or her environment, and an intact intestinal barrier is thus essential in maintaining health and preventing tissue injury and several diseases. The intestinal barrier has various immunological and non-immunological components. The epithelial barrier is one of the most important non-immunological components. Hyperpermeability of this barrier is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of several gastrointestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease and food allergy. Hence, assessing barrier integrity is of the utmost importance. One of the more quantitative gauges for this assessment is transepithelial permeability of various molecular probes, among which sugars are commonly used. Measures of intestinal permeability might also be useful as markers for assessment of prognosis and follow up in various gastrointestinal disorders. The present article is a review of the normal and abnormal functioning of the intestinal barrier, the diseases that can result from loss of barrier integrity, and some promising agents and strategies for restoring barrier normality and integrity.},

In this study, we report recognition of the gliadin-derived peptide (A-gliadin 123-132) by CD8(+) T lymphocytes from celiac patients. A-gliadin 123-132-specific IFN-gamma production and cytotoxic activity were detected in PBMCs derived from patients on gluten-free diet, but not from either celiac patients on gluten-containing diet or healthy controls. In contrast, A-gliadin 123-132-specific cells were isolated from small intestine biopsies of patients on either gluten-free or gluten-containing diets. Short-term T cell lines derived from the small intestinal mucosa and specific for the 123-132 epitope recognized human APC pulsed with either whole recombinant alpha-gliadin or a partial pepsin-trypsin gliadin digest. Finally, we speculate on a possible mechanism leading to processing and presentation of class I-restricted gliadin-derived epitopes in celiac disease patients.},

   abstract = {The present study tested the hypothesis that, in normal male rats, chronic changes in salt intake alter the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and the norepinephrine transporter in sympathetic ganglia. Increasing dietary salt (from 0.02% to 1%, 4% or 8% NaCl in rat chow) decreased (p<0.05) the mRNA levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and the norepinephrine transporter in the adrenal gland, superior cervical ganglia and celiac ganglia. In addition, tyrosine hydroxylase and norepinephrine transporter protein levels were decreased (p<0.05) in the adrenal gland. To test the hypothesis that NaCl acts directly on postganglionic neurons to suppress the expression of these proteins, it was determined if increases in NaCl concentrations, of a magnitude achieved during increases in dietary salt in vivo, suppress expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and the norepinephrine transporter in cultured sympathetic neurons in vitro. Increased dietary salt increased plasma NaCl concentrations each by up to 4-6 mEq l(-1) (p<0.05), with the greatest increases occurring at night when the rats consume most of their food. In addition, NaCl added to cultured neurons decreased tyrosine hydroxylase and norepinephrine transporter protein and mRNA levels, and norepinephrine uptake; however, the NaCl concentration increases required were 15-30 mEq l(-1). These data suggest that increased dietary salt can influence the activity of the sympathetic nervous system by suppressing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and the norepinephrine transporter. While increased NaCl levels can act directly on neurons to suppress these proteins, this action may occur in vivo only in severe pathophysiological states, but not during increases in dietary salt without the synergistic effect of other factors.},

   abstract = {Women with long-standing coeliac disease express poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than men do for unclear reasons. This led us to explore differences in their understanding of HRQoL using a phenomenographic approach. We interviewed 10 coeliac subjects (mean age 57 years, range 35-73) who had been on a gluten-free diet for 10 years and had scored either high or low in the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) General Health and Vitality scales. Three dimensions were revealed that pertained to their perception of HRQoL: bodily sensations, social consequences and coping strategies. Within these, the women experienced more bowel symptoms than men did, despite keeping to a strict diet. This item was the only one predicting the SF-36 scores. The women also described more distress caused by the restrictions in daily life, closely related to their controlling of food contents. The coeliac men took advantage of using a problem-oriented coping approach while the women seeking an emotionally oriented strategy showed less satisfaction with the outcome. We conclude that the intriguing difference in HRQoL between coeliac men and women may have some of its origin in the way living with the disorder is conceptualized and coped with. The results imply that in the management of coeliac patients, gender-related aspects need to be taken into account to improve treatment outcome.},

Most prenatal vitamins contain 0.8 to 0.9 mg of folic acid, double the amount recommended by Health Canada for prevention of neural tube defects. Without supplementation (eg, undiagnosed pregnancy), women with celiac disease might not take in enough folate to maintain protective levels.},

While building up its immune system, the infant is supported by the transplacental IgG antibodies, which also contain anti-idiotypic antibodies, possibly also actively priming the offspring. The second mode of transfer of immunity occurs via the milk. Numerous major protective components, including secretory IgA (SIgA) antibodies and lactoferrin, are present. The breastfed infant is better protected against numerous common infections than the non-breastfed. Breastfeeding also seems to actively stimulate the infant's immune system by anti-idiotypes, uptake of milk lymphocytes, cytokines, etc. Therefore, the breastfed child continues to be better protected against various infections for some years. Vaccine responses are also often enhanced in breastfed infants. Long-lasting protection against certain immunological diseases such as allergies and celiac disease is also noted.},

   abstract = {Patients with coeliac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) are intolerant against gliadins from wheat and the respective proteins from related cereals and have to keep a lifelong gluten-free diet. For control of gliadin in gluten-free food sensitive assay techniques are necessary. We developed an immunopolymerase chain reaction (iPCR) assay for gliadin. In this technique immunological detection of gliadin by a monoclonal antibody R5 conjugated with an oligonucleotide is amplified by PCR. For quantification, iPCR was performed as real-time PCR (real-time iPCR) in one step. By means of real-time iPCR, the sensitivity of gliadin analysis was increased more than 30-fold above the level reached by enzyme immunoassay. Real time-iPCR using R5 directly conjugated with oligonucleotide was clearly more sensitive than real time-iPCR applying sequentially biotinylated R5, streptavidin, and biotinylated oligonucleotide. With directly conjugated R5 gliadin was detected at a concentration as low as 0.16 ng/mL corresponding to 16 microg gliadin/100 g food or 0.16 ppm (corresponding to 0.25 g of food extracted in 10 mL of solvent and 25-fold dilution of the extract prior to analysis). This is the first report applying the highly sensitive technique of iPCR for gliadin analysis. Furthermore, this is the first approach to perform real-time iPCR in one step without changing the reaction vessels after enzyme immunoassay for subsequent PCR analysis thus minimizing risks of contamination and loss of sensitivity.},

   abstract = {Functional dyspepsia can be associated with impaired gastric relaxation in response to food intake and delayed gastric emptying. In this study, we investigated whether luminal hydrochloric acid (HCl) may reproduce these motor alterations in phenobarbital-anaesthetized rats via activation of extrinsic neural pathways. Intragastric pressure (IGP) changes induced by a 2-mL fluid bolus were recorded with an oesophageal catheter, and gastric emptying was determined via the fluid volume recovered from the stomach 30-min post-bolus. Experiments involving acute nerve transections or pharmacological blockade of nitric oxide synthesis revealed that the initial increase of IGP after a 0.35 mol L(-1) HCl bolus is dampened by duodenogastric and gastrogastric relaxation reflexes depending on vagal and splanchnic pathways as well as nitric oxide. Compared with saline, HCl (0.15-0.5 mol L(-1)) delayed the subsequent decrease (adaptation) of IGP, inhibited gastric emptying and stimulated gastric fluid secretion as seen in stomachs with ligated pylorus. The acid-evoked delay in IGP adaptation and inhibition of gastric emptying involved duodenogastric and duodenopyloric extrinsic nerve reflexes, whereas the gastric fluid secretion was independent of the extrinsic innervation. It is proposed that the gastropyloric motor changes induced by luminal acid challenge have a bearing on the motor disturbances underlying functional dyspepsia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is a genetically linked immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing grains food. Deficiencies of trace elements and vitamins may be found in patients with untreated CD. No systematic studies have been carried out on vitamin E status in coeliacs. Tocopherol deficiency is implicated in the biological processes leading to malignant cell transformations, neurological complications, brown bowel syndrome and reproductive disorders. Untreated patients with CD have higher incidences of these disorders than in general population. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate vitamin E status in patients with coeliac disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined retinol plasma level and tocopherol levels both in plasma and in erythrocytes in 18 patients (age: 2-53 years) with active CD and 12 coeliacs (age: 3-36 years) on gluten-free diet without antiendomysium antibodies for at least 2 years. Vitamins were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography according to the procedure of Driskell. RESULTS: In untreated patients levels of plasma tocopherol (13.7 +/-3.8 micromol/L vs. 20 +/-7.1 micromol/L; p<0.02), erythrocytes tocopherol (1.7 +/-0.45 micromol/L vs.2.89 +/-0.52 micromol/L; p<0.001) and ratio of plasma tocopherol to serum total cholesterol (3.36 +/-0.9 micromol/L vs. 4.24 +/-0.85 micromol/L; p<0.02) were significantly lower compared to those on gluten-free diet. In the all patients with active CD, concentrations of tocopherol in erythrocytes were below the norm (N>2.5 micromol/L). In untreated patients vitamin A levels did not achieve a significant difference in comparison with the coeliacs on gluten-free diet (1.75 +/-0.57 micromol/L vs. 1.97 +/-0.72 micromol/L; p>0.05). The lowest levels of tocopherol (in plasma: 5.7 micromol/L, in erythrocytes: 0.74 micromol/L) and retinol (0.8 micromol/L; N>0.7 micromol/L) were detected in the same patient refusing dietetic treatment for more than 10 years. CONCLUSION: The conventional treatment of CD is gluten-free diet, but monitoring of tocopherol concentrations, especially in erythrocytes, and correction of its deficiency may offer some benefit for patients who fail to adhere strictly to a gluten free-diet or newly diagnosed coeliacs.},

   abstract = {Wheat gliadin is the triggering agent in coeliac disease. In this study, we documented that proteolytic fragments of gliadin, in contrast to other food antigens, induced interleukin (IL)-8 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production and significantly increased interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced cytokine secretion in human monocytic line THP-1 cells. Stimulation with gliadin resulted in elevated phosphorylation of the IkappaBalpha molecule and increased NF-kappaB/DNA binding activity that was inhibited by sulfasalazine, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). The activation pathway was shown to be independent of the CD14 molecule. Less mature U-937 monocytes responded to gliadin stimulation by low IL-8 secretion, TNF-alpha production was not detectable. We propose that gliadin-induced activation of monocytes/macrophages can participate in mechanisms leading to the impairment of intestinal mucosa in coeliac patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of iron supplementation, in addition to gluten free diet (GFD), on hematological profile of children with Celiac Disease (CD). METHODS: Children diagnosed as CD as per modified ESPGAN criteria were prospectively evaluated for their hematological profile at the time of their enrolment and after consuming GFD for at least one year. The results were compared with age and sex matched controls. Evaluation of hematological profile included hemoglobin estimation, complete blood counts, peripheral blood smear examination, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and serum ferritin estimation. All the enrolled cases were given iron supplementation in addition to exclusion of gluten from their diet. Repeat intestinal biopsy was performed in all the cases after completing 1 year on GFD. RESULTS: Twenty one children (mean age 6.67 years, range 4-11 years) diagnosed as CD who completed at least one year of regular follow up on GFD (mean 1.5 years, range 1-2 years) were analysed for their hematological profile at the time of enrolment and after consuming GFD and iron supplementation. At the time of enrolment all the children had hemoglobin level <11 gm%, 78% had microcytic hypochromic anemia and 22% had dimorphic anemia, with lower mean MCV, MCH and serum ferritin levels, and a significantly higher mean TIBC as compared to controls (p<0.001). In the follow up evaluation of these cases on GFD, mean hemoglobin levels were comparable with controls but the cases continued to have lower mean MCV, MCH serum ferritin levels (p<0.05) and higher mean TIBC (p<0.05). Seven children had mild anemia. Serum ferritin levels showed a negative correlation with the grade of villous atrophy and lamina propria infiltrate. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is commonly associated with CD and iron deficiency state continues for a longer time even after excluding gluten from the diet and iron supplementation. Apart from offering them GFD rich in iron, early detection and treatment of IDA and prophylactic iron folic acid supplementation will go a long way to optimize their mental and psychomotor functions.},

Doppler ultrasound (US) waveform analysis of the celiac artery (CA) and the cranial mesenteric artery (CMA) of eight healthy dogs was performed both in the fasting state and at 20, 40, 60 and 90 min after feeding maintenance, high protein, high carbohydrate and high fat diets. Resistive index (RI), pulsatility index (PI) and the percentage differences between measurements were calculated. In fasted dogs, the CA showed significantly (p<0.05) lower resistance than the CMA. With all diets, post-prandial RI and PI values decreased significantly in both vessels (CA: RI=-12-13%; PI=-25-29%; CMA: RI=-13-15%; PI=-27-29% [p<0.05]), and in all cases significantly earlier in the CA than in the CMA (p<0.05). With all diets except high fat the maximum decrease in RI and PI was reached in the CA at 40 min and in the CMA at 60 min. High fat diets were unique in that the maximum decrease in RI and PI in the CMA occurred earlier (at 20 min) and values were slower to return to normal (p<0.05). We conclude that Doppler US can be used in dogs to quantify significant differences in the response of splanchnic blood flow to different dietary components.},

Doppler waveform analysis of the celiac artery (CA) and the cranial mesenteric artery (CMA) of 8 dogs with proven food hypersensitivity was performed in the fasting state and at 20, 40, 60, and 90 minutes after feeding their regular daily diet, and at 2 and 4 days after feeding 4 different allergens. Resistive index (RI), pulsatility index (PI), and the percentage differences between these measurements were calculated and compared statistically. The maximal decrease in RI and PI after feeding the regular diet was reached at 40 minutes after ingestion in both vessels (CA: RI = -6%, PI = -23%; CMA: RI = -9%, PI = -30%). After this trough, the resistance in both vessels rose nearly to baseline after 90 minutes (CA: RI = -1%, PI = -13%; CMA: RI = -3%, PI = -14%). When fed an allergen-containing meal the percentage changes at the trough were significantly greater (CA: RI = -10%, PI = -32%; CMA: RI = - 14%, PI = -40 %; p < 0.05) compared to those seen after feeding the maintenance diet. Also, RI and PI values were significantly (P < .05) lower at 90 minutes on days 2 and 4 of the challenge period. During the challenge period, dogs did not show overt signs of gastrointestinal disease. Significant postprandial hemodynamic alterations in response to food allergens in dogs with food hypersensitivities can be shown noninvasively with Doppler ultrasound.},

METHODS: A questionnaire filled in retrospectively by their parents was used to describe the frequency of various abdominal symptoms during the previous 2 y and to select the symptomatic subjects for closer clinical examination. In the clinical investigation of the children, an elimination challenge with milk protein and lactose intolerance tests, as well as endoscopic examinations in selected cases and blood tests, were performed. RESULTS: In all, 110 (27%) subjects reported some gastrointestinal (GI) complaints during the last 2 y; 64 (16%) meeting the Apley criteria for recurrent abdominal pain. A specific organic or functional disorder was found in 26 subjects (6%), two having no GI symptoms. Milk protein intolerance was the most common specific disorder diagnosed in nine subjects (2.2%), followed by lactose intolerance in eight (2%), coeliac disease in five (1.2%) and Helicobacter pylori infection in three (0.7%). An endoscopic examination performed on 17 subjects (4.2%) and a colonoscopy on three revealed significant findings in 11; lymphonodular changes being most common, occurring in five subjects. Subjects with milk protein-induced disorders showed significantly lower IgA-class antibodies to milk and its fractions than the non-symptomatic controls. Chronic diseases, short breastfeeding, GI problems and food intolerance during the first year of life were observed as significant risk factors in determining whether a subject belonged to the group experiencing any GI complaints. CONCLUSION: We conclude that in one in five of those with any, even mild, GI complaints we were able to assess a specific organic disease; milk-induced disorders being most common. A milk protein and/or lactose load test, completed in some cases with an endoscopic examination, would help in assessing a proper individual diagnosis.},

   abstract = {AIM: Recently, we reported typical endoscopic findings and an increment in gammadelta+ T cells in the foregut among children with food-sensitive enteropathy other than coeliac disease. To find out the extend to which the upregulation of the local immune response might explain gastrointestinal (GI) complaints of the foregut, we sought to examine by the increment in gammadelta+ T cells a I-y consecutive series of children referred for recurrent GI complaints to a tertiary-level hospital. METHODS: A 1-y cohort of 102 children scheduled for gastroduodenoscopy were examined for mucosal histology and the densities of CD3+, alphabeta+ and alphabeta+ T-cell subsets from mid-duodenal specimens. The final diagnostic categories were used in analysing the data. RESULTS: Fifteen subjects showed villous atrophy and a high gammadelta+ T-cell density; the finding being compatible with coeliac disease (CD). At the other extreme, 20 subjects in whom diagnostic GI diseases were ruled out showed low densities and served as controls. The subjects reporting GI symptoms after an open food challenge with milk and/or cereals (n = 18) as well as children remitting with a milk- or cereal-eliminating diet but not responding to a challenge (n = 23) also expressed significantly higher densities of gammadelta+ T cells than the controls. In all, 45 of 102 children could be considered to have an elevated gamma6+ T-cell density as an indication of locally activated immune response. Lack of villous architecture and lymphonodular hyperplasia of the duodenal bulb as an endoscopic finding and atopic dermatitis but not the presence of DQ2 alleles showed a close association with these increased densities. CONCLUSION: Considering that an elevated incidence of gammadelta+ T cells is an indication of mucosal response against luminal antigens, up to half the children with prolonged GI symptoms have immune mediated disorder; CD and food allergy being the most obvious clinical entities.},

Most responses used three- or five-point Likert scales. They were mailed to members of the Westchester Celiac Sprue Support Group. Of the 274 responses, 253 were usable and were the basis of the compiled results. Seventy-four percent of the respondents were female; 42% were between the ages of 36 and 55 years of age, and 46% were more than 55 years of age. Frequencies and cross-tabulations indicated several areas of negative impact in maintaining a gluten-free diet. They included the difficulties of dining out (86%), travel (82%), and impact on family (67%) and less of a negative impact on career or work (41%). The gluten-free diet impacted various lifestyle aspects of the quality of life for individuals with celiac disease.},

Ten-day ad libitum food intake and body weight regain after previous body weight loss (13% of initial body weight) due to restrictive feeding were measured in rats with sham deafferentation (SHAM; n = 6), subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (SDA; n = 7), and SDA plus celiac-superior mesenteric ganglionectomy (SDA/CGX; n = 9). HCA suppressed the 10-day cumulative food intake in all surgical groups and body weight regain in SDA and SDA/CGX groups. Independent of HCA, SDA and SDA/CGX rats consumed less food and gained less weight compared to SHAM rats. These results demonstrate that all vagal afferents from below the diaphragm and vagal efferents of the dorsal trunk as well as splanchnic nerves (afferents and efferents) are not necessary for the feeding-suppressive effect of HCA in this animal model. Vagal afferents, however, appear to play a role in the control of intake when a high-glucose diet is consumed after a period of restrictive feeding.},

   abstract = {Enterostatin, a pentapeptide released from the exocrine pancreas and gastrointestinal tract, selectively inhibits fat intake through activation of an afferent vagal signaling pathway. This study investigated if the effects of enterostatin were mediated through a CCK-dependent pathway. The series of in vivo and in vitro experiments included studies of 1) the feeding effect of peripheral enterostatin on Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats lacking CCK-A receptors, 2) the effect of CCK-8S on the intake of a two-choice high-fat (HF)/low-fat (LF) diet, 3) the effects of peripheral or central injection of the CCK-A receptor antagonist lorglumide on the feeding inhibition induced by either central or peripheral enterostatin, and 4) the ability of enterostatin to displace CCK binding in a 3T3 cell line expressing CCK-A receptor gene and in rat brain sections. The results showed that OLTEF rats did not respond to enterostatin (300 microg/kg ip) in contrast to the 23% reduction in intake of HF diet in Long Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) control rats. CCK (1 microg/kg ip) decreased the intake of the HF diet in a two-choice diet regime with a compensatory increase in intake of the LF diet. Peripheral injection of lorglumide (300 microg/kg) blocked the feeding inhibition induced by either near-celiac arterial or intracerebroventricular enterostatin, whereas intracerebroventricular lorglumide (5 nmol icv) only blocked the response to intracerebroventricular enterostatin but not to arterial enterostatin. Enterostatin did not bind on CCK-A receptors because neither enterostatin nor its analogs VPDPR and beta-casomorphin displaced [3H]L-364,718 from CCK-A receptors expressed in 3T3 cells or the binding of 125I-CCK-8S from rat brain sections. The data suggest that both the peripheral and central responses to enterostatin are mediated through or dependent on peripheral and central CCK-A receptors.},

   abstract = {Life-long gluten-free diet is the established therapy for coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis. Diet therapy allows the intestinal mucosa to recover, improves nutrient malabsorption, osteoporosis and a weakened general condition. A gluten-free diet is without wheat, rye and barley and related products. Oats tested free of contamination by other cereals has recently been allowed for adult coeliac patients, but concern still remains regarding its general safety. Gluten-free flour mixes contain more starch and less proteins, vitamins, minerals and fibre compared to regular flour. Recently some questions have been raised as to the nutritional quality of the gluten-free diet. Successful therapy with gluten-free diet requires motivation and dietary counselling, including knowledge of the nutritional value of foods, labelling of prepackaged foods and practical training in cooking. The local chapters of the Norwegian Coeliac Society are active partners, as are the clinical nutritionists that work in most major hospitals. The physician making the diagnosis has a duty to see to it that all coeliac patients get adequate dietary counselling and management.},

   abstract = {Celiac Sprue is a widely prevalent immune disease of the small intestine induced by dietary gluten intake in genetically susceptible individuals. It has been suggested that prolyl endopeptidases (PEPs) may be useful catalysts for gluten detoxification. We have investigated this hypothesis using food-grade gluten as the target antigen, and a combination of mass spectrometry and patient-derived T cells as quantitative assay systems. Spectrometric characterization of physiologically proteolyzed gluten revealed a number of 10 to 50 residue peptides containing known T cell epitopes involved in Celiac Sprue pathogenesis. Several of these peptides were multivalent, suggesting they may be potent triggers of the inflammatory response to gluten in celiac patients. Treatment of proteolyzed gluten with recombinant bacterial PEP decreased the number of potentially immunostimulatory peptides. Substantially reduced immunogenicity was also quantified in 12 of 14 intestinal polyclonal T cell lines from celiac patients. Kinetic investigations using eight T cell clones showed rapid destruction of alpha-gliadin epitopes, but less complete processing of gamma-gliadin epitopes. Given the difficulty associated with a strict lifelong gluten-exclusion diet, the ability of a single enzyme to greatly reduce the antigenic burden of grocery store gluten reinforces the case for developing oral peptidase therapy against Celiac Sprue.},

One is HLA-DQ8 restricted, its recognition by T cells being increased by introduction of negatively charged residues operated by tissue transglutaminase. AIM: To test HLA-DQ8 restricted epitope in both native (QYPSGQGSFQPSQQNPQA) and deamidated (QYPSGEGSFQPSQENPQA) forms in an organ culture system of treated coeliac mucosa from HLA-DQ8 positive and HLA-DQ8 negative patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Jejunal biopsies obtained from 10 patients with coeliac disease (six HLA-DQ8 positive and four HLA-DQ8 negative) were cultured in vitro with a peptic-tryptic digest (PT) of gliadin, or with the native (peptide A) or deamidated (peptide B) peptide. Intraepithelial CD3(+) and lamina propria total CD25(+) and CD3(+)CD25(+) cells were counted, lamina propria intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression was evaluated, as well as that of Fas molecules on epithelial cells. RESULTS: In HLA-DQ8 positive, but not in HLA-DQ8 negative, coeliacs the density of intraepithelial CD3(+) cells, lamina propria total CD25(+), and CD3(+)CD25(+) cells, as well as expression of ICAM-1 and Fas molecules were significantly increased in biopsies cultured with PT, peptide A, or peptide B compared with biopsies cultured in medium alone. CONCLUSION: These data show that the DQ8 restricted gliadin peptide is immunogenic only in the intestinal mucosa of HLA-DQ8 positive coeliac patients in both native and deamidated forms.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a permanent immune-mediated food intolerance triggered by ingestion of wheat gliadins in genetically susceptible individuals. It has been reported that tissue transglutaminase plays an important role in the onset of celiac disease by converting specific glutamine residues within gliadin fragments into glutamic acid residues. This process increases binding affinity of gliadin peptides to HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules, thus enhancing the immune response. The aim of the present study was to achieve a detailed structural characterization of modifications induced by transglutaminase on gliadin peptides. Therefore, structural analyses were carried out on a recombinant alpha-gliadin and on a panel of 26 synthetic peptides, overlapping the complete protein sequence. Modified glutamine residues were identified by means of advanced mass-spectrometric methodologies on the basis of MALDI-TOF-MS and tandem mass spectrometry. Results led to the identification of 19 of 94 glutamine residues present in the recombinant alpha-gliadin, which were converted into glutamic acid residues by a transglutaminase-mediated reaction. This allowed us to achieve a global view of the modifications induced by the enzyme on this protein. Furthermore, results gathered could likely be utilized as relevant information for a better understanding of processes leading to T-cell recognition of gliadin peptides involved in celiac disease.},

Thus, CD patients are likely to benefit from a computer-based interactive training program (CBITP) combined with interactive exercises. We compared a CBITP and a conventional training for CD patients regarding increased knowledge, transferability and sustainability. In that context we analyzed whether CD patients are more able to judge the risk of a food or a situation after practicing with the interactive training software. Sixty-four CD patients were included and randomized in two groups. While the first group used the CBITP, the control group received written instructions. Before and after taking part in the training program and 3 weeks later, the participants filled in a questionnaire for celiac knowledge. The results show that both intervention and control groups increased knowledge about CD. However, the intervention group showed significantly better outcome. A CBITP significantly increases knowledge and sustainability as compared to a conventional training for CD patients. CBITPs can enhance patients' training and treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The chronic, small intestinal inflammation that defines celiac disease is initiated by a HLA-DQ2 restricted T-cell response to ingested gluten peptides after their in vivo deamidation by tissue transglutaminase (TG2). To date, celiac disease can only be treated by a lifelong abstinence from foods that contain wheat, rye, or barley; better therapeutic options are hence needed. An attractive target would be to identify nontoxic wheat cultivars or components thereof with intact baking qualities. Because these qualities are mainly determined by the high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin proteins of gluten, it is critical to know if these proteins are toxic or, more specifically, if they will trigger the activation of T cells in the celiac lesion. METHODS: Different, highly purified HMW glutenins were isolated from wheat cultivars or expressed as recombinant proteins. The proteins were first tested for recognition by a large panel of gluten-specific T-cell lines established from celiac lesions and then applied during ex vivo challenges of celiac biopsies to allow for a direct identification of HMW specific T cells. RESULTS: Intestinal T-cell responses to TG2-deamidated HMW glutenins but not the corresponding native proteins were detectable in 9 of the 22 adult and childhood celiac disease patients tested. CONCLUSIONS: T cells within celiac lesions frequently recognize deamidated HMW glutenin proteins. This finding questions the possibility of implementing these proteins in novel food items destined to be nontoxic for celiac disease patients.},

Gluten-free foods intended for dietary use can now be analysed reliably for residual gluten by the new R5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system. Some major problems of gluten analysis (sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility) can be solved by the new method. Therefore, the information given by the new test system is relevant and superior to earlier methods. Further clinical studies using small dose challenges and dietary records including gluten analysis are necessary until a more meaningful discussion on standards for gluten-free foods can be started.},

   abstract = {The intestinal immune system discriminates between invasive pathogens and antigens that are harmless, such as food proteins and commensal bacteria. The latter groups of antigens normally induce tolerance and a breakdown in this homeostatic process can lead to diseases such as coeliac disease or Crohn's disease. The nature ofthe intestinal immune response depends on how antigen is presented to CD4+ T cells by dendritic cells (DCs). Both oral tolerance and priming are influenced by the numbers and activation status of DCs in the gut and its draining lymphoid tissues, and our current work indicates that dietary proteins are taken up preferentially by DCs in the lamina propria of the small intestine. These then migrate to interact with antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in the mesenteric lymph node. In vivo and in vitro studies using purified lamina propria DCs suggest these may play a unique role in the regulation of intestinal immune responses. We propose that local DCs are the gatekeepers of the mucosal immune system, inducing tolerance under physiological conditions, but being sufficiently responsive to inflammatory stimuli to allow T cell priming and protective immunity when necessary. In addition, we will discuss evidence that adjuvant vectors such as ISCOMS may be effective mucosal vaccines due to an ability to activate intestinal DCs.},

   abstract = {Oral tolerance was first detailed almost 100 years ago, and since then, it has been shown repeatedly that feeding a wide variety of nonpathogenic antigens can inhibit subsequent systemic immune responses. All systemic immune responses are susceptible, but the degree and scope of the suppression depends on the nature and dose of the fed antigen. Oral tolerance has been described in most mammals, including humans, and it may be the homeostatic mechanism that prevents hypersensitivity to food antigens, as is found in celiac disease. A similar process may prevent the aberrant immune responses to commensal bacteria that occur in inflammatory bowel disease. The ability of oral tolerance to modulate experimental models of autoimmune and inflammatory disease has led to clinical trials in such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and type I diabetes, with only variable success. Despite intense research, the exact mechanisms responsible for the systemic tolerance and the reasons why tolerance is the default response to many fed antigens remain controversial. Early studies suggested that CD8(+) "suppressor" T cells were important, but it is now accepted that it may involve either anergy/deletion of CD4(+) T cells, or the induction of regulatory CD4(+) T cells that produce IL-10 and/or TGFbeta. There may also be a role for CD4(+) CD25(+) T(reg), but how and when all these different mechanisms operate is still unclear. The ability of fed antigens to induce tolerance probably reflects their uptake by "quiescent" antigen-presenting cells in the intestine, with presentation to specific CD4(+) T cells in the absence of costimulation, or with the involvement of inhibitory costimulatory molecules. Dendritic cells in the Peyer's patches or mucosal lamina propria are the most likely APCs involved, but it remains to be determined exactly where these interactions occur and what the precise nature of the relevant dendritic cells is.},

   abstract = {Recurrent aphthous ulcers represent a very common but poorly understood mucosal disorder. They occur in men and women of all ages, races and geographic regions. It is estimated that at least 1 in 5 individuals has at least once been afflicted with aphthous ulcers. The condition is classified as minor, major, and herpetiform on the basis of ulcer size and number. Attacks may be precipitated by local trauma, stress, food intake, drugs, hormonal changes and vitamin and trace element deficiencies. Local and systemic conditions, and genetic, immunological and microbial factors all may play a role in the pathogenesis of recurrent aphthous ulceration (RAU). However, to date, no principal cause has been discovered. Since the aetiology is unknown, diagnosis is entirely based on history and clinical criteria and no laboratory procedures exist to confirm the diagnosis. Although RAU may be a marker of an underlying systemic illness such as coeliac disease, or may present as one of the features of Behcet's disease, in most cases no additional body systems are affected, and patients remain otherwise fit and well. Different aetiologies and mechanisms might be operative in the aetiopathogenesis of aphthous ulceration, but pain, recurrence, self-limitation of the condition, and destruction of the epithelium seem to be the ultimate outcomes. There is no curative therapy to prevent the recurrence of ulcers, and all available treatment modalities can only reduce the frequency or severity of the lesions.},

We postulate that Candida albicans is a trigger in the onset of coeliac disease. The virulence factor of C albicans-hyphal wall protein 1 (HWP1)-contains aminoacid sequences that are identical or highly homologous to known coeliac disease-related alpha-gliadin and gamma-gliadin T-cell epitopes. HWP1 is a transglutaminase substrate, and is used by C albicans to adhere to the intestinal epithelium. Furthermore, tissue transglutaminase and endomysium components could become covalently linked to the yeast. Subsequently, C albicans might function as an adjuvant that stimulates antibody formation against HWP1 and gluten, and formation of autoreactive antibodies against tissue transglutaminase and endomysium.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A significant number of Australians and people from specific groups within the community are suffering from vitamin D deficiency. It is no longer acceptable to assume that all people in Australia receive adequate vitamin D from casual exposure to sunlight. OBJECTIVE: This article provides information on causes, consequences, treatment and prevention of vitamin D deficiency in Australia. DISCUSSION: People at high risk of vitamin D deficiency include the elderly, those with skin conditions where avoidance of sunlight is required, dark skinned people (particularly women during pregnancy or if veiled) and patients with malabsorption, e.g. coeliac disease. For most people, deficiency can be prevented by 5-15 minutes exposure of face and upper limbs to sunlight 4-6 times per week. If this is not possible then a vitamin D supplement of at least 400 IU per day is recommended. In cases of established vitamin D deficiency, supplementation with 3000-5000 IU per day for at least 1 month is required to replete body stores. Increased availability of larger dose preparations of cholecalciferol would be a useful therapy in the case of severe deficiencies.},

Altogether, 710 patients responded: 423 (73%) with celiac disease and 70 (55%) with dermatitis herpetiformis were currently consuming oats. Patients appreciated the taste, the ease of use, and the low costs; 94% believed that oats diversified the gluten-free diet; 15% of celiac disease and 28% of dermatitis herpetiformis patients had stopped eating oats. The most common reasons for avoiding oats were fear of adverse effects or contamination. There is a market demand for oats, and celiac societies and dietitians should make efforts to promote the development of products free of wheat contamination.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ghrelin, the gut-brain peptide, recently identified as the natural endogenous ligand for growth hormone secretagogue receptors, exerts various endocrine and nonendocrine effects, including the control of energy homeostasis and food intake, but its possible relevance in malabsorption syndromes is unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate circulating ghrelin levels in adults with untreated and treated celiac disease (CD) and, for comparison, in healthy subjects. METHODS: Fasting serum ghrelin levels were measured in 30 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed CD, 13 celiac patients successfully treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD), and 30 healthy controls. RESULTS: Ghrelin levels were abnormally high in patients with active CD compared with controls (297 +/- 17.6 vs 218 +/- 15.2 pmol/L, p<0.01) and correlated positively with intestinal mucosal lesion severity (rs=0.444, p<0.02). In the successfully GFD-treated patients, ghrelin values were normal compared with controls (233 +/- 22.0 vs 218 +/- 15.2 pmol/L, ns) and, moreover, correlated negatively with body mass index (r=-0.632, p=0.02), unlike in the untreated patient group (r=-0.263, ns). CONCLUSION: High ghrelin levels characterized our series of adult patients with newly diagnosed CD and correlated significantly with the degree of severity of intestinal mucosal lesions. This is the first evidence of a relationship between ghrelin and inflammatory processes, but the mechanisms involved are still unclear. Furthermore, our findings suggest that an interplay of hormonal, metabolic, and nutritional factors could influence ghrelin secretion under pathophysiological circumstances.},

   abstract = {Infant food allergies are increasing, and many breast-fed infants now sensitize to maternally-ingested antigens. As low-dose oral tolerance requires generation of suppressor lymphocytes producing TGF-beta1 (Th3 cells), we studied these cells in duodenal biopsies after diagnostic endoscopy. Spontaneous production of Th1, Th2 and Th3 cytokines by duodenal lymphocytes was studied using flow cytometry in 20 children with no eventual clinico-pathological diagnosis (controls), 30 children with multiple food allergy, nine with celiac disease and six with inflammatory enteropathies. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization were used to localize TGF-beta1 protein and mRNA in matched biopsies. We found no significant Th1/Th2 skewing amongst mucosal lymphocytes in allergic children compared to controls, although celiac and inflammatory enteropathy patients showed increased Th1 responses. By contrast, the allergic children showed reduction of TGF-beta1(+) lymphocytes in both epithelial and lamina propria compartments. Reduction of TGF-beta1 expression was also seen in mononuclear cells and epithelium in food allergy by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. The dominant mucosal abnormality in food allergic children was, thus, not Th2 deviation but impaired generation of Th3 cells. As generation of these cells requires innate immune response to enteric bacteria, we suggest that changing infectious exposures may inhibit primary establishment of basic oral tolerance mechanisms.},

Necessary nutrients must be absorbed and commensal bacteria tolerated, and foreign proteins, antigens, and pathogens must be simultaneously excluded or destroyed. Immaturity or disruption of the mucosal immune defenses increases vulnerability to food allergy, intolerance, and infectious disease. Diseases resulting from ingested foreign proteins and organisms are increasing and cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is no specific treatment for food allergy other than avoidance. Vaccination for infectious disease is limited by the cost and logistics of distribution and administration, particularly in developing countries. Novel strategies are being explored to modulate the gut mucosal immune system by altering protein expression in food. Crops are being developed to remove deleterious allergens to prevent immunogenic exposure while preserving nutritional quality. Local food plants that express protein fragments of pathogens might provide an effective means to stimulate gut mucosal immunity while increasing vaccine accessibility.},

   abstract = {Leptin is a hormone secreted into the systemic blood primarily by white adipose tissue. However, leptin also is synthesized and stored by cells in the gastric mucosa. Because gastric mucosal leptin is secreted in response to ingestion of a meal, we hypothesized that it might contribute to satiation (meal termination) by acting on gastrointestinal vagal afferent neurons. To test whether leptin is capable of acutely reducing short-term food intake, we measured consumption of a liquid meal (15% sucrose) following low-dose leptin administration via the celiac artery, which perfuses the upper gastrointestinal tract. Leptin (1, 3, 10 mug) was infused via a chronically implanted, nonocclusive celiac arterial catheter or via a jugular vein catheter with its tip in the right cardiac atrium. Fifteen percent sucrose intake was then measured for 30 min. We found that leptin dose dependently inhibited sucrose intake when infused through the celiac catheter but not when infused into the general circulation via a jugular catheter. Plasma leptin concentrations in the general circulation following celiac arterial or jugular leptin infusions were not significantly different. Celiac arterial leptin infusion did not reduce meal size in vagotomized or capsaicin-treated rats. Finally, we also found that reduction of meal size by celiac leptin infusion was markedly enhanced when coinfused with cholecystokinin, a gastrointestinal satiety peptide whose action depends on vagal afferent neurons. Our results support the hypothesis that leptin contributes to satiation by a mechanism dependent on gastrointestinal vagal afferent innervation of the upper gastrointestinal tract.},

Diagnosis of celiac sprue is based on proof of histopathological changes in jejunum mucosa as a result of presence of gluten in food. In recent years, serum endogenous myosin and tissue transglutaminase antibodies were used in a diagnostic algorithm. We distinguish active, silent, latent, and potential celiac sprue. Simultaneous incidence of type I diabetes mellitus and celiac sprue has been documented in a range of studies. Both diseases have common immunology and genetic characters. Prevalence of celiac sprue in patients with type I diabetes is several times higher compared to prevalence of this disease in the population. There is the prevalence of celiac sprue 3.6-5.1% in children with type I diabetes mellitus in the Czech Republic, silent form of the disease is the most frequent one. An effect of a strict gluten free diet on a metabolic control of diabetes has not been proved. It is necessary to assess (at least once per two years) actively and on regular basis endogenous myosin and/or tissue transglutaminase antibodies in patients with type I diabetes.},

   abstract = {About 10,000 years ago domestication and farming of wheat and other cereals developed in the 'Fertile Crescent', an area including modern Turkey, Iraq and Iran. Agriculture then slowly spread from Middle East to Europe. Coeliac disease is the permanent intolerance to dietary gluten, the major protein component of wheat. It has been until relatively recently hypothesised that wheat consumption exerted a negative selective pressure on genes predisposing to coeliac disease, eventually leading to higher coeliac disease frequency in Northeastern Europe because of lack of exposure to cereals. This theory is at variance with recent studies showing that coeliac disease is as common in Middle Eastern countries as in Europe. High prevalence of coeliac disease has been found in Iran, in both the general population and at-risk groups, e.g. patients with irritable bowel syndrome or type 1 diabetes. Clinical manifestations of coeliac disease vary markedly with the age of the patient, the duration and the extent of disease. Clinical studies showed that presentation with non-specific symptoms or no symptoms is as common in the Middle East as in Europe. Wheat represented a major component of the Iranian diet for many centuries and it may be argued that the continuous and high level of exposure to wheat proteins has induced some degree of immune tolerance, leading to milder symptoms that may be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome or unexplained gastrointestinal disorders. The gluten-free diet represents a real challenge to both patients and clinicians in this area. This is particularly difficult in the absence of any supply for gluten-free diet in Middle Eastern countries.},

   abstract = {Intolerance of gluten, resposible for Coeliac disease, is essentially shown by an auto-immune enteropathy, even if the cutaneous manifestation (herpetiform dermatitis) and perhaps certain neurological signs (cerebral syndrome, peripheral neuropathy) may be independent as well as associated with the intestinal illness. This affection is of immunological nature, occuring in a genetic field that predisposes to the illness (familial form: concordance of 70% in homozygote twins; 90% of patients show an HLA molecule of type DQ2, DQ8 in almost all the other cases. The exogenous factor is the gluten content contained in wheat, rye and barley, more precisely by the intermediary "the prolamines" which are the "reactive" element that induces a the same time an inflammatory reaction of type TH11 locally (expressed by the histological aspect of a duodenal biopsy evolving as villous atrophy) and a humoral response with production of anti-gliadine and anti-transglutaminase antibodies (the role of the latter enzyme is intervention in the local transformation of antigens to make them antigenic). It is an illness of adults as well as children and this point must now be emphasized. Recent epidemiological studies insist on a high prevalence (1/300 in Europe). Clinical expression, at the start very polymorphic and so misleading, before the appearance of the more classical signs of malabsorption and development, always feared, towards a lymphoma. These signs are haematological (anemia of various types, hyper platelets by hyposplenism, haemorrhagic signs) cutaneous (herpetiform dermatitis, cutaneous vasculitis) mucosal (aphtose), hepatic (cytolysis), neurophysical (fatigue, troubles of behaviour, cerebral syndrome, neuropathy) and osteo-articulitis (osteopenia, arthralgias, diffuse pains). The association of certain auto-immune illnesses must be emphasized (diabetes, Hashimoto thyroiditis, Gougerot disease, primitive biliary cirrhosis). To think early of the possibility of intolerance to gluten, is to give the means of a very easy diagnosis (measurement of anti-gliadin, anti-endomysium and anti-transglutaminase, and secondarily duodenal biopsy if necessary), and it is early elimination of gluten food which will make the various clinical manifestations disappear and so prevent the risk of evolution to a tumoral pathology.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Magnesium deficiency has been reported in coeliac disease (CD) with clinical symptoms. The aim of this study was to evaluate magnesium status in CD without malabsorption symptoms in patients aged 5-18 years. In the study participated 41 coeliac patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD) for a mean 11 years with IgAEmA (-) and normal villi, 28 patients with untreated subclinical (atypical) CD with IgAEmA (+) and villous atrophy, and 8 healthy subjects as a control group. METHOD: Magnesium status was examined by an intravenous Mg loading test, determination of serum and erythrocyte Mg concentrations, and urinary excretion. Steatorrhea was assessed by fecal fat excretion. Magnesium, calcium, protein, and fat intake were evaluated by a food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: The frequency of magnesium deficiency as assessed by the magnesium loading test was: 19.6% in treated, 21.4% in untreated CD patients, and 25% in control group, similar in both sexes, sporadic in small towns (3.8%), frequent in large cities and rural villages (23.5% vs. 32.3%). Fat excretion was within normal limits. The following results were found, respectively: decreased serum magnesium concentration, 7.3% vs. 3.6% vs. 0%, decreased erythrocyte Mg concentration, 14.6% vs. 25% vs. 12.5%; decreased intake of magnesium, 29% vs. 32% vs. 0%. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of magnesium deficiency was similar in pediatric patients who were treated for CD or in patients with subclinical CD, and in control group; magnesium deficiency in patients participating in our study depended on an imbalanced diet.},

   abstract = {In most individuals minute amounts of food proteins pass undegraded across the intestinal mucosa and trigger antibody formation. Children with coeliac disease have enhanced antibody production against gliadin as well as other dietary antigens, e.g. beta-lactoglobulin, in cow's milk. Antibody avidity, i.e. the binding strength between antibody and antigen, often increases during antibody responses and may be related to the biological effectiveness of antibodies. The aim of the present study was to determine the avidity of serum IgG antibodies against beta-lactoglobulin and gliadin in healthy children during early childhood and compare these avidities to those found in children with coeliac disease. The average antibody avidity was analysed using a thiocyanate elution assay, whereas the antibody activity of the corresponding sera was assayed by ELISA. The avidity of serum IgG antibodies against beta-lactoglobulin as well as gliadin increased with age in healthy children, even in the face of falling antibody titres to the same antigens. Children with untreated coeliac disease had IgG anti-beta-lactoglobulin antibodies of significantly higher avidity than healthy children of the same age, and the same trend was observed for IgG antigliadin antibodies. The present data suggest that the avidities of antibodies against dietary antigens increase progressively during early childhood, and that this process seems to be accelerated during active coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food allergy (FA) is characterized by an abnormal immunologic reactivity to food proteins. The gastro-intestinal tract serves not only a nutritive function but also is a major immunologic organ. Although previously thought to be triggered primarily by an IgE-mediated mechanism of injury, considerable evidence now suggests that non-IgE mechanisms may also be involved in the pathogenesis of FA. OBJECTIVE: To review the immunologic disturbances that occur in FA and to correlate these with the clinical manifestations expressed in affected target organs based upon a classification of IgE and non-IgE mechanisms. METHODS: Data collected from a computerized MEDLINE search were used for the analysis of the following topics: immediate GI hypersensitivity, oral allergy syndrome, acute urticaria and angioedema, acute bronchospasm, celiac disease, cow's milk enteropathy, dietary protein enterocolitis, breast milk colitis, proctolitis, proctitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, Heiner syndrome, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, atopic dermatitis, asthma, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder and behavioral disorders, as well as systems affected by mucosal associated lymphoid tissue-mediated injury of associated lymphoid tissues and the immunologic deviation to Th1 or Th2 mechanisms of FA. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review allow the construction of a central, unifying hypothesis for a new classification of FA as follows: the clinical manifestations of FA, expressed in affected target organs, may be the result of immunologic injury mediated by interaction of food antigens with contiguous elements of mucosal associated lymphoid tissue. These appear to be modulated by relative imbalances of the Th1/Th2 paradigm, which may be the ultimate determinant governing the expression of FA as IgE-mediated, non--IgE-mediated, or mixed forms of IgE/non-IgE mechanisms of FA.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an enteropathy characterized by a Th1-type immune response to the dietary gluten. The transcriptional mechanisms or factors that control Th1 cell development in this condition remain to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to analyze in CD the expression of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF)-1, a transcription factor that regulates the differentiation and function of Th1 cells. Duodenal biopsies were taken from children with untreated CD and control children, and analyzed for IRF-1 by Southern blotting of reverse-transcriptase PCR products and Western blotting. IRF-1 DNA-binding activity was assessed by electrophoretic shift mobility assay. The effect of gliadin stimulation on IRF-1 induction was investigated in an ex vivo organ culture of treated CD biopsies. Enhanced IRF-1 was seen in untreated CD in comparison with controls. This was evident at both the RNA and protein level. Furthermore, untreated CD samples exhibited stronger nuclear accumulation and DNA-binding activity of IRF-1 than controls. In contrast, IRF-2, a transcriptional repressor that binds the same DNA element and competes with IRF-1, was expressed at the same level in nuclear proteins extracted from both untreated CD and control patients. In explant cultures of treated CD biopsies, gliadin enhanced both IRF-1 RNA and protein. This effect was prevented by a neutralizing IFN-gamma antibody. Furthermore, stimulation of normal duodenal biopsies with IFN-gamma enhanced IRF-1. These data indicate that IRF-1 is a hallmark of the gliadin-mediated inflammation in CD and suggest that IFN-gamma/IRF-1 signaling pathway can play a key role in maintaining and expanding the local Th1 inflammatory response in this disease.},

Male rats were fitted with intraduodenal (ID) catheters and given subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (SDA), celiac-superior mesenteric ganglionectomy (CGX), combined (COM) treatments, or sham surgery. In separate conditioning trials, they were trained to drink (30 min/day) flavored saccharin solutions paired with concurrent ID infusions of 8% maltodextrin or water and 3.55% corn oil or water. Experiment 1 revealed that SDA and sham rats showed equal preferences for the nutrient-paired flavors over the water-paired flavors. In contrast, SDA rats, unlike sham rats, failed to suppress their intake of a palatable fluid when infused intraduodenally with maltodextrin or corn oil. Experiment 2 revealed that CGX, COM and sham rats all developed preferences for the maltodextrin-paired flavor, although CGX alone or COM attenuated the conditioned preference. CGX and COM treatments also attenuated or blocked the feeding inhibitory actions of ID nutrient infusions. These findings along with prior data indicate that gut vagal afferents and splanchnic nerves are not essential for flavor-nutrient preference conditioning, whereas both vagal afferents and splanchnic nerves are implicated in carbohydrate- and fat-induced satiation.},

METHODS: Thirty patients with asymptomatic CD (17 children, 13 adolescents), on a gluten-free diet, and 23 healthy subjects were studied. BMD of the lumbar spine (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) was performed on all patients and control subjects. In patients, food diaries for nine nonconsecutive days were obtained and analyzed. In patients, laboratory tests pertaining to calcium balance were obtained. RESULTS: The mean weight and height of the adolescents with CD were lower than those of control subjects (weight: 45.8 +/- 10.5 kg v 55.3 +/- 10.5 kg, P = 0.037; height: 153.0 +/- 11.0 cm v 167 +/- 12.0 cm, P = 0.007). The mean BMD in adolescents with CD was significantly lower than that of the control subjects (0.917 +/- 0.116 g/cm2 v 1.060 +/- 0.158 g/cm2, P = 0.015), whereas no significant difference was found between children with CD and control subjects (P = 0.595). A multiple-regression model shows that increases in BMD relative to height were lower in adolescents with CD than in control subjects. The proportion of adolescents who had started a gluten-free diet after 2 years of age was higher than that of children with CD (P < 0.001). High percentages of magnesium, calcium, and phosphorous deficiencies were present in CD patients' diets. The serum levels of ionized and total calcium and parathormone were normal. CONCLUSIONS: The BMD of adolescents with CD was lower than that of the control subjects, whereas no difference was found between the BMD of children with CD and that of control subjects.},

The named disorders include immediate gastrointestinal hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis), oral allergy syndrome, allergic eosinophilic esophagitis, gastritis, and gastroenterocolitis; dietary protein enterocolitis, proctitis, and enteropathy; and celiac disease. Additional disorders sometimes attributed to food allergy include colic, gastroesophageal reflux, and constipation. The pediatrician faces several challenges in dealing with these disorders because diagnosis requires differentiating allergic disorders from many other causes of similar symptoms, and therapy requires identification of causal foods, application of therapeutic diets and/or medications, and monitoring for resolution of these disorders. This review catalogs the spectrum of gastrointestinal food allergies that affect children and provides a framework for a rational approach to diagnosis and management.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is now generally accepted that coeliac disease (CD) is caused by inflammatory T cell responses to gluten peptides bound to HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 molecules. There is overwhelming evidence that CD patients can mount T cell responses to peptides found in both alpha-gliadin and gamma-gliadin molecules. Assays that would detect the presence or absence of such peptides in food would thus be accurate indicators of safety for consumption by CD patients. AIMS: The development of a sensitive method to detect T cell stimulatory epitopes of alpha-gliadin and gamma-gliadin molecules in food products. METHODS: Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were raised against peptides encoding the T cell stimulatory epitopes of alpha-gliadin (amino acids (aa) 59-71) and aa gamma-gliadin (aa 142-153 and aa 147-159). These mAb competition assays were developed that quantitatively detect T cell stimulatory epitopes present on both intact proteins and peptides of sizes recognisable by CD4(+) T cells. RESULTS: With the mAb based competition assays, T cell epitopes were detected in pepsin/trypsin digests of wheat proteins and ethanol extracts of various food products, with detection levels lower than those reached with gluten specific T cells. Moreover, the presence of T cell stimulatory epitopes was also detected in preparations of barley, rye, and triticale, other cereals known to be toxic for CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: A new antibody based method has been developed, detecting the presence of T cell stimulatory gluten peptides. This can be used to further ensure the safety of food consumed by CD patients.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the nutritional and symptomatic effects of including oats in the gluten-free diet, as well as the patients' subjective experiences. Twenty adult coeliac patients included large amounts of oats in their diet. Food intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, blood samples and body weight were examined and compared with examination at baseline. Diet compliance was checked monthly. The results are based on fifteen patients eating oats for 2 years plus three with only 6-months consumption. The median daily intake of oats was 93 (range 27-137) g/d, and the compliance was good. The mean intakes of Fe and dietary fibre increased (P<0.001) with the oat diet, as well as the intakes of thiamin and Zn (P<0.02). The bioavailability of Fe tended to decrease; this seems not to have influenced the Fe status. Temporary increased flatulence was experienced the first few weeks, as well as improved bowel function with oats in the diet. All patients who carried out the whole study period wanted to continue eating oats after the study, as they found that addition of oats in the gluten-free diet gave more variation, better taste and satiety. Oats improved the nutritional value of the gluten-free diet, had no negative effects on nutritional status and were appreciated by the subjects. Including oats can help coeliac patients following a strict gluten-free diet.},

However, little is known in regards to the allergenicity of gliadin in atopic dermatitis.

Since there are many repeated sequences in gliadin, peptides containing each motif were synthesized to evaluate their IgE-binding abilities. As a result, QQPFP and PQQPF were found to be epitopes (minimum structures for the IgE-binding). Gliadin might crosslink patient's IgE-antibodies via these epitopes and trigger subsequent allergic reactions.},

In 1995, the largest and most scientifically rigorous study on the safety of oats was published. Investigators concluded that the consumption of oats was safe for adults with celiac disease. Since 1995, several additional studies have been published. Without exception, these investigations found no adverse effects associated with the regular consumption of moderate amounts of oats. However, there are concerns among some authorities on celiac disease that even if oats themselves are safe, they nonetheless may be contaminated with wheat, rye, or barley. Unfortunately, the extent to which contamination of commercial oat products occurs is not known. Ideally, if a patient appears likely to use oats, they should be advised to consume only those products tested and found to be free of contamination.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The association between celiac disease and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is well established. Rectal gluten challenge has been used in patients with celiac disease and in first degree relatives as a tool to assess the mucosal immune response to gluten. The aim of this study was to assess the mucosal immune response to gluten in IDDM children by rectal gluten challenge. METHODS: Rectal biopsy specimens were obtained from 19 children with IDDM before and 6 h after rectal challenge with 2 g of a peptic tryptic digest of gliadin. A total of 16 treated celiac patients and 10 control subjects were also investigated. Epithelium and lamina propria CD3(+) and gamma delta(+) lymphocytes were counted with reference to a standard reference area of muscularis mucosae (10(4) microm(2)). RESULTS: After a local instillation of gliadin, a significant (>mean + 1 SD) percentage increment of lamina propria and epithelium CD3(+) and of lamina propria and epithelium gamma delta(+) lymphocytes was observed in five IDDM children, as compared to 11 and 13 celiac patients and one and two controls, respectively. A discriminant analysis allowed correct classification of 100% of patients with celiac disease and controls. The same analysis classified four of 19 IDDM children in the group of celiac patients. The positivity was associated with normal serology (antigliadin antibody, antiendomysial antibody, and antitissue transglutaminase antibodies) and a morphologically normal jejunal mucosa. All four patients had HLA-DQ alleles associated with celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 20% of IDDM children react to rectal instillation of gliadin. Long term follow-up is necessary to establish whether these subjects are at increased risk for developing celiac disease.},

   abstract = {It is quite frequent to recognize celiac patients who show gastrointestinal motor abnormalities in clinical practice. In fact, in 30 to 60% of patients, physical examination and dyspeptic symptoms (epigastric discomfort, early satiety) suggest a gastrointestinal motility disorder. Consistent data are now available on the presence of a disturbed motility of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, gallbladder, and colon of untreated celiac patients. Gastrointestinal abnormalities differ in different gastrointestinal districts. In fact, esophageal transit, gastric and gallbladder emptying, and orocecal transit time are delayed, while colonic transit is faster. These findings are related to the complex interactions among reduced absorption of food constituent (in particular, fat), neurologic alteration, and hormonal derangement. Motility disorders of the gut are also a predisposing factor in the development of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and may contribute both to development of symptoms in some untreated celiacs and to the persistence of symptoms after gluten-free diet in some of them. All these alterations fortunately disappear after gluten-free diet, and patients return to well being status. Whatever the initial event in the pathogenesis of the celiac lesions may be, we know for certain at this time that gastrointestinal disturbances play an important role in the genesis of gastrointestinal symptoms in celiac disease and that surveillance for celiac disease in patients complaining of dysmotility-like dyspeptic symptoms should be increased.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestation, and most celiac patients respond to a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, in some rare cases celiacs continue to experience GI symptoms after GFD, despite optimal adherence to diet. The aim of our study was to evaluate the causes of persistence of GI symptoms in a series of consecutive celiac patients fully compliant to GFD. METHODS: We studied 15 celiac patients (five men, 10 women, mean age 36.5 yr, range 24-59 yr) who continued to experience GI symptoms after at least 6-8 months of GFD (even if of less severity). Antigliadin antibody (AGA) test, antiendomysial antibody (EMA) test, and sorbitol H2-breath test (H2-BT), as well as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with histological evaluation, were performed before starting GFD. Bioptic samples were obtained from the second duodenal portion during EGD, and histopathology was expressed according to the Marsh classification. To investigate the causes of persistence of GI symptoms in these patients, we performed AGA and EMA tests, stool examination, EGD with histological examination of small bowel mucosa, and sorbitol-, lactose-, and lactulose H2-breath tests. RESULTS: Histology improved in all patients after 6-8 months of GFD; therefore, refractory celiac disease could be excluded. One patient with Marsh II lesions was fully compliant to his diet but had mistakenly taken an antibiotic containing gluten. Two patients showed lactose malabsorption, one patient showed Giardia lamblia and one patient Ascaris lumbricoides infestation, and 10 patients showed small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) by lactulose H2-BT. We prescribed a diet without milk or fresh milk-derived foods to the patient with lactose malabsorption; we treated the patients with parasite infestation with mebendazole 500 mg/day for 3 days for 2 consecutive wk; and we treated the patients with SIBO with rifaximin 800 mg/day for 1 wk. The patients were re-evaluated 1 month after the end of drug treatment (or after starting lactose-free diet); at this visit all patients were symptom-free. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that SIBO affects most celiacs with persistence of GI symptoms after gluten withdrawal.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease is caused by T-cell responses to wheat gluten-derived peptides. The presence of such peptides in other widely consumed grains, however, has hardly been studied. METHODS: We have performed homology searches to identify regions with sequence similarity to T-cell stimulatory gluten peptides in the available gluten sequences: the hordeins of barley, secalins of rye, and avenins of oats. The identified peptides were tested for T-cell stimulatory properties. RESULTS: With 1 exception, no identical matches with T-cell stimulatory gluten peptides were found in the other grains. However, less stringent searches identified 11 homologous sequences in hordeins, secalins, and avenins located in regions similar to those in the original gluten proteins. Seven of these 11 peptides were recognized by gluten-specific T-cell lines and/or clones from patients with celiac disease. Comparison of T-cell stimulatory sequences with homologous but non-T-cell stimulatory sequences indicated key amino acids that on substitution either completely or partially abrogated the T-cell stimulatory activity of the gluten peptides. Finally, we show that single nucleotide substitutions in gluten genes will suffice to induce these effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the disease-inducing properties of barley and rye can in part be explained by T-cell cross-reactivity against gluten-, secalin-, and hordein-derived peptides. Moreover, the results provide a first step toward a rational strategy for gluten detoxification via targeted mutagenesis at the genetic level.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There is currently much call for a reliable enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol for determining gluten in foods to serve as a basis for further Codex Alimentarius regulations. Given its ability to recognize the potential coeliac-toxic epitope QQPFP, which occurs repeatedly in alpha-, gamma- and omega-gliadins, hordeins and secalins, the monoclonal antibody R5 raised against a secalin extract may prove to be an essential tool for gluten analysis. This study was designed to develop a highly sensitive and specific sandwich ELISA to quantify low levels of wheat, barley and rye prolamins in foods for coeliacs. METHODS: Simple sandwich ELISA based on the use of a single monoclonal antibody (R5) as both the coating and detection was developed. A quantitative cocktail gluten-extraction procedure for heat-processed foods was also tested. RESULTS: R5-ELISA was able to identify gliadins, hordeins and secalins with assay sensitivities of 0.78, 0.39 and 0.39 ng/ml, respectively. The assay's detection limit was 1.5 ng gliadins/ml (1.56 ppm gliadins, 3.2 ppm gluten). The system proved insensitive to the non-coeliac-toxic cereals maize, rice and oats, and was non-cultivar-dependent. It was also able to detect gliadins and hordeins in unprocessed and heat-processed wheat- and barley-based products, and to estimate the gluten content of hydrolysed foods. CONCLUSION: We present a new generation of a robust sandwich R5-ELISA with good reproducibility (8.7%) and repeatability (7.7%). Its gluten-detection limit of 3.2 ppm is lower than the existing threshold of 20-200 ppm. The ELISA, which is equally sensitive to barley, wheat and rye prolamins, is compatible with the quantitative cocktail extraction procedure for heat-processed foods. Along with the cocktail procedure, the Working Group on Prolamin Analysis and Toxicity is currently evaluating an R5-ELISA system as proposed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some patients with smoldering pancreatitis in the absence of necrosis, pseudocyst, and ductal disruption experience unremitting abdominal pain caused by persistent pancreatic inflammation. Experience with the use of pancreatic duct stents in this patient population was reviewed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data for 11 patients with smoldering pancreatitis who underwent ERCP with pancreatic duct stent placement were reviewed retrospectively. All patients had severe, daily pain that worsened with ingestion of food, had required narcotic analgesics for control of pain, had lost weight, and had persistently elevated serum levels of pancreatic enzymes as well as pancreatic inflammatory changes on CT (without necrosis or pseudocyst). Six patients were being treated with parenteral nutrition. OBSERVATIONS: The mean duration of symptoms from the onset of pancreatitis until pancreatic duct stent insertion was 74 days (range 14-151 days). Stents were placed for a mean of 7 weeks (range 2-19 weeks). Pancreatic stent placement provided permanent pain relief in 10 (91%) patients within a mean of 9 days (range 3-20 days); one patient had persistent symptoms requiring celiac plexus blockade after 5 months. Parenteral nutrition and treatment with narcotic agents were discontinued for 10 patients within a mean of 15 days (range 7-39 days) after pancreatic duct insertion. CONCLUSIONS: Smoldering pancreatitis may result from functional obstruction, possibly caused by edema or spasm, of the papillary orifice. Insertion of a stent into the pancreatic duct alleviates pain, enables early resumption of oral intake of food, and facilitates pancreatic duct drainage. It also may help to prevent complications arising from persistent pancreatic inflammation.},

METHODS: Seven children with untreated FA (uFA), seven children with treated FA (tFA) to cow milk and/or cereals, and five normal controls furnished duodenal biopsy specimens. Additionally, five pediatric patients with celiac disease were included, serving exclusively as positive controls for in situ hybridization. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-4 (IL-4), adhesion molecules, and activation markers were detected by immunohistochemistry, and expression of IFN-gamma and IL-4 messenger RNA was revealed by in situ hybridization. RESULTS: uFA patients had a higher density of IFN-gamma positive cells in the lamina propria than did tFA patients and controls (P = 0.053 and P = 0.018). Moreover, the uFA patients exhibited a higher proportion of crypt cells in mitosis than did tFA patients (P = 0.026), and stronger staining of HLA-DR in the crypts and increased density of gammadelta-T cell receptor-positive intraepithelial lymphocytes than did controls (P = 0.048 and P = 0.010). The densities of alpha(4)beta(7) positive cells in the lamina propria tended to be higher in controls than in uFA or tFA patients (P = 0.106, P = 0.073). Expression of IL-4 mRNA was significantly higher in celiac patients than in the other study groups (uFA P = 0.006, tFA P = 0.010; controls P = 0.029), and celiac patients showed higher expression of IFN-gamma mRNA than did tFA patients or controls (P = 0.017 and P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: As expected, Th1 dominance was present in the lamina propria of children with delayed-type FA. It may cause activation of epithelial cells and increase their turnover.},

   abstract = {Osteoporosis is a frequent complication in the course of various gastrointestinal disorders. Since its pathogenesis is complex, and incompletely understood in comparison to the well-known pathomechanism of postmenopausal osteoporosis, adequate management is difficult. We first summarize those therapeutic options which have strong evidence in postmenopausal osteoporosis and, thereafter, we review those in the context of different gastrointestinal diseases. Treatment of the underlying intestinal disorder seems to be most important to normalise altered bone metabolism and to prevent osteoporosis in patients with coeliac disease. In patients with osteoporosis associated with Crohn's disease, various treatment strategies (such as vitamin D, sodium fluoride, bisphosphonates) are discussed. In contrast to postmenopausal osteoporosis, interventional studies in secondary osteoporosis are often limited by the small study population and data about the efficacy of any treatment in prevention of fractures are therefore lacking. Well-conducted, controlled studies with the endpoint of preventing fractures are therefore required to optimise the treatment of osteoporosis in these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In normal conditions human gut mucosa is infiltrated with a large number of mononuclear cells due to continuous stimulation by luminal antigens. This state of "physiological" inflammation is tightly controlled, as several mucosal cells interact to maintain an appropriate local immune response. Moreover, gut-associated lymphoid tissue must constantly distinguish harmless antigens that are present in food and on commensal bacteria from pathogenic microbes. INTERVENTIONS AND RESEARCH: The oral administration of soluble protein antigens induces a state of systemic immunological unresponsiveness specific to the fed protein, termed oral tolerance. The two major mechanisms to explain oral tolerance are anergy/deletion of autoreactive lymphocytes and active suppression. Changes in the pathways of immune activation are detected in chronic intestinal inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease. CONCLUSION: An appreciation of the current knowledge of the gut immune system is of importance for understanding and development of new treatment modalities in chronic intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {Ferulic acid (FA) is one of the most abundant phenolic antioxidants in the human diet. Many studies have documented its beneficial properties. It is therefore essential to understand the absorption and metabolism of FA in detail. The purpose of this study was to confirm the hypothesis that FA is absorbed in rat stomach and metabolized mainly in the liver. We determined the recovery of FA and its metabolites (FA sulfate/glucuronides) in rat gastric contents, gastric mucosa, portal vein plasma, celiac arterial plasma, bile, and urine after 2.25 micromol FA was administered in 0.5 mL physiological saline and incubated for 25 min in situ in the stomach of rats. Within 25 min, 74 +/- 11% of the administered FA disappeared from the stomach; later, FA was recovered in both free and conjugated forms in plasma, bile, and urine. On the other hand, only free FA was detected in the gastric contents and mucosa; it was also detected in the portal vein plasma as 49 +/- 5% of the total FA (all forms of FA). However, the proportion of free FA in the celiac arterial plasma, bile, and urine decreased to 5-8%. These results indicate that FA can be quickly absorbed from the rat stomach, and then is likely metabolized mainly in the liver. Such novel information would be helpful in the use of FA as a nutrient supplement. For example, oral administration of FA in capsule form or in a form bonded with sugar esters may provide a more appropriate concentration of FA in the circulation, which may improve its proposed efficacy in preventing chronic disease.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Dietary factors modifying type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) risk have been proposed, but little is known if they trigger the islet autoimmunity that precedes clinical disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether breastfeeding duration, food supplementation, or age at introduction of gluten-containing foods influences the risk of developing islet autoantibodies. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective natural history cohort study conducted from 1989 to 2003 in inpatient/outpatient clinics in Germany. PARTICIPANTS: The BABYDIAB study follows newborn children of parents with type 1 DM. Eligibility requirements were met in 1610 children. Blood samples were obtained at birth, age 9 months, 2, 5, and 8 years. Dropout rate was 14.4% by age 5 years. Breastfeeding data were obtained by prospective questionnaires (91% complete), and food supplementation data were obtained by family interview (72% for food supplementation and 80% for age of gluten introduction). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Development of islet autoantibodies (insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, or IA-2 antibodies) in 2 consecutive blood samples. RESULTS: Life-table islet autoantibody frequency was 5.8% (SE, 0.6%) by age 5 years. Reduced total or exclusive breastfeeding duration did not significantly increase the risk of developing islet autoantibodies. Food supplementation with gluten-containing foods before age 3 months, however, was associated with significantly increased islet autoantibody risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-11.5; P =.01 vs children who received only breast milk until age 3 months). Four of 17 children who received gluten foods before age 3 months developed islet autoantibodies (life-table 5-year risk, 24%; SE, 10%). All 4 children had the high-risk DRB1*03/04,DQB1*0302 genotype. Early exposure to gluten did not significantly increase the risk of developing celiac disease-associated autoantibodies. Children who first received gluten foods after age 6 months did not have increased risks for islet or celiac disease autoantibodies. CONCLUSION: Ensuring compliance to infant feeding guidelines is a possible way to reduce the risk of development of type 1 DM autoantibodies.},

   abstract = {Although it generally does not improve performance, iron is often used by elite athletes. The physiologic changes induced by exercise can mimic iron deficiency and decrease hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations. Determination of serum transferrin receptor concentrations may identify true iron deficiency, which occurs particularly in young athletes. In contrast, increased iron stores in the body are a frequent finding in elite athletes who have used long-term iron supplementation. Elite runners have increased intestinal blood loss, but this usually can be compensated by enhanced absorption of dietary iron. The combination of exercise-induced hemolysis with enhanced intestinal blood loss in various endurance sports leads to severe abnormalities of routine tests, and extreme physical activity may be responsible for positive fecal occult blood determinations. Indiscriminate iron supplementation carries the risk of inducing hemochromatosis in individuals homozygous for the widespread C282Y allele of the HFE gene. This polymorphism is common and can be found in about 1% of individuals of Northern European descent; moreover, iron supplementation can modify the presentation of important underlying diseases such as celiac disease or colon carcinoma. In conclusion, iron supplements should be prescribed for athletes with iron-deficiency anemia and carefully monitored if given for prophylaxis; unless a therapeutic response occurs, investigations to establish the cause of iron deficiency should be initiated.},
