   abstract = {Despite much debate over a presumptively somatic vs psychological etiology of nonatopic food and chemical sensitivities, little systematic research has addressed the issues. The present study investigated self-reported illness from several common foods (wheat, dairy, eggs) and chemicals (pesticide, car exhaust, paint, perfume, new carpet), symptom patterns, and psychological profiles of a sample of young adult college students (n = 490, age 19.4 +/- 2.4, 52% female/48% male). Subjects were divided into 4 groups on the basis of sample medians for frequency of illness from the foods (FI) and chemicals (CI); high FI with high CI (FI/CI), high FI alone, high CI alone, and NOILL (low FI and CI). FI was associated with more defensiveness (denial of negativity) while CI was linked with more shyness (avoidance of novelty). Women outnumbered men in all groups (FI/CI: 61%; FI: 80% CI: 55%) except the NOILL (40% women). Nevertheless, the FI/CI, FI, and/or CI groups still had significantly higher total symptom scores as well as more indigestion, headache, and memory trouble than did the NOILL group, even after depression, anxiety, shyness, defensiveness, and gender were covaried. The illness groups reported significantly more limitation of foods that mobilize endogenous opioids or generate exogenous opioids (sweets, fats, bread) as well as more illness from opiate drugs, small amounts of beverage alcohol, and late meals. Nasal symptoms from pollens or animals were more common in the FI/CI (42%) and CI (42%) than in FI (26%) or NOILL (28%) groups. Premenstrual tension syndrome and irritable bowel were also more common in the FI/CI group. The findings indicate that young adults outside the clinical setting who are relatively higher in FI and/or CI have distinctive symptom and psychological patterns. Covariate analyses suggest that important symptoms in FI and CI individuals such as indigestion, headache, and memory problems may occur in addition to rather than as simply part of emotional distress. The data are consistent with a previously hypothesized role of olfactory-limbic and hypothalamic pathways and with a time-dependent sensitization model for illness from foods and chemicals.},

   abstract = {Whilst following up large numbers of patients with irritable bowel syndrome we got the impression that wholemeal wheat and bran products made people with the condition worse rather than better. One hundred consecutive new referrals, all of whom had tried bran, were questioned to resolve this issue. 55% of patients were made worse by bran whereas only 10% had found it helpful. With the exception of fruit, other forms of dietary fibre were not as detrimental and proprietary supplements were found to be beneficial. All symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome were exacerbated by bran, with bowel disturbance most often adversely affected, followed by abdominal distension and pain. The results of this study suggest that the use of bran in irritable bowel syndrome should be reconsidered. The study also raises the possibility that excessive consumption of bran in the community may actually be creating patients with irritable bowel syndrome by exacerbating mild, non-complaining cases.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is recognized to be a common cause of chronic diarrhea without failure to thrive in childhood. Several studies stressed the role of food intolerance as a major factor in the pathogenesis of IBS. The aim of this multicenter study was to investigate the offending role of food in IBS and to compare the therapeutic role of oral sodium cromoglycate versus elimination diet. 153 patients (mean age 4 years) with diarrhea (> 3 stools per day for four days in a week) and abdominal pain for about 10 months were enrolled in this trial. About half of the patients had a family history positive for atopy and 70% of the cases complained of intestinal symptoms after food ingestion. In 17% of the patients Skin Prick test (SPT) resulted positive to at least one food allergen and 87% of positive reactions to SPT was provoked by common foodstuffs. 87% of patients treated with elimination diet (rice, lamb, turkey, lettuce, carrots, sweet potatoes, pears, oil, tea, salt, mineral water, brown sugar) and 97% of patients treated with SCG (mean 63 mg/kg/day) for one month showed a significant improvement of intestinal symptoms. An elimination diet for several weeks can produce, beside a bad compliance (23% of patients admitted to our study didn't strictly follow diet regimen) also a nutritional deprivation. The results of this trial suggest that it's correct to investigate the role of food in children with diarrhea not due to organic diseases and diagnosed such as IBS and to use oral SCG to obtain the improvement of these symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: The importance of dietary fibres in treatment of irritable bowel syndrome increased during the last years. Yet the results of clinical studies on the different dietary fibres are not consistent. Therefore we decided to perform a controlled trial with a well defined group of patients to compare the effectiveness of wheat bran to psyllium seeds. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients each with irritable bowel syndrome group II to III were treated in an open, not controlled study design either with 3 times 3.25 g psyllium seeds or 3 times 7 g wheat bran daily. All patients entering the study had not been treated for at least 3 weeks before. The study comprised two treatment phases of two weeks each, separated by two weeks without any treatment, thus leading to a study duration of 6 weeks altogether. Parameters for evaluation were stool frequency and consistency and the symptoms pain and abdominal distention, measured by a score (1 to 4). RESULTS: In both treatments groups stool frequency and consistency improved apparently compared to the starting point or the two weeks treatment free time in between. The improvement of stool frequency was statistically significant (p < 0.0001) for both substances. Furthermore the effect of psyllium seeds exceeded that of wheat bran statistically significant in week 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 (p < 0.005). Other symptoms such as abdominal pain improved too by therapy, psyllium seeds again tending to show better results. A significant difference between both substances could be observed on the symptom abdominal distension. Whereas abdominal distension decreased under treatment with psyllium seeds it increased with wheat brain. This lead to discontinuation of the study in 5 cases, 3 of which could be changed successfully to psyllium seeds. The difference between psyllium seeds and wheat bran concerning the occurrence of abdominal distension was statistically significant (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of psyllium seeds and wheat bran on stool frequency and consistency of patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Psyllium seeds showed to be superior to wheat brain with respect to stool frequency and abdominal distension so that it should be preferred in treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and constipation.},

One therapeutic strategy is to increase dietary fiber intake and to eliminate gastrointestinal (GI) irritants such as caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco smoking. However, little work has been done to establish a relationship between dietary factors and chronic GI symptoms. In this article, the authors: (a) describe and compare caloric and dietary constituent intake in symptomatic (n = 18) and asymptomatic (n = 37) women, and (b) examine the relationships among diet, GI symptoms, and stool characteristics in the two groups. In particular, total calories, fiber, fat, protein, and carbohydrates as well as alcohol and caffeine intakes were compared in women who do not smoke. Because menstrual cycle phase modulates both symptoms and appetite, women were studied during the follicular phase. Groups had similar caloric, fat, and protein intakes. Fiber intakes were similar and similar to national norms in both groups. When compared with asymptomatic women, the symptomatic women consumed more refined carbohydrates. Relationships were observed among dietary intake of refined carbohydrates, fiber, GI symptoms, and stool characteristics in women with functional bowel disorder.},

   abstract = {First, it is important to find out whether the patient is complaining of infrequent defaecation, excessive straining at defaecation, abdominal pain or bloating, a general sense of malaise attributed to constipation, soiling, or a combination of more than one symptom. Second, one must decide if there is a definable abnormality as a cause of the symptom(s). Is the colon apparently normal or is its lumen widened (megacolon)? Is the upper gut normal or is there evidence of neuropathy or myopathy? Is the ano-rectum normal or is there evidence of a weak pelvic floor, mucosal prolapse, major rectocele, an internal intussusception or solitary rectal ulcer? Is there any systemic component such as hypothyroidism, hypercalcaemia, neurological or psychiatric disorder or relevant drug therapy? Choice of treatment will depend on this clinical evaluation. The range of treatments available is: Reassurance and stop current treatment: Patients with a bowel obsession may take laxatives or rectal preparations regularly without need. Increase dietary fibre: Most cases of 'simple' constipation respond to increased dietary fibre, possibly with an added supplement of natural bran. Toilet training and altered routine of life: Young people particularly may need to recognise the call to stool and alter their daily routine to permit and encourage regular defaecation. Medicinal bulking agent: Ispaghula, methyl cellulose, concentrated wheat germ or bran, and similar preparations are useful when patients with a normal colon find it difficult to take adequate dietary fibre. These preparations increase the bulk of stool and soften its consistency. They may be useful for those patients with the constipated form of irritable bowel syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Alimentary and non-alimentary symptoms, estimated daily dietary fibre intakes, ability to express personal feelings, anxiety and depression ratings, and life events and difficulties inventories were compared in 128 hospital out-patients with IBS and 113 age and sex matched control subjects not seeking health care, randomly recruited from the community. Alimentary symptoms correlated closely with those non-alimentary symptoms often associated with the hyperventilation syndromes, difficulties in expressing personal feelings and anxiety, and depression ratings. Life events and difficulties, and estimated daily dietary fibre intakes did not differ significantly between patients and controls. With the exception of abdominal bloating, no significant gender differences were observed in IBS symptoms in either the IBS or control groups. The irritable bowel syndrome is one facet of a more general condition of illness behaviour which includes the hyperventilation syndrome and an inassertiveness in expressing personal feelings. Though non-alimentary symptoms did not improve diagnostic accuracy beyond that achieved by a combination of alimentary symptoms, their recognition provides alternative approaches to the management of refractory IBS.},

When colonic motility is abnormal, the patient can experience either constipation or diarrhea in addition to abdominal pain and bloating. In constipated patients the postprandial colonic motility can increase normally after eating or the colon can remain motionless. Generally propagating contractions are absent in patients with constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Propagating contractions are increased in frequency in patients with diarrhea, although the phasic contractions are decreased. Questionnaires discriminate between patients with structural disease such as ulcerative colitis and patients with functional disease, however they cannot differentiate between the different subgroups of patients with constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome.

Patients with irritable bowel syndrome are frequently advised to increase their intake of bran fibre, despite inconclusive experimental evidence of benefit. METHODS: The effect of dietary supplementation with a bolus of bran fibre (12 g/day) was studied in a block-randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 80 patients with irritable bowel syndrome referred to a District General Hospital outpatient clinic. Comparison of the benefits of bran and placebo was based upon personal assessment of individual and overall symptom profiles, determined from a simple daily symptom score and post-treatment interview. RESULTS: Overall symptomatic improvement was reported with bran by 52% and with placebo by 54% of patients. Bran supplementation was no more effective than placebo in improving individual symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and for wind-related symptoms it was significantly less effective (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Dietary supplementation with bran is of no value in the treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome referred to a hospital clinic.},

An attempt was also undertaken at evaluation of the influence of depression on the immune system functions in these patients. Clinical reactions after meals were reported by 89% of the studied patients with ICS, and in 8% of these patients it was recognized that early allergic reaction to meals had been the pathological mechanism responsible for the observed reactions. The intensity of depression and the per cent of patients with depression were statistically higher in patients with ICS as compared with persons in the control group. The number of Ea rosette forming T-cells was decreased in patients with ICS significantly in comparison to controls. The numbers of T- and B-cells were decreased statistically significantly in patients with depression intensity of 50 and over 50 points as compared with those without depression. In certain patients other immunological abnormalities were also found, such as decreased serum IgA level combined with absence of that Ig in the large bowel mucosa. The studies carried out suggest the statement that abnormal reactions after meal are common in patients with ICS and the participation of type I allergy according to Gell and Coombs in these reactions has been shown in 8% of the studied patients, and that the participation of psychopathological changes should be considered in the aetiology and pathogenesis of this syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {In a group of 74 patients with irritable colon syndrome the studies were carried out evaluating the frequency of abnormal reactions after meal and positive skin reactions with extracts of inhalatory and alimentary substances, 0.1% histamine and 1% codeine. An assessment was also done of the correlation of skin reactions with the degree of irritability of the large bowel expressed as score. Abnormal reactions after meal were reported by 89% of the studied patients with irritable colon syndrome. All meals giving abnormal reactions after consumption may be the source of allergens and may trigger allergic reactions in predisposed persons, but many of them, in view of the contents of histamine, tyramine, and the ability of release or synthesis and release of mast cell mediators, may cause reactions of pseudoallergic mechanism. Intensity of skin reaction in the form of oedema and erythema after intracutaneously administered codeine varied between the studied groups. The highest intensity was found in patients with irritable colon syndrome (ICS) who had intermittent diarrhoeas. The intensity of oedematous skin reaction after codeine in patients with ICS was correlated with the degree of irritability of the large bowel evaluated by the accepted score. The obtained results may be an indirect evidence of the participation of pseudoallergic reaction in the pathological mechanism of ICS in certain patients.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome is one of the most common reasons for disability and health care seeking. A sensible strategy for management incorporates a confident diagnosis based upon history, physical examination, and pertinent tests. The physician can then reassure the patient, offer dietary and stress management advice, and recommend bran to relieve constipation and to evoke the placebo response. Patients who do not respond could require supportive psychotherapy or a drug for the dominant symptom. A few require careful referral, but overall responsibility should remain with the primary physician.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine which test would yield the most useful clinical data in evaluation of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: One hundred ninety-six patients who met the International Congress of Gastroenterology criteria for irritable bowel syndrome were prospectively evaluated with hematological, biochemical, and metabolic laboratory testing, as well as a structural evaluation of the colon. RESULTS: complete blood count, sedimentation rate (ESR), serum chemistries, thyroid profile, and urinalysis were normal or yielded no useful clinical information. Stool examinations for parasites were also normal. Structural evaluations (barium enema, x-ray, and flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) revealed abnormalities, including colon cancer (1), polyps (9), colitis (1), melanosis coli (2), diverticulosis (17), and hemorrhoids (11). Forty-eight subjects (25.8%) had lactose maldigestion confirmed by H2 breath lactose testing. Prior to formal testing, 25 (52%) of these subjects were unaware of the relationship between lactose-containing foods and their symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: 1) ESR, thyroid profiles, and parasite examinations had no diagnostic yield in this study and, without specific clinical indication from history and physical examination, should not be part of the "routine" IBS evaluation. 2) Lactose hydrogen breath testing is encouraged for patients with and without milk intolerance who present with IBS.},

   abstract = {In order to better understand the rectosigmoid motor activity in diverticular disease of the colon, we studied 186 patients, grouped according to their intestinal habit, the presence of diverticular disease and previous crisis of sigmoid diverticulitis. The intestinal habit was classified as: normal habit, irritable colon syndrome, diarrhea and constipation. The group of diverticulosis was classified by their intestinal habit and by diverticula localization (localized or generalized). The presence of systemic diseases or drug ingestion that could modify intestinal motility, were considered criteria for exclusion. The manometric study was preceded by food stimulus, with 650 kcal meal, by mechanic intestinal cleansing, with 500 ml of saline solution enema and by one hour resting period. A manometric catheter, was introduced by rectosigmoidoscopy, with open ended orifices situated at the sigmoid and upper rectum, respectively. The catheter was perfused by a capillary infusion system and the bowel pressures were registered for 30 minutes, in a thermal paper physiograph. We analyzed the % of activity, mean amplitude and motility index, by non parametric tests. No significant difference was observed between sexes. Difference or close to it were found for the groups with constipation, with or without diverticulosis, and for the latter in its subdivisions (localized, generalized and sigmoid diverticulitis). The rectal motor activity was similar in all groups. There was no difference for diverticulosis and its subdivision, when we take into account the several kinds of intestinal habits and the diverticula localization. The motility index averages showed low values for the sigmoid diverticulitis fact that suggests some dysfunction of this segment (hypocontractility). The key factor differentiating the groups was the presence of constipation and no influence was noted regarding the localization of diverticula or previous inflammatory process on intraluminal pressures. The fact that no difference was found in the mean amplitude or % of activity among patients with or without diverticulosis, suggests that the high pressures in a colonic segment, may not be responsible for the diverticular disease, and there must be other factors, besides motility, accounting for the development of the different forms of this disease.},
