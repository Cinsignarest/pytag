   abstract = {The diet of industrialized nations may contribute to the pathogenesis of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD). Malnutrition is relatively unusual in UC, but in CD, which often affects the small intestine, it is frequent and may be severe. Nutrition support is therefore frequently indicated. First principles of artificial nutrition can be applied effectively using the gut whenever possible. Parenteral nutrition is generally required only in those with short bowel syndrome. An increasing literature (especially in pediatrics) favors the use of defined exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) in the primary treatment of active CD. Controlled trials are, however, lacking, and recommendations are accordingly not of the highest rank. It appears that in this context, simple polymeric regimens are usually sufficient, and there is currently insufficient evidence to make a strong recommendation for disease-specific feeds. In the maintenance of remission in CD, controlled data demonstrate that defined EN reduces the risk of relapse requiring steroid treatment. There are no data in support of primary nutrition therapy in UC either in management of the acute flare or in maintenance. In conclusion, nutrition therapy in adults with inflammatory bowel disease is probably both undervalued and underused, but the evidence base needs to be strengthened to confirm its efficacy, determine better those patients most likely to benefit, and optimize the regimens to be employed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Vitamin D influences innate immunity, which is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). However, data examining vitamin D status in relation to risk of CD and UC are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 72,719 women (age, 40-73 y) enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. In 1986, women completed an assessment of diet and lifestyle, from which a 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] prediction score was developed and validated against directly measured levels of plasma 25(OH)D. Through 2008, we confirmed reported diagnoses of incident CD or UC through medical record review. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to examine the hazard ratio (HR) for incident CD or UC after adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: During 1,492,811 person-years of follow-up evaluation, we documented 122 incident cases of CD and 123 cases of UC. The median predicted 25(OH)D level was 22.3 ng/mL in the lowest and 32.2 ng/mL in the highest quartiles. Compared with the lowest quartile, the multivariate-adjusted HR associated with the highest quartile of vitamin D was 0.54 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-.99) for CD (P(trend) = .02) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.34-1.25) for UC (P(trend) = .17). Compared with women with a predicted 25(OH)D level less than 20 ng/mL, the multivariate-adjusted HR was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.15-0.97) for CD and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.19-1.70) for UC for women with a predicted 25(OH)D level greater than 30 ng/mL. There was a significant inverse association between dietary and supplemental vitamin D and UC, and a nonsignificant reduction in CD risk. CONCLUSIONS: Higher predicted plasma levels of 25(OH)D significantly reduce the risk for incident CD and nonsignificantly reduce the risk for UC in women.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the environmental factors leading to inflammatory bowel disease should help to prevent occurrence of the disease and its relapses. AIM: To review current knowledge on dietary risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library were searched for studies on diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Established non-diet risk factors include family predisposition, smoking, appendectomy, and antibiotics. Retrospective case-control studies are encumbered with methodological problems. Prospective studies on European cohorts, mainly including middle-aged adults, suggest that a diet high in protein from meat and fish is associated with a higher risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Intake of the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid may confer risk of ulcerative colitis, whereas n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be protective. No effect was found of intake of dietary fibres, sugar, macronutrients, total energy, vitamin C, D, E, Carotene, or Retinol (vitamin A) on risk of ulcerative colitis. No prospective data was found on risk related to intake of fruits, vegetables or food microparticles (titanium dioxide and aluminium silicate). CONCLUSIONS: A diet high in protein, particular animal protein, may be associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease and relapses. N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids may predispose to ulcerative colitis whilst n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid may protect. These results should be confirmed in other countries and in younger subjects before dietary counselling is recommended in high risk subjects.},

   abstract = {Traditionally, half of the direct costs associated with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) [Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)] have related to hospital inpatient treatment for a sub-group of more severely affected, often therapy-resistant individuals. The advent of effective but relatively expensive biological agents has increased the contribution of drugs to overall medical care costs. This has focussed interest on the relative cost effectiveness of rival therapies for IBD and, in particular, on the affordability of long-term biological therapy. The purpose of this article is to review the available literature on this topic and to identify areas for future research. Head-to-head trials of competing treatment options are uncommon and clinical trials have seldom addressed cost effectiveness. In UC, models have explored the cost utility of 'high-' versus 'standard-' dose 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) therapy and the theoretical impact of improved adherence with once-daily formulations. In CD, cost-utility models for anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) drugs versus standard care have suggested consistently that incremental benefits are achieved at increased overall cost. However, studies of varying design have produced a wide spectrum of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates, which highlights the challenges and limitations of existing modelling techniques.},

   abstract = {Intestinal epithelial barrier disruption is a feature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but whether barrier disruption precedes or merely accompanies inflammation remains controversial. Tight junction (TJ) adhesion complexes control epithelial barrier integrity. Since some TJ proteins reside in cholesterol-enriched regions of the cell membrane termed lipid rafts, we sought to elucidate the relationship between rafts and intestinal epithelial barrier function. Lipid rafts were isolated from Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells primed with the proinflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or treated with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin as a positive control for raft disruption. Rafts were also isolated from the ilea of mice in which colitis had been induced in conjunction with in vivo intestinal permeability measurements, and lastly from intestinal biopsies of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with predominantly mild or quiescent disease. Raft distribution was analyzed by measuring activity of the raft-associated enzyme alkaline phosphatase and by performing Western blot analysis for flotillin-1. Epithelial barrier integrity was estimated by measuring transepithelial resistance in cytokine-treated cells or in vivo permeability to fluorescent dextran in colitic mice. Raft and nonraft fractions were analyzed by Western blotting for the TJ proteins occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Our results revealed that lipid rafts were disrupted in IFN-gamma-treated cells, in the ilea of mice with subclinical colitis, and in UC patients with quiescent inflammation. This was not associated with a clear pattern of occludin or ZO-1 relocalization from raft to nonraft fractions. Significantly, a time-course study in colitic mice revealed that disruption of lipid rafts preceded the onset of increased intestinal permeability. Our data suggest for the first time that lipid raft disruption occurs early in the inflammatory cascade in murine and human colitis and, we speculate, may contribute to subsequent disruption of epithelial barrier function.},

   abstract = {Several substances, including glutamine and propionic acid but in particular butyric acid, have been proposed to be important for colonic health. beta-Glucans lead to the formation of comparatively high amounts of butyric acid, and germinated barley foodstuff obtained from brewer's spent grain (BSG), containing high amounts of beta-glucans and glutamine, has been reported to reduce the inflammatory response in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis. The present study examines how 3 barley products, whole grain barley, malt, and BSG, affect SCFA in the hindgut and serum of rats and whether the addition of Lactobacillus rhamnosus 271 to each of these diets would have further effects. Amino acids in plasma and the cecal composition of the microbiota were also analyzed. The butyric acid concentration in the distal colon and serum was higher in the malt groups than in the other groups as was the serum concentration of propionic acid. The concentrations of propionic and butyric acids were higher in the cecum and serum of rats given L. rhamnosus than in those not given this strain. The proportion of plasma glutamine and the cecal number of bifidobacteria were lower in the malt groups than in the other groups. L. rhamnosus decreased the number of cecal bifidobacteria, whereas plasma glutamine was unaffected. We conclude that malt together with L. rhamnosus 271 had greater effects on propionic and butyric acid concentrations in rats than the other barley products. This is interesting when developing food with effects on colonic health.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammation of the large bowel, predominantly affecting young adults of 20 to 30 years of age. Even though the majority of patients with limited and extensive UC can be managed medically, 20 to 30 % will require surgical intervention at some point in their life to gain control of the inflammatory process. The most common reason for urgent and emergency surgery is a lack of response to maximal medical inpatient therapy after five to ten days. Other indications include hemorrhage, free perforation, sepsis, and toxic megacolon. Procedure of choice for the majority of surgeons is open or laparoscopic subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy, with or without exteriorization of the rectal stump. The laparoscopic approach requires more time, but allows for faster return of bowel function and discharge from the hospital. Creation of a definite restoration in form of a J pouch should be delayed for at least three months. Indications for elective surgical intervention include cancer, dysplasia associated lesion or mass, and stricture. Preferably, the J pouch and Brooke ileostomy are performed in two stages, with a takedown of the ileostomy several months later. A single-stage operation is associated with increased anastomotic dehiscence, sepsis, and long-term pouch failure. The laparoscopic creation of a J pouch is largely dependent on the surgeon's experience, but results in a number of advantages, including faster return of bowel function, tolerance of diet, and discharge. Regardless of emergency, urgent, or elective surgical intervention, early involvement of a team of gastroenterologist, surgeon, nutritionist, and stoma nurse is essential in the management of severe UC to maximize a satisfactory patient outcome.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will be discussed.},

(LSRO) held a workshop, Prebiotics and the Health Benefits of Fiber: Future Research and Goals, in February 2011 to assess the current state of the science and the international regulatory environment for prebiotics, identify research gaps, and create a strategy for future research. A developing body of evidence supports a role for prebiotics in reducing the risk and severity of GI infection and inflammation, including diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, and ulcerative colitis as well as bowel function disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics also increase the bioavailability and uptake of minerals and data suggest that they reduce the risk of obesity by promoting satiety and weight loss. Additional research is needed to define the relationship between the consumption of different prebiotics and improvement of human health. New information derived from the characterization of the composition and function of different prebiotics as well as the interactions among and between gut microbiota and the human host would improve our understanding of the effects of prebiotics on health and disease and could assist in surmounting regulatory issues related to prebiotic use.},

   abstract = {Besides their possible effects on the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), some environmental factors can modulate the clinical course of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). This review is mainly devoted to describing the current knowledge of the impact of some of these factors on the outcome of IBD, with special emphasis on smoking and diet. Although the impact of smoking on the susceptibility to develop CD and UC is firmly established, its influence on the clinical course of both diseases is still debatable. In CD, active smoking is a risk factor for postoperative recurrence. Beyond this clinical setting, smoking cessation seems to be advantageous in those CD patients who were smokers at disease diagnosis, while smoking resumption may be of benefit in ex-smokers with resistant UC. The role of dietary habits on the development of IBD is far from being well established. Also, food intolerances are very frequent, but usually inconsistent among IBD patients, and therefore no general dietary recommendations can be made in these patients. In general, IBD patients should eat a diet as varied as possible. Regarding the possible therapeutic role of some dietary components in IBD, lessons should be drawn from the investigation of the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in CD. Low-fat diets seem to be particularly useful. Also, some lipid sources, such as olive oil, medium-chain triglycerides, and perhaps omega-3 fatty acids, might have a therapeutic effect. Fermentable fiber may have a role in preventing relapses in inactive UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIM: Despite their well known anti-inflammatory actions, the clinical usefulness of omega-3 PUFA in inflammatory bowel disease is controversial. We aimed to systematically review the available data on the performance of omega-3 PUFA as therapeutic agents in these patients. METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched for RCT of fish oil or omega-3 PUFA therapy in both active and inactive ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, without limitation on either the length of therapy or the form it was given, including nutritional supplements and enteral formula diets. Eligible articles were assessed for methodological quality on the basis of the adequacy of the randomisation process, concealment of allocation, blinding of intervention and outcome, possible biases, and completeness of follow-up. The five-point Oxford quality score was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 19 RCT were finally selected for this review. Overall, available data do not allow to support the use of omega-3 PUFA supplementation for the treatment of both active and inactive inflammatory bowel disease. Negative results are quite consistent in trials assessing the use of omega-3 PUFA to maintain disease remission, particularly ulcerative colitis, and to a lesser extent Crohn's disease. Trials on their use in active disease do not allow to draw firm conclusions mainly because the heterogeneity of design (ulcerative colitis) or their short number (Crohn's disease). In most trials, the appropriateness of the selected placebo is questionable. CONCLUSION: The present systematic review does not allow to make firm recommendations about the usefulness of omega-3 PUFA in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Despite the fact that the frequency of hypolactasia and lactose intolerance is similar in both chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis patients and the general population, the elimination of dairy products from the patient's diet is a habitual recommendation. Hypolactasia is common in Mexico, but its relation to chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis has not been established. AIMS: To evaluate lactose digestion and lactose intolerance in persons with chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with confirmed chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis diagnosis were included in the study (mean: 31 years, range: 15 to 38). Twenty-two patients presented with rectosigmoid involvement and the remaining patients with pancolitis. No patient showed inflammatory activity according to the Truelove-Witts criteria and all consumed dairy products before diagnosis. A prospective, controlled, double-blind, cross-over study was designed. Patients randomly received 12.5 g of lactose or maltose in 250 cc water- each test 72 hours apart - and ydrogen was measured in exhaled air before disaccharide ingestion and then every 30 minutes for 3 hours. Digestion was considered deficient when there was an increase in hydrogen of at least 20 ppm. Symptom intensities were evaluated by Visual Analog Scales before, during, and after the hydrogen test. Differences between the groups were contrasted with the Mann-Whitney U and the Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (46%) presented with deficient lactose digestion. No significant differences were found in the symptoms, extension, or progression of chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis between patients that could digest and those that could not digest lactose. No patient had symptom exacerbation with the disaccharides used. CONCLUSIONS: Lactose digestion deficiency frequency is similar in subjects with chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis and in healthy individuals in Mexico. We do not know whether higher doses could have some effect, but symptoms in patients with inactive chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis were not modified using 12.5 g of lactose/day.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) result from complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors. Low blood levels of vitamin B12 and folate and genetic variants of related target enzymes are associated with IBD risk, in population studies. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we evaluated the effects of a methyl-deficient diet (MDD, folate, vitamin B12 and choline) in an experimental model of colitis induced by dextran sodium sulphate (DSS), in rat pups from dams subjected to the MDD during gestation and lactation. Four groups were considered (n = 12-16 per group): C DSS(-) (control/DSS(-)), D DSS(-) (deficient/DSS(-)), C DSS(+) (control/DSS(+)) and D DSS(+) (deficient/DSS(+)). Changes in apoptosis, oxidant stress and pro-inflammatory pathways were studied within colonic mucosa. In rat pups, the MDD produced a decreased plasma concentration of vitamin B12 and folate and an increased homocysteine (7.8 +/- 0.9 versus 22.6 +/- 1.2 mumol/l, P < 0.001). The DSS-induced colitis was dramatically more severe in the D DSS(+) group compared with each other group, with no change in superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity, but decreased expression of caspase-3 and Bax, and increased Bcl-2 levels. The mRNA levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and protein levels of p38, cytosolic phospolipase A2 and cyclooxygenase 2 were significantly increased in the D DSS(+) pups and were accompanied by a decrease in the protein level of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)3, a negative regulator of TNF-alpha. MDD may cause an overexpression of pro-inflammatory pathways, indicating an aggravating effect of folate and/or vitamin B12 deficiency in experimental IBD. These findings suggest paying attention to vitamin B12 and folate deficits, frequently reported in IBD patients.},

   abstract = {In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), it is known that besides genetic and environmental factors (e.g. diet, drugs, stress), the microbiota play an important role in the pathogenesis. Patients with IBD have an altered microbiota (dysbiosis) and therefore, probiotics, defined as 'live micro-organisms that when administered in adequate amounts can confer a health benefit on the host', have been suggested as nutritional supplements to restore these imbalances. The best response on probiotics among the different types of IBD appears to be in the case of ulcerative colitis. Although probiotics show promise in IBD in both clinical and animal studies, further mechanistic studies are necessary to optimize the use of probiotics as supporting therapy in IBD. Murine models of experimental colitis have been used for decades to study this pathology, and these models have been proven useful to search for new therapeutic approaches. The purpose of this review is to summarize probiotic-host interaction studies in murine models of experimental colitis and to evaluate how these models can further help in understanding these complex interactions. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms behind the beneficial effects will assist in better and possibly more efficient probiotic formulations.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), results in substantial morbidity and is difficult to treat. New strategies for adjunct therapies are needed. One candidate is the semi-essential amino acid, L-arginine (L-Arg), a complementary medicine purported to be an enhancer of immunity and vitality in the lay media. Using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) as a murine colonic injury and repair model with similarities to human UC, we assessed the effect of L-Arg, as DSS induced increases in colonic expression of the y(+) cationic amino acid transporter 2 (CAT2) and L-Arg uptake. L-Arg supplementation improved the clinical parameters of survival, body weight loss, and colon weight, and reduced colonic permeability and the number of myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils in DSS colitis. Luminex-based multi-analyte profiling demonstrated that there was a marked reduction in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression with L-Arg treatment. Genomic analysis by microarray demonstrated that DSS-treated mice supplemented with L-Arg clustered more closely with mice not exposed to DSS than to those receiving DSS alone, and revealed that multiple genes that were upregulated or downregulated with DSS alone exhibited normalization of expression with L-Arg supplementation. Additionally, L-Arg treatment of mice with DSS colitis resulted in increased ex vivo migration of colonic epithelial cells, suggestive of increased capacity for wound repair. Because CAT2 induction was sustained during L-Arg treatment and inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) requires uptake of L-Arg for generation of NO, we tested the effect of L-Arg in iNOS(-/-) mice and found that its benefits in DSS colitis were eliminated. These preclinical studies indicate that L-Arg supplementation could be a potential therapy for IBD, and that one mechanism of action may be functional enhancement of iNOS activity.},

This concept may explain the observation of the existence of higher significant percentage of severe disease in Caucasian patients with IBD comparable with the respected Asian patients who consume less.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The efficacy of germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) on tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and -8 (IL-8) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) has not yet been examined. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of administration of GBF on serum TNF-alpha, IL-6 and -8 levels in UC patients in remission. METHODS: Forty-one patients with UC were divided into two groups, namely control and GBF group. Twenty-one patients in the control group received standard treatment while 20 patients in the GBF group received 30 g of GBF daily by oral administration during two months of the study along with standard drug therapy. RESULTS: Levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and -8 all decreased in the GBF group compared with baseline during the two-month study, while in the control group all values rose. For IL-6 and -8 this effect was significant, P = 0.034 and 0.013, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study showed that the consumption of GBF may reduce the level of serum TNF-alpha, IL-6 and -8 in patients with UC. This investigation was designed as a pilot study and the results may provide a basis for more future clinical trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A three-stage restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the treatment of choice for the particularly debilitated patient with medically refractory ulcerative colitis (UC). Laparoscopic surgery has been shown to offer several advantages over the open approach in this setting. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is an emerging minimally invasive strategy representing a truly scarless procedure for the first surgical step, namely, the total abdominal colectomy (TAC). METHODS: Nine consecutive patients with medically refractory UC underwent a single-incision laparoscopic TAC between May and October 2010. All patients were on aggressive medical therapy with corticosteroids or immunosuppressors and were selected for this approach on the basis of their body habitus and the absence of relevant comorbidities. The whole operation was performed through a single access to the abdominal cavity, placed at the ostomy site marked preoperatively. RESULTS: Mean operating time was 142 +/- 23 min, with an estimate blood loss of 108 +/- 125 ml. No intraoperative complications or conversions to conventional laparoscopy or open surgery occurred. In all cases the postoperative course was uneventful. The return of bowel function was observed on postoperative day 1.7 +/- 0.7, and patients could tolerate a solid diet on postoperative day 3 +/- 0.5. The mean postoperative length of stay was 5.2 +/- 1.3 days. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, a single-incision laparoscopic approach to total abdominal colectomy for refractory ulcerative colitis has been shown to be safe and feasible. Initial results suggest that this technique can lead to improvements in short-term outcomes in selected patients.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Total abdominal colectomy is the procedure of choice for debilitated patients with acute, medical refractory ulcerative colitis in our practice. A laparoscopic approach has been previously shown to be safe and effective, and has become our preferred strategy. This study illustrates the laparoscopic evolution towards a truly minimally invasive approach comparing three phases of a single colorectal surgeon experience. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In May 2010 single incision laparoscopy was introduced in our practice and has become our preferred approach. Ten consecutive ulcerative colitis patients were case matched and compared with 10 previous laparoscopic-assisted (Feb 2003-Jan 2007) and 10 hand-assisted (Feb 2006-Apr 2010) total abdominal colectomies. Patient, disease and surgery-related factors were analyzed and short-term outcomes were compared. RESULTS: Given the study design, there were no differences in demographics, smoking history, disease duration and severity, nutritional and inflammatory parameters, and indication for surgery between groups. Single incision patients were more likely to have received immunosuppressive therapy within 30 days of the surgery (p = 0.016). In the single incision group we noticed significantly shorter duration of surgery (p < 0.001) and faster resumption of solid diet (p = 0.019) compared to the other groups. Other short-term outcomes did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: Single incision laparoscopy offers a safe alternative to other laparoscopic approaches. Despite the higher technical complexity, the duration of surgery is shorter with faster resumption of oral intake. Studies with larger sample size and longer follow-up will be required to confirm the benefits of this approach.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fast-track surgery accelerates recovery, reduces morbidity, and shortens hospital stay. However, the benefits of laparoscopic versus open surgery remain unproven within a fast-track program. Case reports of laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) colectomies are appearing with claims of cosmetic advantage and decreased parietal trauma. This report describes the largest case series of LESS colorectal surgery and its effects on recovery. METHODS: In this series, 20 consecutive unselected patients underwent LESS colorectal surgery including right hemicolectomy (n = 3), extended right hemicolectomy, high anterior resection (n = 2), low anterior resection involving total mesorectal excision (TME; n = 3), ileocolic anastomosis (n = 2, including 1 redo surgery), colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis (n = 4, including 1 with ventral mesh rectopexy), panproctocolectomy (n = 2), proctocolectomy and ileoanal pouch (n = 2) and an abdominoperineal excision of rectum. Single-port conventional instrumentation and transversus abdominus plane (TAP) block analgesia were used. The indications included cancer (n = 8), Crohn's disease (n = 4), ulcerative colitis (n = 3) complicated diverticulosis (n = 2), and slow-transit constipation (n = 3). Eight of the patients had undergone previous surgery. RESULTS: Most of the cases (90%) were managed successfully using the LESS technique and conventional instrumentation. Two operations (10%) were converted to standard laparoscopy, due to insufficient theater time and an unstable port. The operative time ranged from 45 to 240 min (median, 110 min). A normal diet was tolerated within 6 h by 7 patients and in 12 to 16 h (overnight) by 11 patients. Complications included anastomotic bleed (n = 1), ileus (n = 2), acute renal failure secondary to hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia (n = 1), urine retention (n = 1), and wound infection (n = 1). The median hospital stay was 46 h (range, 7-384 h). Eight patients were discharged within 24 h. There was one readmission (5%). CONCLUSION: Laparoendoscopic single-site colorectal resection using conventional instrumentation is feasible and safe when performed by an experienced team. The LESS approach may have advantages in terms of minimal pain, cosmesis, lower costs, and faster recovery. A randomized trial is required to confirm whether LESS offers a true patient benefit over standard laparoscopic resection.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Restorative proctocolectomy with ileoanal pouch is the definitive procedure in ulcerative colitis. The potential benefits afforded by a single incision laparoscopic (SILS) approach make it appropriate to consider. METHODS: Electronic data were prospectively collected from all patients who underwent SILS restorative proctocolectomy (SILS-RPC) between June 2009 and June 2010. RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients (4 male), with median BMI = 22 (range = 20-28 kg/m(2)) underwent SILS-LRPC over a 1-year period. Three had undergone a previous emergency laparoscopic colectomy. A single-port device (Covidien SILS or Olympus TriPort) was positioned at the site of the existing or proposed temporary ileostomy (2.5-cm incision). The colon and rectum were extracted through the SILS site (n = 8) or transanally following a mucosectomy (n = 2). A 20-cm J pouch was constructed extracorporeally and returned via the ileostomy site. Pouch-anal anastomosis was performed intracorporeally (n = 8) or hand-sutured (n = 2) and a diverting loop ileostomy was created at the SILS port site. The median operation time was 185 min (range = 100-381). There were no conversions or additional ports required. Median time to full diet was 36 h (range = 4-48 h) with a median hospital stay of 3 days (range = 2-8 days). There were no 30-day readmissions. Complications included surgical emphysema with temperature and a panic attack. Nine stomas have been closed. All patients have spontaneity of defecation, with a median pouch frequency of four per day, including once at night. All are fully continent and able to defer during the day. One reported a dry ejaculate for 10 weeks. CONCLUSION: SILS restorative proctocolectomy is safe with good early functional outcomes when performed by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory conditions, which are increasing in incidence, prevalence, and severity, in many countries. While there is genetic susceptibility to IBD, the probability of disease development is modified by diet, lifestyle, and endogenous factors, including the gut microbiota. For example, high intakes of mono- and disaccharides, and total fats consistently increases the risk developing both forms of IBD. High vegetable intake reduces the risk of UC, whereas increased fruit and/or dietary fiber intake appears protective against CD. Low levels of certain micronutrients, especially vitamin D, may increase the risk of both diseases. Dietary patterns may be even more important to disease susceptibility than the levels of individual foods or nutrients. Various dietary regimes may modify disease symptoms, in part through their actions on the host microbiota. Both probiotics and prebiotics may modulate the microflora, and reduce the likelihood of IBD regression. However, other dietary factors affect the microbiota in different ways. Distinguishing cause from effect, and characterizing the relative roles of human and microbial genes, diet, age of onset, gender, life style, smoking history, ethnic background, environmental exposures, and medications, will require innovative and internationally integrated approaches.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) affect bone metabolism and are frequently associated with the presence of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and increased risk of fractures. Although several mechanisms may contribute to skeletal abnormalities in IBD patients, inflammation and inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6 may be the most critical. It is not clear whether the changes in bone metabolism leading to decreased mineral density are the result of decreased bone formation, increased bone resorption, or both, with varying results reported in experimental models of IBD and in pediatric and adult IBD patients. New data, including our own, challenge the conventional views, and contributes to the unraveling of an increasingly complex network of interactions leading to the inflammation-associated bone loss. Since nutritional interventions (dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation) are of limited efficacy in IBD patients, understanding the pathophysiology of osteopenia and osteoporosis in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is critical for the correct choice of available treatments or the development of new targeted therapies. In this review, we discuss current concepts explaining the effects of inflammation, inflammatory mediators and their signaling effectors on calcium and phosphate homeostasis, osteoblast and osteoclast function, and the potential limitations of vitamin D used as an immunomodulator and anabolic hormone in IBD.},

The potential benefits of a minimal invasive approach make it appropriate to consider this approach provided that there are no adverse effects. The aim of the present study was to report our experience of laparoscopic assisted and 'total' laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy (LRPC) and to highlight the difficulties encountered and the functional results obtained. METHOD: Electronic data were prospectively collected from all patients who underwent laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy (LRPC) from October 1999 to April 2010. RESULTS: Seventy-two (40 male) patients [median body mass index 24 (19-48) kg/m(2) ] underwent LRPC over 10 years. Three had cancer. Forty-two had undergone a previous colectomy (laparoscopic in 38). There were 40 W- and 32 J-pouch reconstructions; seven were single-port procedures. The median operation time was 210 (75-330) min. There were five (7%) conversions, one of which resulted in immediate pouch failure. The median time to full diet was 36 (4-168) h, with a median hospital stay of 7 (2-64) days. There were seven (10%) readmissions. Complications were immediate (3%), early (22%) and long term (11%). The incidence of failure (excision or indefinite diversion) was 2.7%. The stoma has been closed in 67 patients. Median frequency of defaecation was 4/24 h, with normal continence in 90% and the ability to defer during the day in 98%. There was no new case of impotence or dyspareunia. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy is safe and gives good results when performed by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon.},

Manipulation of diet and the microbioma will probably play an increasingly important role in the treatment of this disease and, in the long term, in its prevention. Biological agents will probably be used earlier and more widely; new information on levels of biological agents, mucosal healing and new comparative studies will also allow these agents to be used in a more precise and personalized way. In addition to infliximab, adalimumab, natalizumab and certolizumab, other biological agents will be employed; among the first of these to be used will be ustekinumab, golimumab and vedolizumab. In the near future, biological agents will be used as frequently in ulcerative colitis as in Crohn's disease. New healthcare models will be developed that will progressively include greater participation among patients and nurses. The ability to predict new diagnostic and prognostic models will allow decisions to be more individualized.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are more likely to have Crohn's disease (CD) than ulcerative colitis (UC) and their disease tends to be more extensive and severe than in adults. We hypothesized that the prevalence of anemia would therefore be greater in children and adolescents than in adults attending IBD outpatient clinics. METHODS: Using the WHO age-adjusted definitions of anemia we assessed the prevalence, severity, type, and response to treatment of anemia in patients attending pediatric, adolescent, and adult IBD clinics at our hospital. RESULTS: The prevalence of anemia was 70% (41/59) in children, 42% (24/54) in adolescents, and 40% (49/124) in adults (P < 0.01). Overall, children (88% [36/41]) and adolescents (83% [20/24]) were more often iron-deficient than adults (55% [27/49]) (P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression showed that both active disease (odds ratio [OR], 4.7 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5, 8.8) and attending the pediatric clinic (OR 3.7; 95% CI, 1.6, 8.4) but not the adolescent clinic predicted iron deficiency anemia. Fewer iron-deficient children (13% [5/36]) than adolescents (30% [6/20]) or adults (48% [13/27]) had been given oral iron (P < 0.05); none had received intravenous iron compared with 30% (6/20) adolescents and 41% (11/27) adults (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is even more common in children than in older IBD patients. Oral iron was given to half of adolescents and adults but, despite similar tolerance and efficacy, only a quarter of children with iron-deficient anemia. Reasons for the apparent underutilization of iron therapy include a perceived lack of benefit and concerns about side effects, including worsening of IBD activity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Data concerning the anti-inflammatory effect of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are inconsistent. Salmon fillet contains n-3 PUFAs and bioactive peptides that may improve its effects compared to fish oil alone. We assessed the efficacy of a salmon-rich diet in patients with mild ulcerative colitis. METHODS: An 8-week intervention pilot study was designed to assess the effects of 600 grams Atlantic salmon consumption weekly in 12 UC patients. Simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI), a dietary questionnaire, sigmoidoscopy, selected serum inflammatory markers, fecal calprotectin, and plasma and rectal biopsy fatty acid profiles were assessed before and after intervention. RESULTS: The levels of C20:4n-6 arachidonic acid in biopsies after dietary intervention were correlated with histology and endoscopy scores. The concentrations of n-3 PUFAs, C20:5n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid, C22:6n-3 docosahexaenoic acid, and the n-3/n-6 ratio increased in plasma and rectal biopsies. The anti-inflammatory fatty acid index (AIFAI) increased both in biopsies and plasma accompanied with a significantly reduced SCCAI. CONCLUSION: Based on evidence of SCCAI and AIFAI and a tendency of decreased levels of CRP and homocysteine, intake of Atlantic salmon may have beneficial effects on disease activity in patients with mild ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of krill oil (KO) on inflammation and redox status in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: Control, DSS, and DSS + KO 5% in a 4-week diet study. Colitis was induced by 5% DSS in the drinking water the last week of the experiment. Weight and disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histological combined score (HCS), colon levels of selected cytokines and prostaglandins, markers of protein oxidative damage, fatty acid profile, and expression of selected genes were measured. RESULTS: Rats in the DSS group increased their DAI and HCS compared with healthy controls. The colon length was significantly preserved after KO diet. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta were elevated in the DSS group compared with controls. Cytokines and HCS were nonsignificantly lower in the KO versus the DSS group. Prostaglandin (PG)E(3) increased significantly in the KO versus the other groups. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma expression was nonsignificantly increased while PPAR-gamma coactivator 1alpha (Pparg1alpha) expression increased significantly after KO. The levels of protein oxidation markers decreased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: KO showed protective potential against DSS colitis based on the preservation of colon length, reduction of oxidative markers and the consistent beneficial changes of HCS, cytokine, and (PG)E(3) levels, as well as PPAR-gamma and Pparg1alpha expression compared with DSS alone. These findings indicate an anti-inflammatory and a protein antioxidant effect of KO.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are chronically relapsing, immune-mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. A major challenge in the treatment of IBD is the heterogenous nature of these pathologies. Both, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are of multifactorial etiology and feature a complex interaction of host genetic susceptibility and environmental factors such as diet and gut microbiota. Genome-wide association studies identified disease-relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms in approximately 100 genes, but at the same time twin studies also clearly indicated a strong environmental impact in disease development. However, attempts to link dietary factors to the risk of developing IBD, based on epidemiological observations showed controversial outcomes. Yet, emerging high-throughput technologies implying complete biological systems might allow taking nutrient-gene interactions into account for a better classification of patient subsets in the future. In this context, 2 new scientific fields, "nutrigenetics" and "nutrigenomics" have been established. "Nutrigenetics," studying the effect of genetic variations on nutrient-gene interactions and "Nutrigenomics," describing the impact of nutrition on physiology and health status on the level of gene transcription, protein expression, and metabolism. It is hoped that the integration of both research areas will promote the understanding of the complex gene-environment interaction in IBD etiology and in the long-term will lead to personalized nutrition for disease prevention and treatment. This review briefly summarizes data on the impact of nutrients on intestinal inflammation, highlights nutrient-gene interactions, and addresses the potential of applying "omic" technologies in the context of IBD.},

The aim of the present study was to assess a number of formerly suggested environmental factors in a case-control study of an unselected and recently diagnosed group of patients with IBD and a control group of orthopaedic patients. METHODS: A total of 123 patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) and 144 with ulcerative colitis (UC) in Copenhagen (2003-2004) were matched 1:1 on age and gender to 267 orthopaedic controls. Participants received a questionnaire with 87 questions concerning environmental factors prior to IBD/orthopaedic admission. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by logistic regression. RESULTS: Being breastfed >6 months (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.23-1.11) and undergoing tonsillectomy (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.31-0.78) decreased the odds for IBD, whereas appendectomy decreased the odds for UC only (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12-0.71). Vaccination against pertussis (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.07-4.03) and polio (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.04-5.43) increased the odds for IBD, whereas measles infection increased the odds for UC (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.15-10.6). Low consumption of fibres and high consumption of sugar were significantly associated with development of CD and UC. Smoking increased the risk for CD and protected against UC. CONCLUSION: Among Danish patients with CD and UC belonging to an unselected cohort, disease occurrence was found to be associated both with well-known factors such as smoking and appendectomy, and with more debated factors including breastfeeding, tonsillectomy, childhood vaccinations, childhood infections, and dietary intake of fibres and sugar.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Restorative proctocolectomy with ileo neo rectal anastomosis (INRA) combines cure of ulcerative colitis (UC) or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) with restoration of intestinal continuity. Evaluation of long-term results was needed to determine if there is a place for INRA in the armamentarium of a surgeon besides the ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). METHODS: All patients with INRA were included in the analysis. Patient demographics and clinical and follow-up data (morbidity, dietary problems, defecation frequency, fecal continence, anal and neorectal physiology, and neorectal mucosa assessment) were registered prospectively. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were enrolled, and in 58 patients (50 UC, 8 FAP), INRA was successful. In 21 patients, intraoperative conversion to IPAA was needed. In 49 patients with INRA, a functional reservoir was achieved. No pelvic sepsis or bladder or sexual dysfunction occurred. Thirteen patients experienced episodes of reservoir inflammation. Median bowel movements of six (5, 8) with a nocturnal defecation frequency of one were recorded with fecal continence or minor incontinence. Anal manometry and neorectal physiology showed a decrease in resting pressure and an increase in squeeze pressure and maximum tolerated volume. The median follow-up was 8.1 years (6.7, 10.1). CONCLUSIONS: This is an example of a surgical innovation with a theoretical potential to be superior to the current technique. This potential was not confirmed in short- and long-term evaluations. Hence, IPAA is currently the best available alternative to a conventional ileostomy.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: several studies have pointed out the effectiveness of the PillCam colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) compared with the colonoscopy in the study of the colonic pathology. AIMS AND METHODS: the objective of our study was to assess the agreement in the diagnosis of CCE with conventional colonoscopy as well as its sensitivity and specificity, and to describe the findings of the CCE in our clinical practice. Consecutive patients with abdominal symptoms were included in the study. The CCE was performed as previously reported (with PEG and sodium phosphate as laxative agents). The nature and location of the findings, colonic transit time, complications, cleanliness degree and consistency with diagnostic colonoscopy, when performed, were analyzed. RESULTS: a total of 144 subjects (67 women and 77 men); (52.17 +/- 16.71 years) with the following indications were included: screening of Colorectal cancer (88 patients), control after polipectomy (24), incomplete colonoscopy (7), rectal bleeding (10), anemia (8), diarrhea (7). The CCE exploration was complete in 134/144 cases (93%), with no case of retention. The preparation was good-very good in 88/134 (65,6%), fair in 26/134 (19,4%) and poor in 20/134 (15%) of the cases. The average colonic transit was of 140.76 min (9-603). Any adverse effect was notified.In 44 cases a colonoscopy was carried out after CCE (results were hidden from another endoscopist). Compared to colonoscopy, the rate of agreement was 75,6%, the sensitivity was 84% and the specificity 62,5%, PPV was 77,7% and NPV was 71,4%.The colonic findings in 134 CCE were: in 34 cases CCE it did not show lesions, diverticulosis in 63 explorations, polyps in 43, angiodysplasias in 15, Crohn's Disease in 9 and ulcerative colitis in other 8 cases. CONCLUSIONS: the CCE is an effective and reliable technique for the detection of lesions in colon, and because of its high agreement with the colonoscopy, it could be useful in clinical practice. Further studies with large seria and cost-effectiveness analysis are needed to confirm these data.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause alterations in energy requirements and invalidate the use of standard prediction equations. Our aim was to evaluate four commonly used prediction equations for resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-three children had repeated measurements of REE as part of a longitudinal research study yielding a total of 243 measurements. These were compared with predicted REE from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict equations using the Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 14.2 (2.4) years. Mean measured REE was 1566 (336) kcal per day compared with 1491 (236), 1441 (255), 1481 (232), and 1435 (212) kcal per day calculated from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict, respectively. While the Schofield equation demonstrated the least difference between measured and predicted REE, it, along with the other equations tested, did not perform uniformly across all subjects, indicating greater errors at either end of the spectrum of energy expenditure. Smaller differences were found for all prediction equations for Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly used equations, the equation of Schofield should be used in pediatric patients with IBD when measured values are not able to be obtained.},

   abstract = {Tea flavonoids belong to the large group of polyphenols and display antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic activities. These phytochemicals are xenobiotics and are synthesized by tea plants such as Camellia sinensis and Camomilla recucita. These botanicals exhibit in vivo activities similar to that of biologicals which are widely used for chronic inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, chronic inflammatory bowel disease). Epigallocathechin gallate and apigenin from these plants inhibit cytokines, chemokines and activated immune cells in vivo and in vitro. Clinical disorders with induced inflammatory pathways could benefit from flavonoid treatment. Dietary supplementation with specific tea-flavonoids could be used for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome. Suppression of cytokine production could ultimately lead to inhibition of carcinogenesis. This mechanism could explain why flavonoids are effective in the prevention of intestinal neoplasia. This innovative new form of therapy should be tested in controlled, randomized clinical studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dietary abscisic acid (ABA) has shown efficacy in ameliorating experimental IBD in mice through mechanisms requiring expression of peroxisome proliferator activated-receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) in immune cells. The goal of this study was to determine whether PPAR gamma expression in colonic epithelial cells is required for the anti-inflammatory actions of ABA. METHODS: Conditional knockout mice expressing a transgenic recombinase in intestinal epithelial cells under the control of a villin promoter (PPAR gamma flfl; Villin Cre+ or VC+) with defective expression of PPAR gamma in intestinal cells (IEC) and PPAR gamma-expressing wild type (PPAR gamma flfl; Villin Cre- or VC-) mice in a C57BL/6 background were fed diets with and without ABA (0.1 g/kg) for 35 days and challenged with 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in the drinking water for 7 days. Clinical disease severity was assessed daily and colonic lesions on day 7 through macroscopic and histopathological examination. Immune cell phenotypes were examined systemically and at the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Epithelial gene expression was assayed in the colon. RESULTS: Dietary ABA-supplementation prevented colitis, reduced disease severity, improved colonic histopathology, and upregulated epithelial lanthionine synthetase C-like protein 2 (LANCL2) expression in VC+ mice. Dietary ABA significantly increased the percentages of MLN CD4+IL-10+ T cells, and blood CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells and CD8+IL-10+ T cells. CONCLUSION: Expression of PPAR gamma in IECs was not required for the anti-inflammatory efficacy of ABA in IBD. LANCL2 in IECs and T cell-derived IL-10 may be implicated in the mechanism underlying ABA's immune modulatory activity in IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing. Dietary factors such as the spread of the "Western" diet, high in fat and protein but low in fruits and vegetables, may be associated with the increase. Although many studies have evaluated the association between diet and IBD risk, there has been no systematic review. METHODS: We performed a systematic review using guideline-recommended methodology to evaluate the association between pre-illness intake of nutrients (fats, carbohydrates, protein) and food groups (fruits, vegetables, meats) and the risk of subsequent IBD diagnosis. Eligible studies were identified via structured keyword searches in PubMed and Google Scholar and manual searches. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included, encompassing 2,609 IBD patients (1,269 Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,340 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients) and over 4,000 controls. Studies reported a positive association between high intake of saturated fats, monounsaturated fatty acids, total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), total omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, mono- and disaccharides, and meat and increased subsequent CD risk. Studies reported a negative association between dietary fiber and fruits and subsequent CD risk. High intakes of total fats, total PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were associated with an increased risk of UC. High vegetable intake was associated with a decreased risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: High dietary intakes of total fats, PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were associated with an increased risk of CD and UC. High fiber and fruit intakes were associated with decreased CD risk, and high vegetable intake was associated with decreased UC risk.},

LaBb Dahi was prepared by co-culturing Dahi bacteria (Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris NCDC-86 and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis biovar diacetylactis NCDC-60) along with selected strain of L. acidophilus LaVK2 and B. bifidum BbVK3 in buffalo milk (3% fat). Four groups of swiss albino male mice (12 each) were fed buffalo milk (3% fat), buffalo milk (3% fat) plus DSS, Dahi plus DSS, and LaBb Dahi plus DSS, respectively, for 17 days with basal diet. The myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon (IFN-gamma) were assessed as inflammatory markers, and the histopathological picture of the colon of mice was studied. DSS-induced colitis appeared to induce significant increase in MPO activity, levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IFN-gamma. Feeding with LaBb Dahi offered significant reduction in MPO activity, levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IFN-gamma when compared to either buffalo milk group or group III (Dahi). The present study suggests that LaBb probiotic Dahi can be used to combat DSS-induced biochemical and histological changes and to achieve more effective treatment for ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To identify environmental risk factors for developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children <15 years of age. METHODS: IBD patients and randomly selected healthy controls from a well defined geographical area in Denmark were prospectively recruited in the period 1.1.2007-31.12.2009. Data regarding socioeconomic status, area of residence, living conditions, infections and diet were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 118 IBD patients (59 Crohn's disease (CD), 56 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 IBD unclassified (IBDU)) and 477 healthy controls filled out the questionnaire. The response rates were 91% in patients and 45% in controls, respectively. Several risk factors for IBD were identified: IBD in first degree relatives (IBD: OR (odds ratio): 6.1 (95%CI: 2.5-15.0), CD (OR: 6.8 (2.3-20.2)) and UC (OR: 6.1 (2.3-16.0))); bedroom sharing (IBD: OR: 2.1 (1.0-4.3), CD (OR: 3.6 (1.3-9.4))); high sugar intake (IBD: OR: 2.5 (1.0-6.2), CD (OR: 2.9 (1.0-8.5))); prior admission to a hospital for gastrointestinal infections (IBD: 7.7 (3.1-19.1), CD (7.9 (2.5-24.9)) and UC (7.4 (2.5-21.6))); stressful events (IBD: 1.7 (1.0-2.9)). Protective factors were daily vs. less than daily vegetable consumption (CD: 0.3 (0.1-1.0), UC (0.3 (0.1-0.8))) and whole meal bread consumption (IBD: OR: 0.5 (0.3-0.9), CD (0.4 (0.2-0.9))). An increased risk of diagnosis of CD compared to UC was shown for patients living in more urban areas (OR: 1.3 (1.1-1.6)). CONCLUSION: We identified several risk and protective factors for developing IBD. Studies on the influence of environmental factors are important in our understanding of aetiology and phenotypes of paediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {The incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases has increased during recent decades. Within the colon, the families of mucins (MUC) and trefoil factors (TFF) facilitate mucosal protection. Probiotic administration influences the intestinal MUC layer. Additionally, food components may affect gut microflora or have direct effects on the MUC barrier. Our objective was to determine whether diet and/or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) would mediate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis by altering expression of the MUC and TFF genes. C57BL/6 mice were fed diets containing 20% (wt:wt) casein, soy, or whey proteins with or without LGG for 12 d. Seven days after starting LGG diets, the mice were given 2% DSS in drinking water for 4 d. Two additional casein groups with or without LGG were given tap water, for a total of 8 groups. One day after the DSS treatment, the mice were killed and the colon and cecum tissues and cecum contents were collected and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Whey protein significantly increased cecal LGG content compared with the other diets. In the casein diet groups, MUC1 and TFF-3 expression in colon was significantly induced by DSS independent of LGG. Compared with other DSS-treated groups, soy protein decreased MUC-1 and TFF-3 in the colon. Similarly, soy protein decreased the impact of DSS on inflammatory scores, TNFalpha gene expression, and colon shortening. There was no overall effect of LGG on these measurements. In conclusion, soy protein suppressed the DSS-induced inflammatory stimulation of MUC, TFF, and TNFalpha gene expression independently of LGG.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic recurrent disease characterized by acute inflammation of the colonic mucosa. In Japan, a dietary supplementation product enriched with glutamine, dietary fiber, and oligosaccharide (GFO) is widely applied for enteral nutrition support. These three components have been suggested to improve intestinal health. In this study, we investigated whether GFO has suppressive effects on mucosal damage in ulcerative colitis in an experimental mouse model. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice received 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water for 5 d to induce colitis. Then, they were given 0.25 mL of GFO or a 20% glucose solution twice daily for 10 d. Another set of mice receiving unaltered drinking water was used as the normal control group. RESULTS: The body weight loss and disease activity index were significantly lower in the GFO-treated mice compared with the glucose-treated mice (P < 0.05). The decrease in colon length induced by dextran sulfate sodium was significantly alleviated in GFO-treated mice compared with glucose-treated mice (P < 0.01). In addition, the histologic findings showed that intestinal inflammation was significantly attenuated in mice treated with GFO. Furthermore, treatment with GFO significantly inhibited the dextran sulfate sodium-induced increase in the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that GFO has potential therapeutic value as an adjunct therapy for ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Continent ileostomy is an alternative for patients who are either not candidates for an ileo-anal pullthrough or in whom an ileo-anal pullthrough failed. We previously described a new type of continent ileostomy (T-pouch) with a nonintussuscepting valve. OBJECTIVE: This study performed an outcomes analysis of the first 10 years with 40 patients. DESIGN: A prospective database of patients with a T-pouch from 2000 to 2010 was retrospectively analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were demographics and surgical recovery information and the functional data obtained via questionnaire: incontinence, difficulty of pouch intubation, restrictions (work, social, diet, and sexual), quality of health and life, and level of satisfaction with surgery, which were rated on a scale of 0 to 10. RESULTS: Twenty-three women and 17 men (mean age, 51.2) received a T-pouch. Median follow-up was 6.2 years (range, 0.8-11 years). Five patients (12.5%) experience a leak; 3 leaks were managed conservatively and/or with drain placement. Pouch intubations were done 4 times per day in a mean of 6.8 minutes; the insertion difficulty was rated as 2.5 of 10. Ninety-two percent achieved good continence. All quality-of-life and dysfunction/restriction scores showed significant improvement. Major abdominal surgeries for pouch-related reasons were needed in 30%; minor service operations of the skin-level stoma were needed in 25% of the patients. Of the patients, 87.5% would do the surgery again; 90% would recommend it to others with the same diagnosis. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the cohort size and the lack of long-term data. CONCLUSION: Ten years with 40 patients confirmed that creation of a T-pouch is complex but could be performed with an acceptable rate of complications. It dramatically improved functional outcomes; most notably, it improved fecal control and decreased social, sexual, and work restrictions.},

   abstract = {Carotenoid consumption has been linked to a number of beneficial health effects, including the reduction of chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular complications. However, no data are available on their action on the intestinal epithelium, being exposed to the highest concentrations of carotenoids in the human body, and where they could act preventively on intestinal inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether lycopene and beta-carotene in micelles (M), at concentrations that could be reached via the diet (10-25 mug/ml) could aid in the reduction of TNF-alpha plus IL-1beta-induced inflammation of Caco-2 human epithelial cells. The impact on biomarkers of inflammation, including IL-8, NO and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (through PGE-2alpha), and the NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways of intracellular signalling cascades were evaluated compared with controls (empty M). Furthermore, proteomic analyses were conducted from total cellular protein extracts. The results revealed that isolated carotenoids had no statistical significant anti-inflammatory effect on the biomarkers observed, or on the regulation of NF-kappaB and MAPK. Nevertheless, analyses of the proteome suggested that fifteen proteins were significantly (P < 0.05, expression ratio >1.3) differentially regulated following beta-carotene exposure, participating mostly in metabolic activities including antioxidant mechanisms, such as glutathione S-transferase A1. Only one protein was differentially regulated by lycopene (profilin-1). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate pathways involved in the action of carotenoids on the intestinal epithelium.},

   abstract = {The colon is largely being investigated as a site for administration of protein and peptides, which are degraded by digestive enzymes in the upper GIT. Also for local diseases of the colon such as inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer and ameobiasis, drug administration to the site of action can not only reduce the dose to be administered, but also decrease the side effects. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) such as Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation. Intestinal bacteria initiate the activation of intestinal inflammatory processes, which are mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine. Increased chemokine expression has also been observed in epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Future trials of specific agents capable of inhibiting chemokine synthesis and secretion or blocking chemokine-chemokine receptor interaction will be important to study in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Many important bioactive compounds have been discovered from natural sources using bioactivity directed fractionation and isolation (BDFl) Continuing discovery has also been facilitated by the recent development of new bioassay methods. These bioactive compounds are mostly plant secondary metabolites, and many naturally occurring pure compounds have become medicines, dietary supplements, and other useful commercial products. The present review includes various approaches investigated for colon drug delivery and their site specificity. To achieve successful colonic delivery, a drug needs to be protected from absorption and the environment of the upper gastrointestinal tract and then be abruptly released into the proximal colon, which is considered the optimum site for colon targeted delivery of drugs.},

METHOD: Retrospective analysis was undertaken of data accrued prospectively into a pouch database since 1983. Patients who had retained an IPAA for at least 15 years were identified. Trends in IPAA function and QOL of the patients were determined over a time-period of 15 years after formation of the IPAA. Data were compared for patients who were < 35, 35-55 and > 55 years of age when the IPAA was formed. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-six of a total of 3276 patients in the database (53% men, median age 36 years and median follow-up 17.1 years) underwent IPAA with at least 15 years of follow-up. The final pathology was ulcerative colitis in 78%; 66.4% of patients had a restorative proctocolectomy, 91.4% underwent temporary diversion, 59% had a J-pouch configuration and 63.1% a stapled anastomosis. The frequency of bowel movements remained the same over the follow-up period. There was an increase in the incidence of incontinence and urgency after 15 years with no significant change in dietary, social, work and sexual restrictions during follow-up. Patients in all three age groups experienced deterioration in pouch function at 15 years of follow up compared with the function at 5 years. The QOL of the patients remained high and stable. CONCLUSION: There is a deterioration of pouch function after 15 years, irrespective of the age of the patient when the IPAA was formed. Despite this, QOL appears to be high for all patients who retain their pouch.},

   abstract = {Dietary inclusion of a bacterial meal has recently been shown to efficiently abolish soybean meal-induced enteritis in Atlantic salmon. The objective of this study was to investigate whether inclusion of this bacterial meal in the diet could abrogate disease development in a murine model of epithelial injury and colitis and thus possibly have therapeutic potential in human inflammatory bowel disease. C57BL/6N mice were fed ad libitum a control diet or an experimental diet containing 254 g/kg of body weight BioProtein, a bacterial meal consisting of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), together with the heterogenic bacteria Ralstonia sp., Brevibacillus agri, and Aneurinibacillus sp. At day 8, colitis was induced by 3.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) ad libitum in the drinking water for 6 days. Symptoms of DSS treatment were less profound after prophylactic treatment with the diet containing the BioProtein. Colitis-associated parameters such as reduced body weight, colon shortening, and epithelial damage also showed significant improvement. Levels of acute-phase reactants, proteins whose plasma concentrations increase in response to inflammation, and neutrophil infiltration were reduced. On the other, increased epithelial cell proliferation and enhanced mucin 2 (Muc2) transcription indicated improved integrity of the colonic epithelial layer. BioProtein mainly consists of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) (88%). The results that we obtained when using a bacterial meal consisting of M. capsulatus (Bath) were similar to those obtained when using BioProtein in the DSS model. Our results show that a bacterial meal of the noncommensal bacterium M. capsulatus (Bath) has the potential to attenuate DSS-induced colitis in mice by enhancing colonic barrier function, as judged by increased epithelial proliferation and increased Muc2 transcription.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) is a prebiotic product that reduces colonic mucosal inflammation and the clinical symptoms observed in ulcerative colitis (UC). The risk of contracting colorectal cancer is higher in patients with UC than in that of the general population. The aim of this study is to apply this prebiotic approach to control chronic colitis and to reduce the incidence of colitic cancer. METHODS: Repeated and intermitted dextran sulfate sodium administration to male Sprague-Dawley rats was used for the chronic and subacute colitis models. GBF was added as the diet (10% w/v). The incidence of adenomatous high-grade dysplasia, and pathophysiological observations, including the proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labeling index, and clinical score, cecal organic acid profile, and the accompanying beta-glucosidase activity were determined. RESULTS: In the chronic phase, the incidence of adenomatous dysplasia was only confirmed in the control group, and the GBF group had no dysplasia in the entire colon; the stratified squamous epithelium area of GBF was significantly lower than that of the controls. GBF treatment significantly lowered the cecal succinate content and significantly increased beta-glucosidase activity compared to the controls. In addition, colonic mucosal inflammatory damage was comparable between the two groups, while the PCNA labeling index of the colonic mucosa in the GBF group was significantly lower than that of the control group. However, in the subacute phase, the mucosal damage score of GBF was significantly attenuated, and the PCNA labeling index of the colonic mucosa in the GBF group was significantly higher than that of the control group. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study demonstrated that GBF effectively prevents colitis-related dysplasia and inflammatory change in chronic and subacute colitis models by modulating the intestinal environment as a prebiotic. This prebiotic might contribute to the prevention of mucosal damage, to show different proliferative effects on the epithelium in the regeneration and steady states.},

METHODS: The study included 39 patients with mild to moderate UC defined as a Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) > 4 and < 12 (median: 7.5), who were treated open-label with Profermin((R)) twice daily for 24 wk. Daily SCCAI was reported observer blinded via the Internet. RESULTS: In an intention to treat (ITT) analysis, the mean reduction in SCCAI score was 56.5%. Of the 39 patients, 24 (62%) reached the primary endpoint, which was proportion of patients with >/= 50% reduction in SCCAI. Our secondary endpoint, the proportion of patients in remission defined as SCCAI </= 2.5, was in ITT analysis reached in 18 of the 39 patients (46%). In a repeated-measure regression analysis, the estimated mean reduction in score was 5.0 points (95% CI: 4.1-5.9, P < 0.001) and the estimated mean time taken to obtain half the reduction in score was 28 d (95% CI: 26-30). There were no serious adverse events (AEs) or withdrawals due to AEs. Profermin((R)) was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Profermin((R)) is safe and may be effective in inducing remission of active UC.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Anemia is one of most frequent complication of ulcerative colitis. It affects patients in the exacerbation of the disease as well as in the remission. It may be caused by the loss of the blood, the disturbances of intestinal absorption or deficient diet. The aim of the study was to estimate the rate of anemia in children with ulcerative colitis during first hospitalization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 36 children aged 2.5 to 18 years, 23 girls and 13 boys in whom ulcerative colitis was diagnosed based on the Porto criteria. Anemia in children was assessed depending on the age, period between first symptoms and diagnosis of the disease and on the activity of the disease according to PUCAI scale. RESULTS: Anemia was diagnosed in 72.2% of the children. Hemoglobin concentration ranged from 6.3 to 12.4 g/dl, average 10.05 g/dl depending on age. Activity of the disease according to PUCAI scale amounted to 5 to 80 points, average 51.9 points. Time from first symptoms to the diagnosis of the disease extended from one week to 12 months, average 3.6 months. In children without anemia the average concentration of hemoglobin was 13.2 g/dl, the activity of the disease 33.5 points and average time before diagnosis - 1.7 months. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is a frequent symptom of ulcerative colitis in children. The presence of anemia depends on the disease activity and on the time between first symptoms and diagnosis of the disease. There is a necessity of iron supplementation in children with anemia despite effective anti-inflammatory treatment.},

   abstract = {Cigarette smoke is a major risk factor for a number of diseases including lung cancer and respiratory infections. Paradoxically, it also contains nicotine, an anti-inflammatory alkaloid. There is increasing evidence that smokers have a lower incidence of some inflammatory diseases, including ulcerative colitis, and the protective effect involves the activation of a cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway that requires the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) on immune cells. Obesity is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, which contributes to insulin resistance. Nicotine significantly improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in genetically obese and diet-induced obese mice, which is associated with suppressed adipose tissue inflammation. Inflammation that results in disruption of the epithelial barrier is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease, and nicotine is protective in ulcerative colitis. This article summarizes current evidence for the anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine in obesity and ulcerative colitis. Selective agonists for the alpha7nAChR could represent a promising pharmacological strategy for the treatment of inflammation in obesity and ulcerative colitis. Nevertheless, we should keep in mind that the anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine could be mediated via the expression of several nAChRs on a particular target cell.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are inflammatory disorders caused by multiple factors. Research on IBD has often used the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. DSS induces in vivo but not in vitro intestinal inflammation. In addition, no DSS-associated molecule (free glucose, sodium sulfate solution, free dextran) induces in vitro or in vivo intestinal inflammation. We find that DSS but not dextran associated molecules established linkages with medium-chain-length fatty acids (MCFAs), such as dodecanoate, that are present in the colonic lumen. DSS complexed to MCFAs forms nanometer-sized vesicles ~200 nm in diameter that can fuse with colonocyte membranes. The arrival of nanometer-sized DSS/MCFA vesicles in the cytoplasm may activate intestinal inflammatory signaling pathways. We also show that the inflammatory activity of DSS is mediated by the dextran moieties. The deleterious effect of DSS is localized principally in the distal colon, therefore it will be important to chemically modify DSS to develop materials beneficial to the colon without affecting colon-targeting specificity.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic, progressive and disabling disorders. Over the last few decades, new therapeutic approaches have been introduced which have led not only to a reduction in the mortality rate but also offered the possibility of a favorable modification in the natural history of IBD. The identification of clinical, genetic and serological prognostic factors has permitted a better stratification of the disease, thus allowing the opportunity to indicate the most appropriate therapy. Early treatment with immunosuppressive drugs and biologics has offered the opportunity to change, at least in the short term, the course of the disease by reducing, in a subset of patients with IBD, hospitalization and the need for surgery. In this review, the crucial steps in the natural history of both UC and CD will be discussed, as well as the factors that may change their clinical course. The methodological requirements for high quality studies on the course and prognosis of IBD, the true impact of environmental and dietary factors on the clinical course of IBD, the clinical, serological and genetic predictors of the IBD course (in particular, which of these are relevant and appropriate for use in clinical practice), the impact of the various forms of medical treatment on the IBD complication rate, the role of surgery for IBD in the biologic era, the true magnitude of risk of colorectal cancer associated with IBD, as well as the mortality rate related to IBD will be stressed; all topics that are extensively discussed in separate reviews included in this issue of World Journal of Gastroenterology.},

   abstract = {Tributyrin (TBT) is a TAG composed of three butyric acids that has beneficial effects on ulcerative colitis due to its trophic, anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic and anti-carcinogenic properties. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of action of TBT supplementation in the prevention of mucosal damage in experimental colitis. Mice received either a control diet or a TBT-supplemented diet for 15 d. Colitis was induced by dextran sodium sulphate administration during the last 7 d. Mucosal damage and the activation of immune cells and cytokines were determined by histological score, flow cytometry and ELISA. Leucocyte rolling and adhesion were assessed by intravital microscopy. Oxidative stress was determined by monitoring hydroperoxide concentration and evaluating superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities. Intestinal permeability was analysed using diethylenetriaminepentaacetate acid (99mTcDTPA). Compared with the colitis group, the animals in the colitis+TBT group had reduced mucosal damage and neutrophil and eosinophil mucosal infiltration, which were associated with a higher percentage of regulatory T cells (Treg) and higher levels of transforming growth factor beta and IL-10 in the lamina propria. The level of in vivo leucocyte adhesion in the colon microvasculature was reduced after TBT supplementation. A lower level of hydroperoxide and higher levels of SOD and catalase activities were associated with TBT supplementation. TBT-supplemented mice showed reduced intestinal permeability to the levels intermediate between the control and colitis groups. In conclusion, the present results show that TBT has positive effects on colonic restructuring in experimental colitis. Additionally, TBT supplementation changes the immune response by controlling inflammation and regulating the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and Treg.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To establish a rat model of ulcerative colitis with syndrome of spleen deficiency and dampness stagnancy. METHODS: Sixty rats were divided into normal control group, ulcerative colitis group, ulcerative colitis with syndrome of spleen deficiency and dampness stagnancy group (model group) and strengthening spleen for resolving dampness group. Ulcerative colitis in rats was induced by enema containing trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) and ethanol. The rats in the model group were suffered from standing in water, limiting sleeping time and abnormal diet based on administration of TNBS and ethanol. The rats in the spleen strengthening and dampness resolving group were gastrically administered with Shenlin Baizhu Powder, a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine. Symptoms, signs and pathological changes in colon tissue of rats were observed after modeling. The levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in serum of rats were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The rats in the model group showed lethargy, poor appetite, loss of energy, diarrhea and bloody stool. Their body weight decreased significantly compared with the normal control group, and similar changes were found in the comparison of food intake, drinking amount, urine amount, stool wet weight and assay of spontaneous activity (P<0.05). When observed under a light microscope, the colon tissues of rats in the model group showed mucosal edema, congestion, inflammatory cell infiltration and ulceration. The degree of colon injury and IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha levels were significantly increased (P<0.05) as compared to those in the normal control group. The changes mentioned above were improved by Shenlin Baizhu Powder (P<0.05).

   abstract = {Nutritional assessment and dietary advice are fundamental to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient management and all patients should have access to a dietitian. Newly diagnosed patients often think that their pre-illness diet has contributed to the development of their IBD. However, epidemiological evidence to support diet as a risk factor is lacking. How the diet contributes to the gastrointestinal microbiota is interesting, although the role is not yet clearly defined. Nutritional problems in IBD are common. Malnutrition occurs in up to 85% of patients and weight loss affects up to 80% of patients with Crohn's disease and 18-62% of patients with ulcerative colitis. Nutritional deficiencies are prevalent, particularly in relation to anaemia and osteoporosis. Intestinal strictures can be problematic in Crohn's disease and limiting fibrous foods that may cause a mechanical obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract is helpful. Patients often explore dietary exclusion to alleviate symptoms but such changes may be self-directed or inappropriately advised and can lead to further nutritional deficiencies. Some patients experience concurrent functional symptoms (e.g. abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence and diarrhoea) that can significantly affect quality of life. Recently, a group of poorly absorbed carbohydrates that occur naturally in the diet called fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols have been associated with functional symptoms by intestinal bacterial fermentation leading to rapid gas production, and an osmotic effect increasing fluid delivery to the colon. Emerging evidence indicates that a diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols can alleviate functional symptoms in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The widespread use of the Internet allows for unique research opportunities. We aimed to develop and follow an Internet-based cohort (e-cohort) of patients with self-reported inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) over time. METHODS: We established an e-cohort of adults with IBD (CCFA Partners) by recruiting through Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) email rosters, CCFA Website promotion, social media, and other publicity mechanisms. The baseline survey included modules on disease course and activity, diet and exercise, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Baseline characteristics of the cohort are summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 7819 adults with IBD joined CCFA Partners through August, 2011. The median age was 42 years (interquartile range [IQR] 30-54), 5074 (72.3%) were female. A total of 4933 (63.1%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 2675 (34.2%) had ulcerative colitis (UC), and 211 (2.7%) had IBD unspecified. For CD, the mean short CD Activity Index (CDAI) was 151.9 (standard deviation [SD] 106.4), with 2274 (59.4%) in remission. For UC, the mean simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI) was 3.6 (SD 2.8), with 937 (42.9%) in remission. The mean short IBD questionnaire (SIBDQ) score was 48.7 (SD 11.8). SIBDQ was inversely correlated with disease activity (P < 0.01). The mean Morisky medication adherence score (MMAS) was 5.7 (SD 2.0). MMAS scores were inversely correlated with disease activity (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CCFA Partners is a novel e-cohort. Enrollment is ongoing, with surveys twice yearly. CCFA Partners represents a unique resource to study PROs and changes in disease management over time.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diverting loop ileostomy is used to mitigate the sequelae of anastomotic dehiscence. OBJECTIVE: To report the rate of complications after ileostomy reversal using standardized definitions to aid physicians who are deciding whether to divert anastomoses. METHODS: Patients who underwent diverting loop ileostomy closure from January 1, 2005, through February 28, 2010, were identified using a prospective database. Perioperative variables and 30-day outcomes were reviewed. Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification, in which grade III, IV, or V represents major complications. Univariate analysis assessed the relationship between operative variables and surgical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 944 patients underwent reversal: 43.1% were women, the mean age was 47.2 years, the mean body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 25.7, and 18.5% were American Society of Anesthesiologists class III or IV. Indications for the initial operation were ulcerative colitis (49.5%), rectal cancer (27.5%), diverticular disease (6.8%), and other (16.1%). Anastomotic technique for reversal was sutured fold-over in 466 patients (49.4%), stapled in 315 (33.4%), and handsewn end to end in 163 (17.3%). After reversal, the mean time to first bowel movement, tolerance of soft diet, and discharge from hospital was 2.6, 3.7, and 5.2 days, respectively. Handsewn cases had longer operative times and longer times to bowel movement, soft diet, and discharge. Overall, complications occurred in 203 patients (21.5%), including 45 patients (4.8%) who experienced a major complication; there were no deaths within 30 days. CONCLUSION: Ileostomy closure is associated with a low rate of major grade III and IV complications and should be reserved for patients who have a predicted postoperative major complication rate of 5% or more without diversion.},

METHODS: A Box-Behnken design was employed to optimize the extraction parameters, including alpha-amylase concentration (X1: 0.3 - 0.5%), enzymolysis time (X2: 30 - 60 min) and NaOH content (X3: 1.0 - 5.0%), of dietary fiber from Maixiansan using an enzyme-alkali extraction technique. RESULTS: The optimal technological conditions were as follows: alpha-amylase concentration: 0.4%; enzymolysis time: 45 min; NaOH content: 4.0%. Under these conditions, the extraction yield reached 57.14%, which was well consistent with the predicted models with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9818. An evaluation of the anti-inflammatory activity indicated that Maixiansan was able to significantly inhibit dextran sodium sulfate-induced ulcerative colitis in rats by increasing the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate and butyrate), among which the butyrate content was significantly higher in the Maixiansan group than in the other groups. CONCLUSION: Our experiments showed that response surface methodology can optimize the extraction of dietary fiber from Maixiansan. Maixiansan could be explored as an anti-ulcerative colitis agent.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a risk factor for the development of colon cancer. Environmental factors including diet and the microflora influence disease outcome. Folate and homocysteine have been associated with IBD-mediated colon cancer but their roles remain unclear. We used a model of chemically induced ulcerative colitis (dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)) with or without the colon carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) to determine the impact of dietary folic acid (FA) on colonic microflora and the development of colon tumours. Male mice (n 15 per group) were fed a FA-deficient (0 mg/kg), control (2 mg/kg) or FA-supplemented (8 mg/kg) diet for 12 weeks. Folate status was dependent on the diet (P< 0.001) and colitis-induced treatment (P= 0.04) such that mice with colitis had lower circulating folate. FA had a minimal effect on tumour initiation, growth and progression, although FA-containing diets tended to be associated with a higher tumour prevalence in DSS-treated mice (7-20 v. 0%, P= 0.08) and the development of more tumours in the distal colon of AOM-treated mice (13-83% increase, P= 0.09). Folate deficiency was associated with hyperhomocysteinaemia (P< 0.001) but homocysteine negatively correlated with tumour number (r - 0.58, P= 0.02) and load (r - 0.57, P= 0.02). FA had no effect on the intestinal microflora. The present data indicate that FA intake has no or little effect on IBD or IBD-mediated colon cancer in this model and that hyperhomocysteinaemia is a biomarker of dietary status and malabsorption rather than a cause of IBD-mediated colon cancer.},

   abstract = {Cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD) is a rapidly progressive biliary fibrosis, resembling primary sclerosing cholangitis that develops in 5-10% of patients with cystic fibrosis. Further research and evaluation of therapies are hampered by the lack of a mouse model for CFLD. Although primary sclerosing cholangitis is linked to both ulcerative colitis and loss of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel function, induction of colitis with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in cftr(-/-) mice causes bile duct injury but no fibrosis. Since profibrogenic modifier genes are linked to CFLD, we examined whether subthreshhold doses of the profibrogenic xenobiotic 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC), along with DSS-induced colitis, lead to bile duct injury and liver fibrosis in mice that harbor loss of CFTR function. Exon 10 heterozygous (cftr(+/-)) and homozygous (cftr(-/-)) mice treated with DDC demonstrated extensive mononuclear cell inflammation, bile duct proliferation, and periductular fibrosis. In contrast, wild-type (cftr(+/+)) littermates did not develop bile duct injury or fibrosis. Histological changes corresponded to increased levels of alkaline phosphatase, hydroxyproline, and expression of profibrogenic transcripts for transforming growth factor-beta(1), transforming growth factor-beta(2), procollagen alpha(1)(I), and tissue inhibitor of matrix metaloproteinase-1. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated fibrosis and activation of periductal fibrogenic cells based on positive staining for lysyl oxidase-like-2, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and collagen I. These data demonstrate that subthreshold doses of DDC, in conjunction with DSS-induced colitis, results in bile duct injury and periductal fibrosis in mice with partial or complete loss of CFTR function and may represent a useful model to study the pathogenic mechanisms by which CFTR dysfunction predisposes to fibrotic liver disease and potential therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment resistant chronic pouchitis causes significant morbidity. Elemental diet is effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Since pouchitis shares some similarities to Crohn's disease we hypothesised that elemental diet may be an effective treatment. METHOD: Seven pouchitis patients (with ulcerative colitis) were studied. All had active pouchitis with a pouch disease activity index (PDAI) >/=7. Exclusion criteria were recent NSAIDs, antibiotics or probiotics. Sufficient elemental diet to achieve energy requirements was provided. Flexible-pouchoscopy was performed, and the Cleveland Global Quality of Life score (CGQoL), Pouch Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and BMI were recorded at baseline and following 28 days of elemental diet. Faecal samples were also collected at these time points and analysed for major bacterial groups using culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Data were analysed using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. RESULTS: Following 28 days of exclusive elemental diet, median stool frequency decreased from 12 to 6 per day (p=0.028), median clinical PDAI decreased from 4 to 1 (p=0.039). There was no significant difference in quality of life scores or PDAI before and following treatment. There was a trend towards an increase in the concentration of Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale (median 7.9 to 8.5 log(1)(0)/g, p=0.08) following exclusive elemental diet. CONCLUSION: Treatment with four weeks elemental diet appeared to improve the symptoms of chronic pouchitis in some patients but is not an effective strategy for inducing remission. Although a potential symptom modifier, elemental diet cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of active pouchitis.},

   abstract = {H(2)S is an endogenous signaling molecule that may act via protein sulfhydrylation to regulate various physiological functions. H(2)S is also a byproduct of dietary sulfate metabolism by gut bacteria. Inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis are associated with an increase in the colonization of the intestine by sulfate reducing bacteria along with an increase in H(2)S production. Consistent with its increased production, H(2)S is implicated as a mediator of ulcerative colitis both in its genesis or maintenance. As T cells are well established mediators of inflammatory bowel disease, we investigated the effect of H(2)S exposure on T cell activation. Using primary mouse T lymphocytes (CD3+), OT-II CD4+ T cells, and the human Jurkat T cell line, we show that physiological levels of H(2)S potentiate TCR-induced activation. Nanomolar levels of H(2)S (50-500 nM) enhance T cell activation assessed by CD69 expression, interleukin-2 expression, and CD25 levels. Exposure of T cells to H(2)S dose-dependently enhances TCR-stimulated proliferation with a maximum at 300 nM (30% increase, p < 0.01). Furthermore, activation increases the capacity of T cells to make H(2)S via increased expression of cystathionine gamma-lyase and cystathionine beta-synthase. Disrupting this response by silencing these H(2)S producing enzymes impairs T cell activation, and proliferation and can be rescued by the addition of 300 nM H(2)S. Thus, H(2)S represents a novel autocrine immunomodulatory molecule in T cells.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colonic mucosa that can dramatically increase the risk of colon cancers. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a dietary intervention of freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB), a natural food product with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bioactivities, on disease severity in an experimental mouse model of UC using 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). C57BL/6J mice were fed either a control diet or a diet containing BRB (5 or 10%) for 7-14 days and then the extent of colonic injury was assessed. Dietary BRB markedly reduced DSS-induced acute injury to the colonic epithelium. This protection included better maintenance of body mass and reductions in colonic shortening and ulceration. BRB treatment, however, did not affect the levels of either plasma nitric oxide or colon malondialdehyde, biomarkers of oxidative stress that are otherwise increased by DSS-induced colonic injury. BRB treatment for up to 7 days suppressed tissue levels of several key pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1beta. Further examination of the inflammatory response by western blot analysis revealed that 7 day BRB treatment reduced the levels of phospho-IkappaBalpha within the colonic tissue. Colonic cyclooxygenase 2 levels were also dramatically suppressed by BRB treatment, with a concomitant decrease in the plasma prostaglandin E(2) (276 versus 34 ng/ml). These findings demonstrate a potent anti-inflammatory effect of BRB during DSS-induced colonic injury, supporting its possible therapeutic or preventive role in the pathogenesis of UC and related neoplastic events.},

Conventional treatments for UC and CD include 5-aminosalicylate, corticosteroid, elemental dietary treatment, corticosteroid, and thiopurine (azathioprine). Recently, new immunomodulators and anti-TNFa agents, such as tacrolimus, infliximab, and adalimumab have been developed and these treatments are available to be treated for patients with refractory UC and CD. Conventional step-up treatment has been replaced by top-down treatment using biologics. Infliximab and adalimumab induce not only clinical remission but also improve relapse rates and surgical rates. Endoscopic mucosal healing predicts short- and long-prognosis for both of these diseases, thus recent treatment strategy should be aimed for endoscopic remission. Although biologics is useful for patients with UC/CD, secondary loss of responses (LOR) for biologics has been partly observed in CD patients. Measuring anti-infliximab antibodies and concentration of infliximab trough level may help considering treatment strategy for patients with LOR.},

   abstract = {In vitro and animals models have long been used to study human diseases and identify novel therapeutic approaches that can be applied to combat these conditions. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two main entities of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is an intricate relationship between IBD features in human patients, in vitro and animal colitis models, mechanisms and possible therapeutic approaches in these models, and strategies that can be extrapolated and applied in humans. Malnutrition, particularly protein-energy malnutrition and vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies, as well as dysregulation of the intestinal microbiota, are common features of IBD. Based on these observations, dietary supplementation with essential nutrients known to be in short supply in the diet in IBD patients and with other molecules believed to provide beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, as well as with probiotic organisms that stimulate immune functions and resistance to infection has been tested in colitis models. Here we review current knowledge on nutritional and probiotic supplementation in in vitro and animal colitis models. While some of these strategies require further fine-tuning before they can be applied in human IBD patients, their intended purpose is to prevent, delay or treat disease symptoms in a non-pharmaceutical manner.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to identify demographic and clinical factors that are associated with CAM use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study design, patients with confirmed diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD), and >/=18 years old, attending outpatient clinics at 14 hospitals in Norway were eligible to complete questionnaires including demographics, clinical variables, and the International CAM Questionnaire (I-CAM-Q). RESULTS: Of 460 patients included in the study, 430 had evaluable questionnaires (response rate 93%). Forty-nine percent (95% CI: 44-54) had used some type of CAM within the past 12 months. CAM services were utilized by 27% (95% CI: 23-31) of the patients, 21% (95% CI: 16-23) reported use of CAM products, and 28% (95% CI: 23-31) used CAM self-help practices. The most common pattern of CAM use was to combine CAM services and CAM products. Significantly, more UC patients (56%) than CD patients (44%) reported CAM use, p = 0.03. In UC, only the presence of at least one comorbid condition was directly related to CAM use. In CD, being a woman, being aged 31-50 years, having a higher education level, and experiencing adverse drug reactions from IBD medication were factors independently associated with the use of CAM. CONCLUSION: Use of CAM was common among IBD patients attending outpatient clinics. Both demographic and clinical factors were associated to CAM use, but the factors differed in their significance for UC and CD.},

Genetic variation in the NPC1L1 gene affects cholesterol absorption and serum cholesterol levels. However, NCP1L1 genotypes have not previously been invesigated. In this study, genotyping of the NPC1L1 gene was examined in healthy individuals as well as patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A total of 541 individuals were enrolled in the study, including 80 patients with HCV hepatitis, 205 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 127 with Crohn's disease (CD). Genotyping was performed using TaqMan(R) SNP assays. Minor allelic frequencies of the 17345C>G (rs2072183) and 19031G>A (rs4720470) SNPs were found to be 0.40 and 0.30, respectively. No significant differences were detected in serum HCV levels in the 1735C>G or 19031G>A SNPs. The 1735C>G SNPs were not associated with total cholesterol (TC) levels in the healthy controls and/or HCV patients. However, statistically significant associations between the 1735GG variant and TC levels were detected in CD patients, with 1735GG carriers having the highest TC levels compared to the 1735CC and 1735CG carriers (P=0.048). Similar trends were noted in UC patients, but did not reach statistical significance (P= 0.19). The 19031G>A SNPs were not associated with TC levels in the healthy controls or patients. This study showed the allelic and genotypic distribution of 1735C>G and 19031G>ASNPs of the NPC1L1 gene in a large number of subjects. The NPC1L1 1735GG variant may therefore be favorable for CD accompanied with malnutrition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In ulcerative colitis (UC), reduction of inflammation may represent a key mechanism in UC therapy, and anti-inflammatory agents would be good candidates for preventing UC. Kaempferol, a natural flavonoid, is believed to have anti-inflammatory activities and has been shown to be potentially immune-modulatory. AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine whether kaempferol alleviates the inflammatory responses of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. METHODS: Female C57BL/6J mice were divided into six groups: a negative control group, a DSS control group, and DSS + 0.1% or 0.3% kaempferol pre- or post-fed groups. At the end of the experimental period, clinical and biochemical markers were evaluated. RESULTS: Plasma levels of NO and PGE(2) were significantly decreased in both the 0.3% kaempferol pre- and post-fed groups. The plasma LTB(4) level was profoundly decreased in all animals fed kaempferol. Colonic mucosa MPO activity was also suppressed in both the 0.3% kaempferol pre- or post-fed groups. TFF3 mRNA, a marker for goblet cell function, was up-regulated in kaempferol pre-fed animals. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that kaempferol is an effective anti-inflammatory agent that protects colonic mucosa from DSS-induced UC. Dietary kaempferol fed prior to colitis induction was more effective to suppress some of the colitis-associated markers.},

The present study evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of aloe components (aloin, aloesin and aloe-gel) known to be biologically active in the rat model of colitis. MAIN METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed experimental diets for 2 weeks before and during the induction of colitis. Drinking water containing 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) was provided for 1 week to induce colitis. At the end of the experimental period, clinical and biochemical markers were compared. KEY FINDINGS: Plasma leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations were significantly decreased in all groups supplemented with aloe components compared to the colitis control group (p<0.05). Animals fed both a 0.1% and 0.5% aloesin supplemented diet showed colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities which were decreased by 32.2% and 40.1%, respectively (p<0.05). Colonic mucosa TNF-alpha and interleukin-1ss (IL-1beta) mRNA expressions were significantly reduced in all animals fed aloin, aloesin, or aloe-gel (p<0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: Dietary supplementation of aloe components ameliorates intestinal inflammatory responses in a DSS-induced ulcerative colitis rat model. In particular, aloesin was the most potent inhibitor. Further studies are required for a more complete understanding of the specific mechanism of the action of these supplements.},

The aim of this study was to ascertain whether individuals who had an ileo-anal pouch believed themselves to have a good quality of life and a lifestyle that was not compromised as a result of surgery. The themes that emerged through the interviews were common to several participants and reflected their life, the decisions they were required to make and the resources available in order for them to do so. The outcome of this study, using a phenomenological approach, highlights that some individuals restrict their lifestyle, while others do not and are prepared to live with the consequences. The literature overwhelmingly concludes that the ileo-anal pouch procedure is a safe and efficient procedure with high patient satisfaction and good functional outcome, which should be recommended as a long-term option for ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis sufferers. However, some patients curtail their lifestyle by restricting diet, altering meal patterns and minimising social activities to maintain day-to-day living with an ileo-anal pouch.},

   abstract = {In vitro and animal studies point to numerous mechanisms by which fatty acids, especially long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), can modulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. These data strongly suggest that improving the fatty acid supply of young children in low-income countries might have immune benefits. Unfortunately, there have been virtually no studies of fatty acid/immune interactions in such settings. Clinical trial registers list over 150 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving PUFAs, only one in a low-income setting (the Gambia). We summarize those results here. There was evidence for improved growth and nutritional status, but the primary end point of chronic environmental enteropathy showed no benefit, possibly because the infants were still substantially breastfed. In high-income settings, there have been RCTs with fatty acids (usually LCPUFAs) in relation to 18 disease end points, for some of which there have been numerous trials (asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis). For these diseases, the evidence is judged reasonable for risk reduction for childhood asthma (but not in adults), as yielding possible benefit in Crohn's disease (insufficient evidence in ulcerative colitis) and for convincing evidence for rheumatoid arthritis at sufficient dose levels, though formal meta-analyses are not yet available. This analysis suggests that fatty acid interventions could yield immune benefits in children in poor settings, especially in non-breastfed children and in relation to inflammatory conditions such as persistent enteropathy. Benefits might include improved responses to enteric vaccines, which frequently perform poorly in low-income settings, and these questions merit randomized trials.},

   abstract = {The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are lower in Asia than in the West. However, across Asia the incidence and prevalence of IBD has increased rapidly over the last two to four decades. These changes may relate to increased contact with the West, westernization of diet, increasing antibiotics use, improved hygiene, vaccinations, or changes in the gut microbiota. Genetic factors also differ between Asians and the Caucasians. In Asia, UC is more prevalent than CD, although CD incidence is rapidly increasing in certain areas. There is a male predominance of CD in Asia, but a trend towards equal sex distribution for UC. IBD is diagnosed at a slightly older age than in the West, and there is rarely a second incidence peak as in the West. A positive family history is much less common than in the West, as are extra-intestinal disease manifestations. There are clear ethnic differences in incidence within countries in Asia, and an increased incidence in IBD in migrants from Asia to the West. Research in Asia, an area of rapidly changing IBD epidemiology, may lead to the discovery of critical etiologic factors that lead to the development of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which may result in nutrition problems that impact on patient health, nutritional status and quality of life. Subjective reports of how IBD patients experience these problems as part of their disease process, including comparisons between patient groups, or the need for tailored nutrition advice as perceived by these patients, have not been widely studied. This survey aimed to identify and explore nutritional problems that are important to CD and UC patients and to investigate their views on the IBD health services provided to help them with these. METHODS: Eighty-seven IBD patients were invited to take part in a nutrition survey using face-to-face questionnaire interviews. The survey asked about food and nutrition problems that patients have experienced, identifying which were most significant and the extent to which they had been addressed by the clinical service. RESULTS: Seventy-two IBD patients completed the evaluation (47 CD, 25 UC). Of these, 45 (62.5%) felt that food and nutrition were either 'important' or 'extremely important' in their experience of IBD, and 59 (82%) reported problems with food and nutrition. Patients with CD and UC reported similar frequencies of most nutritional problems. However, 44 (94%) CD vs. 16 (64%) UC patients reported problems with weight (p=0.002). Less than half of patients had seen a dietitian for tailored nutritional advice to address these problems. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional problems experienced and reported by IBD patients are numerous and varied. They are considered important by patients with CD and UC, both of whom would generally value specific dietary counselling, highlighting a need for further research in this area and adequate and equal provision of services for both groups.},

Following ileostomy closure and anastomosis, patient goals of care typically include obtaining continence and preventing complications. Nursing interventions to achieve these goals may include developing a skin care regimen, pelvic muscle floor exercises (PFME), diet changes, medication use and coping strategies. Research suggests that patient quality of life following surgery is generally good, especially in patients with a functioning pouch or a history of severe UC and a functioning pouch. However, the procedure is relatively new, and long-term (>20 years) outcomes remain largely unknown. Ongoing assessments to monitor complications such as pouchitis and pouch stricture are needed, as is research to determine the long-term effects of vaginal delivery and of living into the seventh, eighth, and ninth decades of life.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), emerged and dramatically increased for about a century. Despite extensive research, its cause remains regarded as unknown. About a decade ago, a series of findings made me suspect that saccharin may be a key causative factor for IBD, through its inhibition on gut bacteria and the resultant impaired inactivation of digestive proteases and over digestion of the mucus layer and gut barrier (the Bacteria-Protease-Mucus-Barrier hypothesis). It explained many puzzles in IBD such as its emergence and temporal changes in last century. Recently I further found evidence suggesting sucralose may be also linked to IBD through a similar mechanism as saccharin and have contributed to the recent worldwide increase of IBD. This new hypothesis suggests that UC and CD are just two symptoms of the same morbidity, rather than two different diseases. They are both caused by a weakening in gut barrier and only differ in that UC is mainly due to increased infiltration of gut bacteria and the resultant recruitment of neutrophils and formation of crypt abscess, while CD is mainly due to increased infiltration of antigens and particles from gut lumen and the resultant recruitment of macrophages and formation of granulomas. It explained the delayed appearance but accelerated increase of CD over UC and many other phenomena. This paper aims to provide a detailed description of a unified hypothesis regarding the etiology of IBD, including the cause and mechanism of IBD, as well as the relationship between UC and CD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses 2 independent but related entities: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is characterised by transmural patchy inflammation which can involve any portion of the gastrointestinal tract. UC is characterised by superficial inflammation that begins in the rectum and extends proximally along the colon. In Europe, approximately 2.2 million people have a diagnosis of IBD. The aetiology of IBD is unknown, however, immune, environmental and genetic factors are thought to be involved. Individuals with IBD are at risk of developing osteoporosis. In line with this, there are clear guidelines that recommend vitamin D supplementation for IBD patients to prevent bone disease, especially when undergoing steroid treatment. Despite an established role for vitamin D in IBD, deficiency is common. More novel effects of vitamin D beyond bone are emerging. It is now well established that vitamin D is an important regulator of the immune system which may have implications for the development, severity and management of immune related disorders such as IBD. The efficacy of vitamin D as an immune modulator in IBD remains to be proven. This review aims to evaluate the evidence implicating vitamin D deficiency in IBD pathogenesis, to examine vitamin D's anti-inflammatory mechanisms and to explore its therapeutic potential, optimal serum levels and dietary intakes which may support immune function in this disease.},

   abstract = {During the last few years a significant advance has been achieved in the understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). From twin studies it was evident that there is more that 50% concordance of Crohn's disease (CD) in monozygotic twin pairs, however it is only 3.6% among dizygotic twins. These data indicate that the genetic background may be responsible for 50% of the risk or 'susceptibility' to develop CD. Obviously it is not a sufficient condition as otherwise there would be 100% concordance of disease in monozygotic twin pairs. Environmental factors as well must play an important role. This is further supported by the fact that there is only low development in genetic risk factors over ten thousands of years. In contrast, the incidence of CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) has dramatically increased in Western countries in the last 100 years. This further supports the concept of a 'Western lifestyle factor(s)' that triggers chronic intestinal inflammation in a genetically susceptible host. The proof of the concept of a genetic susceptibility was achieved in 2001 with the discovery that NOD2 is the most important susceptibility gene for CD. The function of NOD2 has been investigated in detail. NOD2 is an intracellular 'alarm button', a receptor recognizing invading bacteria that entered the mucosal wall. NOD2 mutants associated with susceptibility to CD seem to be deficient in their recognition of bacterial wall products. In a genome-wide association study a disease association was found in the autophagy-related 16-like 1 gene (ATG16L1). The ATG16L1 gene encodes a protein in the autophagosome pathway that processes intracellular bacteria. Based on these findings, CD is now discussed as an impaired and inadequate immune reaction to the gut bacteria which are a part of our environment (or perhaps 'in-vironment'). In addition to NOD2 and ATG16L1, there are more 'innate' pathways by which commensal and pathogenic bacteria can directly interact with cells of the intestinal mucosa. The 'environment concept' and the 'genetic concept' of IBD pathophysiology are converging. With the finding that most susceptibility genes for CD and UC are involved in innate immune mechanisms and the primary defense against bacteria entering the mucosa, for the first time a unifying concept of the 'genetic pathophysiology hypothesis' and the 'environment pathophysiology hypothesis' of IBD was possible. Bacteria are the link between the environment and mucosal defense system.},

METHOD: All male and female patients undergoing IPAA at a single centre between 1983 and 2008 were compared for perioperative variables and long-term outcome. Statistical tests were used as appropriate. A multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of gender on pouch failure. RESULTS: Female patients (n=1495) were younger than male patients (n=1912) (P<0.001). Surgery type and pouch configuration were similar, although male gender was associated with a higher use of ileostomy (P<0.001) and a higher incidence of 30-day anastomotic separation (P=0.001). During a median follow up of 9.9 (female) and 9.3 (male) years, female patients were more likely to develop bowel obstruction (20.8 vs 16.7%, P=0.02) and pouch-related fistula (10.9 vs 7.6%, P=0.001). Women had a higher number of daily bowel movements than men (P=0.001), and more frequently had urgency (P=0.001), daily seepage (P=0.01) and pad use (P<0.001). A higher percentage of female patients reported dietary (P<0.001) and work (P=0.022) restrictions and lower mental component of the Short-Form 36 quality of life score (P=0.018). On multivariate analysis of perioperative variables, female gender was associated with pouch failure (P=0.05). CONCLUSION: The gender of the patient seems to be associated with specific differences in preoperative variables and postoperative outcomes for patients undergoing IPAA.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic inflammatory disorders that can affect the gastrointestinal tract of children and adults. Like other autoimmune processes, the cause(s) of these disorders remain unknown but likely involves some interplay between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. Children, in particular with UC or CD, can present to their primary care providers with similar symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloody stool. Although UC and CD are more predominant in adults, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that a significant percentage of these patients were diagnosed during childhood. The chronic nature of the inflammatory process observed in these children and the waxing and waning nature of their clinical symptoms can be especially disruptive to their physical, social, and academic development. As such, physicians caring for children must consider these diseases when evaluating patients with compatible symptoms. Recent research efforts have made available a variety of more specific and effective pharmacologic agents and improved endoscopic and radiologic assessment tools to assist clinicians in the diagnosis and interval assessment of their patients with IBD; however, as the level of complexity of these interventions has increased, so too has the need for practitioners to become familiar with a wider array of treatments and the risks and benefits of particular diagnostic testing. Nonetheless, in most cases, and especially when frequent visits to subspecialty referral centers are not geographically feasible, primary care providers can be active participants in the management of their pediatric patients with IBD. The goal of this article is to educate and assist pediatricians and adult gastroenterology physicians caring for children with IBD, and in doing so, help to develop more collaborative care plans between primary care and subspecialty providers.},

Biopsy samples from subjects with adenomas had greater numbers of bacteria from 87 taxa than controls; only 5 taxa were more abundant in control samples. The magnitude of the differences in the distal gut microbiota between patients with adenomas and controls was more pronounced than that of any other clinical parameters including obesity, diet or family history of CRC. This suggests that sequence analysis of the microbiota could be used to identify patients at risk for developing adenomas.},

   abstract = {Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has demonstrated immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory properties in murine experimental ulcerative colitis (UC). In addition to its high monounsaturated fatty acid content, evidences have accumulated on the favorable properties of minor, although highly bioactive, components present in the unsaponifiable fraction (UF). The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of dietary EVOO's UF supplementation on acute UC. C57BL/6 mice were fed from weaning with sunflower oil (SD), EVOO diet and UF-enriched SD at 5% oil (SD+UF). After 30 days, mice were exposed to 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 5 days developing acute colitis. After 4 days of DSS removal, animals were sacrificed and colons were histological and biochemically processed. Disease activity index and microscopic damage score were significantly improved in EVOO and SD+UF dietary groups versus SD group. In addition, both dietary treatments significantly induced decreases in MCP-1 and TNF-alpha levels, iNOS and COX-2 overexpression and p38 MAPKs activation in colon mucosa. Moreover, an upregulation of IkappaB expression was also observed after feeding the animals with both diets. However, no statistically differences between data from mice fed with EVOO or UF+SD diets were observed. Dietary enrichment with EVOO's UF reduces the damage in acute colitis model, alleviating the oxidative events and returning proinflammatory proteins expression to basal levels probably through p38 MAPK and NFkappaB signalling pathways. EVOO's UF diet might provide a basis for developing a new strategy in dietary supplementation for the prevention of UC.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Recent epidemiological studies have shown that habitual consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), the characteristic culinary fat of the Mediterranean area, is effective in the prevention of diverse types of digestive disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. Many of these benefits are, in addition to its high proportion of oleic acid, due to the high content of phenolic compounds. METHODS: Six-week-old mice were randomized into three dietary groups: standard, EVOO and hydroxytyrosol-enriched EVOO. After 30 days, mice that were exposed to 3% DSS for 5 days developed acute colitis that progressed to severe chronic inflammation during a regime of 21 days of water. RESULTS: Diets enriched with EVOO significantly attenuated the clinical and histological signs of damage, improving results from disease activity index and reducing about 50% the mortality caused by DSS. Moreover, hydroxytyrosol supplement showed better results. Cytokines study showed that TNF-alpha was maintained near to sham control and IL-10 levels were significantly improved in EVOO and EVOO plus hydroxytyrosol diet-DSS groups. In the same way, COX-2 and iNOS were downregulated, and the activation of p38 MAPK was reduced. We also observed a higher significant reduction in iNOS in hydroxytyrosol-enriched EVOO compared with EVOO alone. CONCLUSIONS: EVOO diets exerted a noteworthy beneficial effect in chronic DSS-induced colitis by cytokine modulation and COX-2 and iNOS reduction via downregulation of p38 MAPK. In addition to the beneficial effect by EVOO, supplementation of the diet with hydroxytyrosol may improve chronic colitis through iNOS downregulation plus its antioxidant capacity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in human health through the modulation of innate immune responses. While selected commensal bacteria are marketed in specific probiotic products to control these responses, relatively little is known about the immune modulation potential of dairy bacteria that have principally been selected for their fermentation properties. The modulation of innate immune responses may reduce chronic inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis. METHODS: A collection of dairy Lactobacillus delbrueckii strains was screened for immune modulation effects in vitro through the quantification of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation in a human intestinal epithelial cell line. Selected bacterial strains were then tested in vivo in a mouse dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis model. RESULTS: All L. delbrueckii strains tested showed anti-inflammatory effects in vitro, to an extent that varied between strains. These effects rely on bacterial surface exposed proteins and affect the central part of the NF-kappaB activation pathway. One of the selected strains significantly reduced the macroscopic and microscopic symptoms of DSS-induced colitis in the mouse intestinal tract, diminished body weight loss, and improved survival. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that dairy lactobacilli that often are part of a regular diet can modulate innate immune responses, and may thus affect health more than generally thought. One of the strains tested alleviated the symptoms of DSS-induced colitis in mice, a model of human ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Many foods have been implicated in theories about the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. While evidence has accumulated that nutritional factors as part of overall lifestyle changes may play a role in the growing incidence, no specific dietary recommendations except the promotion of breastfeeding can currently be given to decrease the risk of developing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. For the treatment of Crohn's disease in children and adolescents, however, enteral feeding with a semi-elemental diet seems to be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing and maintaining remission. In the meta-analyses, advantages of one formula over the other are evened out, and more research is warranted into the anti-inflammatory properties of different nutrients, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, butyrate, glutamine, and cytokines, such as transforming growth factors-beta. Unfortunately, for practical reasons, nutritional therapy remains underutilized, even though pediatric patients are most vulnerable to the harmful effects of nutrient deficiencies on growth, pubertal development, and bone health. There is hope that in the future the new field of nutrigenomics may enable physicians to more accurately tailor a specific diet to the patient genotype.},

Food nutrients were believed to play a certain role in the causation of the disease, in conjunction with genetic, immunologic, environmental and other factors (especially intestinal microbiota). Various nutrients were found to be involved, sometimes with controversial results, possibly pertaining to geographic regions. Nutrition has to be especially considered in children as disease itself and/or the medication can severely impair normal growth and development, sometimes with permanent long-term sequels. We reviewed the data on the possible roles of diet in preventing the disease and relapses. We emphasize the crucial importance of enteral nutrition in inducing and maintaining the remission of Crohn's disease, according to the existing consensuses (benefits, indications, routes of administration, types of formula, duration, results). We also present data on parenteral nutrition in pediatric IBD, with current updates from literature.},

The nature of these inputs is complex, with each having distinct and overlapping contributions to ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Identification of specific genetic risk factors has improved the understanding of specific pathways to disease, but the primacy of environmental or lifestyle factors linked to changes in the gut microbiota, particularly in early life, is increasingly evident. Clarification of the molecular basis of host-microbe interactions in health and in susceptible individuals promises novel therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at high risk for low bone mineral density (BMD). This study aimed to evaluate BMD in IBD patients and its relationship with bone metabolism in a group of Iranian patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with IBD to assess BMD status and serum biochemical factors. After getting the demographic data from 200 patients, they were screened using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry of the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and femoral neck for BMD status. Serum levels of calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH vitamin D) were measured to assess the bone metabolism status. RESULTS: Two hundred patients with IBD were enrolled in the study. One hundred and eighty three (91.5%) patients were identified as having ulcerative colitis (UC) and 17 (8.5%) as having Crohn's disease (CD). Based on the lumbar and femoral neck bone mass densitometry, 148 (74.4%) patients had low BMD at either lumbar spine or femoral neck. Of these, 100 patients (50.3%) were osteopenic and 48 patients (24.1%) were osteoporotic. A 58.6% and 61% of patients with UC had low BMD in the lumbar and femoral neck, respectively. These results for those with CD were 76.5% and 70.6%, respectively. The mean of femoral neck and lumbar T-scores in patients with UC were -1.14 and -1.38, and in patients with CD were -1.24 and -1.47, respectively (P > 0.05). The mean (+/-SD) levels for calcium (Ca) in UC and CD were in the normal range. The mean (+/-SD) levels of ALP and 25-OH vitamin D in both the groups were in the normal range, and in comparison between groups (UC and CD), no significant differences were observed (P = 0.20 for ALP and P = 0.44 for 25-OH vitamin D). In the assessment of correlation between biochemical markers and BMD, an inverse correlation between lumbar T-score and ALP or 25-OH vitamin D only in patients with UC was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of low BMD in the Iranian population with IBD needs attention. The subclinical vitamin D deficiency may contribute to bone loss in IBD patients, which is more pronounced in patients with UC in this study because of the small population of patients with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It remains to be shown whether inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of primary intestinal lymphoproliferative disorders (PILD). We assessed this risk in the CESAME French nationwide prospective observational cohort. METHODS: In all, 680 gastroenterologists enrolled 19,486 patients with IBD (Crohn's disease in 60.3%) from May 2004 to June 2005. Follow-up ended on 31 December 2007. Available biopsy samples and surgical specimens from patients with PILD (n = 14) were centralized for review. The reference incidence of PILD in the general population was obtained from the Cote d'Or registry and was used as a comparator to assess the standardized incidence ratio (SIR). The influence of thiopurine exposure was explored in a nested case-control study. RESULTS: In the CESAME population the crude incidence of PILD was 0.12/1000 patient-years, with a corresponding SIR of 17.51 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.43-38.11; P < 0.0001). The risk was highest in patients exposed to thiopurines (SIR 49.52, 95% CI 13.49-126.8; P < 0.0001), while it did not reach statistical significance in patients naive to thiopurines (SIR 4.83, 95% CI, 0.12-26.91; P = 0.37). The odds ratio associated with ongoing thiopurine exposure (vs. naive) was 2.97 (95% CI, 0.30-infinity; P = 0.38). All 14 cases of PILD were non-Hodgkin's B-cell LD, 78.6% occurred in males, 85.7% arose in IBD lesions, and 45.5% were Epstein-Barr virus-positive. Eleven cases occurred in patients with Crohn's disease. Mean (SD) age at PILD diagnosis was 55.1 (5.6) years and the median time since IBD onset was 8.0 years (interquartile range, 3.0-15.8). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD have an increased risk of developing PILD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Environmental factors may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD. The history of patients of the German IBD twin study was analyzed by questionnaires and interviews. METHODS: Randomly selected German monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins with at least one sibling suffering from IBD (n=512) were characterized in detail including demography, medical history and concomitant medications. Controls comprised of non-twin IBD patients (n=392) and healthy subjects (n=207). RESULTS: The most significant variables that were associated with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) included living abroad before time of diagnosis (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 1.57-13.69), high frequency of antibiotic use (MZ CD OR, 5.03; 95% CI 1.61-17.74, DZ CD OR, 7.66; 95% CI, 3.63-16.82, MZ UC OR, 3.82; 95% CI, 1.45-10.56, DZ UC OR, 3.08; CI, 1.63-5.92), high consumption of processed meat including sausage (MZ CD OR, 7.9; 95% CI, 2.15-38.12, DZ CD OR, 10.75; 95% CI, 4.82-25.55, MZ UC OR, 5.69; 95% CI, 1.89-19.48, DZ UC OR, 18.11; 95% CI, 7.34-50.85), and recall of bacterial gastrointestinal infections (MZ CD OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.33-77.14, DZ CD OR, 17.21; 95% CI, 4.47-112.5, MZ UC OR, 5.87; 95% CI, 1.61-28.0, DZ UC OR, 11.34; 95% CI, 4.81-29.67). CONCLUSIONS: This study reinforced the association of life style events, in particular a specific dietary and infections history, with IBD. Alteration of gut flora or alterations of the mucosal immune system in reactivity to the flora could be an important factor to explain the relationship between life-style and disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) mediate pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation. We characterized the role of the gelatinase (GelE), a metalloprotease from Enterococcus faecalis, in the development of colitis in mice. METHODS: Germ-free, interleukin-10-deficient (IL-10(-/-)) mice were monoassociated with the colitogenic E faecalis strain OG1RF and isogenic, GelE-mutant strains. Barrier function was determined by measuring E-cadherin expression, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), and translocation of permeability markers in colonic epithelial cells and colon segments from IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice. GelE specificity was shown with the MMP inhibitor marimastat. RESULTS: Histologic analysis (score 0-4) of E faecalis monoassociated IL-10(-/-) mice revealed a significant reduction in colonic tissue inflammation in the absence of bacteria-derived GelE. We identified cleavage sites for GelE in the sequence of recombinant mouse E-cadherin, indicating that it might be degraded by GelE. Experiments with Ussing chambers and purified GelE revealed the loss of barrier function and extracellular E-cadherin in mice susceptible to intestinal inflammation (IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice) before inflammation developed. Colonic epithelial cells had reduced TER and increased translocation of permeability markers after stimulation with GelE from OG1RF or strains of E faecalis isolated from patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: The metalloprotease GelE, produced by commensal strains of E faecalis, contributes to development of chronic intestinal inflammation in mice that are susceptible to intestinal inflammation (IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice) by impairing epithelial barrier integrity.},

   abstract = {Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis is an experimental model of ulcerative colitis, although the precise mechanism has not yet been elucidated. We investigate whether Zn deficiency affects the pathogenesis of colitis induced by DSS with a focus on immune responses. Male WKAH/Hkm Slc rats were fed either a Zn-adequate (ZA, 30 mg Zn/kg diet) as a control or Zndeficient (ZD, 5 mg Zn/kg diet) diet for 21 days and then treated with 2% DSS via deionized drinking water for 7 days. The disease activity index (DAI) was recorded daily throughout DSS treatment. Serum Zn concentrations were significantly lowered in rats fed the ZD diet than those fed the ZA diet at day 7 and 14. Surprisingly, DSS treatment considerably reduced the serum Zn in both groups. The rats fed the ZD diet showed exacerbated colitis based on clinical outcomes, including weight loss, increased DAI, and shortened colon length. An in vitro study corroborated these results, showing that a large amount of TNFalpha was induced by rat mesenteric leukocytes in response to lipopolysaccharide in ZD medium, but not in ZA medium. These results indicate that a modulation of TNFalpha production due to Zn deficiency influences disease activity in DSS-induced colitis. In addition, more attention should be given to Zn for prevention of colitis.},

An extract of the herb, HMPL-004, inhibits TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, and prevents colitis in animal models. AIM: To determine the efficacy and safety of HMPL-004 in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, multicentre, 8-week parallel group study was conducted using HMPL-004 1200 mg/day compared with 4500 mg/day of slow release mesalazine (mesalamine) granules in patients with mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis. Disease activity was assessed at baseline and every 2 weeks for clinical response, and at baseline and 8 weeks by colonoscopy. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients at five centres in China were randomised and dosed. Clinical remission and response were seen in 21% and 76% of HMPL-004-treated patients, and 16% and 82% of mesalazine-treated patients. By colonoscopy, remission and response were seen in 28% and 74% of HMPL-004-treated patients and 24% and 71% of mesalazine-treated patients, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: HMPL-004 may be an efficacious alternative to mesalazine in ulcerative colitis.},

METHODS: Mice with chronic ulcerative colitis induced by 2 cycles of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in the first and fourth week of the experiment were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity by 8 weeks. The animals were divided into 4 \ groups (control, colitis, HFD and colitis + HFD). RESULTS: Obesity alone did not raise histopathology scores, but the combination of obesity and colitis worsened the scores in the colon compared to colitis group. Despite the reduction in weight gain, there was increased inflammatory infiltrate in both the colon and visceral adipose tissue of colitis + HFD mice due to increased infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes. Intravital microscopy of VAT microvasculature showed an increase in leukocyte adhesion and rolling and overexpression of adhesion molecules compared to other groups. Moreover, circulating lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils in the spleen and cecal lymph nodes were increased in the colitis + HFD group. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated the relationship between ulcerative colitis and obesity as aggravating factors for each disease, with increased inflammation in the colon and adipose tissue and systemic alterations observed in the spleen, lymph nodes and bloodstream.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to longitudinally study serum homocysteine levels in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in relation to disease activity and B vitamin status. METHODS: In all, 98 consecutive adult patients (age 25-55 years) with CD (n = 70) and UC (n = 28) were enrolled and assessed at three timepoints over 1 year. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in levels of homocysteine, B vitamins, or dietary intake by disease type, disease activity, or across visits. 13% of all inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients had elevated homocysteine at least once during the study. Nine patients with CD had fluctuating homocysteine levels during the study but these were inconsistent, ranging from within normal range to elevated levels in any individual. Six of these nine patients were persistently in remission. 30% of all IBD patients had vitamin B6 deficiency, 11% had vitamin B12 deficiency, and one patient (CD) had folate deficiency. All vitamins showed a significant correlation between intake and serum levels (B6; r = 0.46, P < 0.001, B12; r = 0.42, P < 0.001, and folate; r = 0.26, P = 0.008). There was an inverse relationship between serum homocysteine in the blood and serum vitamin B12 (r = -0.241, P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Serum homocysteine was mostly normal in patients with IBD and changed minimally over time. There was no association between disease activity and elevation of serum homocysteine. 30% of patients have vitamin B6 deficiency but vitamin B6 is not associated with elevated homocysteine. The routine measurement of homocysteine is not warranted.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and can be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis. Dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) colitis in rats appears to mimic nearly all of the morphological characteristics and lesion distributions of ulcerative colitis. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the efficacy of omega 3 fatty acids in the treatment of experimental ulcerative colitis. METHODS: thirty-six Wistar rats were randomly assigned to group A or group B receiving 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in their drinking water for eight days. For the next eight days post-DSS, group A animals received tap-water, and group B animals were fed a nutritional solution containing high levels of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ProSure(R), Abbott Laboratories, Zwolle, Netherlands) once per day, administrated with a orogastric feeding tube. RESULTS: animals fed an omega 3 rich diet exhibited a statistically significant increase in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, compared to animals drinking tap water, and a trend towards histopathological and clinical improvement, with the administration of omega 3 fatty acids ameliorating epithelial erosion by day 8 post-DSS, but no statistically significant difference was observed between group A and group B animals at 4 or 8 days post-DSS. Also, a statistically significant increase in neutrophil infiltration was observed, as depicted by myelohyperoxidase activity. CONCLUSION: our findings support a positive role of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation in an experimental model of ulcerative colitis despite the increased colonic neutrophil infiltration. Further studies are needed in order to investigate the role of increased neutrophils in colonic mucosa.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: High-fat diets have been shown to be a risk factor for ulcerative colitis (UC). Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are considered to increase lipid peroxidation, while the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid exerts a chemopreventative effect. We evaluated the effect of high-fat diets (20%) enriched with fish or soybean oil on colonic inflammation and DNA damage in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (28-30 days) were fed an American Institute of Nutrition (AIN)-93 diet for 47 days and divided into five groups: control normal fat non-colitic (C) or control colitis (CC), high soybean fat group (HS) colitis, high fish fat group colitis, or high-fat soybean plus fish oil colitis. UC was induced from day 35 until day 41 by 3% dextran sulfate sodium. On day 47, the rats were anesthetized; blood samples collected for corticosterone determination, and the distal colon was excised to quantify interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-10, and interferon-gamma levels, myeloperoxidase activity, histological analyses, and DNA damage. The disease activity index was recorded daily. RESULTS: The disease activity index, histological analysis, myeloperoxidase activity, IL-4, interferon-gamma, and corticosterone levels did not differ among the colitic groups. IL-10 was significantly increased by the high fish fat group diet in relation to HS, but only the high soybean-fish fat diet increased the IL-10/IL-4 ratio (anti-inflammatory/pro-inflammatory) to levels closer to the C group and reduced DNA damage compared to the HS group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The data show that high-fat diets did not exacerbate UC and suggest that the soybean and fish oil mixture, more than the fish oil alone, could be a complementary therapy to achieve a cytokine balance in UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective method of treatment in achieving remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. The objective of our study was to assess the influence of EEN on serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) in children and adolescents with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine children and adolescents with IBD (24 with Crohn disease [CD] and 15 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 25 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. VEGF and TGF-beta1 were assessed at the baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of EEN in CD and UC groups and once in controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immunoassays. RESULTS: At the baseline, we found increased serum VEGF in the CD versus UC group and controls (P < 0.05) and serum TGF-beta1 in the UC versus CD group and controls (P < 0.05). During EEN, VEGF decreased in the UC and CD groups, whereas TGF-beta1 increased in the CD group and decreased in the UC group. The CD group achieved disease remission faster than the UC group, and the weight gain of patients with CD during EEN was higher compared with patients with UC. Additionally, TGF-beta1 concentration correlated with protein and energies daily intake in the CD group (R = 0.95; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different effectiveness of EEN in achieving remission in CD and UC may result from a modification of growth factor production. EEN stimulated TGF-beta1 production in CD but not in UC, which possibly resulted in higher effectiveness of EEN in this group of patients.},

This study was undertaken to determine the clinical presentation and whether a western style diet or infection with geo-helminths were associated with the condition. METHODS: Three questionnaires were given to the patients: one relating to diet, one relating to clinical presentation and one relating to quality of life. The disease was confirmed endoscopically and histologically. Faeces were examined for parasites. RESULTS: Forty four patients were enrolled (43-ulcerative colitis; 1-Crohn's Disease). All but one had ulcerative colitis. Most had no family history of disease. The peak age of onset was 21-40 y and 63% gave a history of more than 6 months symptoms prior to diagnosis. Clinical presentation was similar to cases in western countries although milder with less severe life-events. None of them had undergone surgery. All patients ate a rice-based diet and none ate bread made of refined flour. Only 2 patient was infected with a geo-helminth. CONCLUSIONS: Eating bread made of refined flour is not related to development of IBD in these patients. The prevalence of geo-helminths in the study population corresponded to the general population average. Delay in diagnosis occurs because of an initial assumption that the cause of symptoms is infective. A National Register of non-infectious gastrointestinal disease would aid the epidemiology and allocation of funding to this inflammatory condition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Physical activity is important for muscle and bone strength in the growing child and may be impaired in paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) even during quiescent disease. The SenseWearPro(2) armband allows to measure physical activity under everyday life conditions. METHODS: Thirty-nine IBD patients (27 Crohn's disease, 12 ulcerative colitis, 24 boys) in remission (n=26) or with only mild disease activity (n=13) were compared to 39 healthy age and sex-matched controls. Body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), lean body mass as phase angle alpha (determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis), and dynamometric grip force were expressed as age- and sex-related Z-scores. SenseWearPro(2) armbands were applied for three consecutive days to record number of steps, duration of physical activity and sleeping time. Quality of life was assessed with the German KINDL and IMPACT III questionnaires, energy intake with prospective food protocols. Differences between patients and pair-matched controls were analysed by paired t-test. RESULTS: Patients showed lower Z-scores for phase angle alpha (difference -0.72; 95% CI [-1.10; -0.34]) and lower grip strength (-1.02 [-1.58; -0.47]) than controls. They tended towards lesser number of steps per day (-1339 [-2760; 83]) and shorter duration of physical activity (-0.44 h [-0.94; 0.06]), particularly in females and patients with mild disease. Quality of life and energy intake did not differ between patients and controls. CONCLUSION: In spite of quiescent disease lean body mass and physical activity were reduced. Interventions to encourage physical activity may be beneficial in this lifelong disease.},

   abstract = {It is generally accepted that carbohydrate fermentation results in beneficial effects for the host because of the generation of short chain fatty acids, whereas protein fermentation is considered detrimental for the host's health. Protein fermentation mainly occurs in the distal colon, when carbohydrates get depleted and results in the production of potentially toxic metabolites such as ammonia, amines, phenols and sulfides. However, the effectivity of these metabolites has been established mainly in in vitro studies. In addition, some important bowel diseases such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and ulcerative colitis appear most often in the distal colon, which is the primary site of protein fermentation. Finally, epidemiological studies revealed that diets rich in meat are associated with the prevalence of CRC, as is the case in Western society. Importantly, meat intake not only increases fermentation of proteins but also induces increased intake of fat, heme and heterocyclic amines, which may also play a role in the development of CRC. Despite these indications, the relationship between gut health and protein fermentation has not been thoroughly investigated. In this review, the existing evidence about the potential toxicity of protein fermentation from in vitro animal and human studies will be summarized.},

Anaemia was defined using WHO standards and iron deficiency defined using published guidelines. RESULTS: 46 children (16 girls) with Crohn's disease and 34 children (18 girls) with UC were studied. 75% of children with IBD were anaemic at diagnosis, 30% were anaemic at follow up two years later. 90% of children with Crohn's and 95% of children with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) were iron deficient at diagnosis. At follow up two years later 70% of children with Crohn's and 65% of children with UC were iron deficient. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent anaemia and iron deficiency are common in childhood IBD, prevalence alters with duration of time from diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in the use of nutrition risk assessment tools in paediatrics to identify those who need nutrition support. Four non-disease specific screening tools have been developed, although there is a paucity of data on their application in clinical practice and the degree of inter-tool agreement. METHODS: The concurrent validity of four nutrition screening tools [Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Paediatrics (STAMP), Screening Tool for Risk On Nutritional status and Growth (STRONGkids), Paediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score (PYMS) and Simple Paediatric Nutrition Risk Score (PNRS)] was examined in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease. Degree of malnutrition was determined by anthropometry alone using World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria. RESULTS: There was good agreement between STAMP, STRONGkids and PNRS (kappa > 0.6) but there was only modest agreement between PYMS and the other scores (kappa = 0.3). No children scored low risk with STAMP, STRONGkids or PNRS; however, 23 children scored low risk with PYMS. There was no agreement between the risk tools and the degree of malnutrition based on anthropometric data (kappa < 0.1). Three children had anthropometry consistent with malnutrition and these were all scored high risk. Four children had body mass index SD scores < -2, one of which was scored at low nutrition risk. CONCLUSIONS: The relevance of nutrition screening tools for children with chronic disease is unclear. In addition, there is the potential to under recognise nutritional impairment (and therefore nutritional risk) in children with inflammatory bowel disease.},

Significant deficits in height and weight in children with Crohn's disease have been reported but changes in fat and fat free mass are less well defined. This study aims to describe the height, weight and body composition of a cohort of children with IBD. METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. Disease activity was assessed with clinical scoring systems. RESULTS: 55 children, median age 13.7 years (range 6.5-17.7) were studied. Median (25th, 75th percentile) Standard Deviation Score for BMI, Height and Weight were - 0.3 (- 0.97, 0.65), - 0.56 (- 1.42, 0.06), - 0.62 (- 1.43, 0.19). In Crohn's disease, using multiple regression analysis disease activity measured by PCDAI was significantly inversely related to fat free mass (beta - 0.2, 95% CI -0.17, -0.03, p 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBD were both under and overweight. Nutritional deficits were more common in Crohn's disease. Fat free mass was related to disease activity in children with Crohn's disease regardless of changes in weight. Weight or BMI may mask deficits in lean tissue in the presence of normal or increased proportions of body fat.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Guaiac tests are the most widely used tests to detect colorectal cancer (CRC). However, their sensitivity is relatively low and results may be affected by various factors. Immunofecal occult blood test (IFOBT) is specific for human hemoglobin and does not require dietary restrictions. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of IFOBT for the screening of precancerous lesions and CRC. METHODS: From July 2006 to June 2007, IFOBT was performed on 5,919 adults who received periodic health examinations in our hospital. The positive cases were examined by colonoscopy and a double-contrast barium enema. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological analysis. RESULTS: Positive IFOBT was detected in 314 of 5,919 cases (5.30%). Further examinations were made in 264 IFOBT-positive cases. Of these, 116 cases with colorectal cancer (16 cases) or precancerous lesions (94 cases with colorectal adenomatous polyps and 6 cases with active ulcerative colitis) were detected. The total detection rate of CRC and precancerous lesions was 43.94% (116/264). TNM classification of 16 CRC cases was as follows: TNM I in eight cases (50.00%), TNM II in seven cases (43.75%) and TNM III in one case (6.25%), indicating IFOBT can detect CRC in the early stages. CONCLUSION: Regular IFOBT can detect precancerous lesions and CRC in early stages and can thus reduce mortality from CRC.},

   abstract = {Epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) contribute to colonic tumorigenesis in experimental models of colon cancer. We previously showed that EGFR was also required for colonic tumor promotion by Western diet. The goal of this study was to identify EGFR-regulated microRNAs that contribute to diet-promoted colonic tumorigenesis. Murine colonic tumors from Egfr(wt) and hypomorphic Egfr(wa2) mice were screened using micro RNA (miRNA) arrays and miR-143 and miR-145 changes confirmed by Northern, real-time PCR, and in situ analysis. Rodent and human sporadic and ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated colon cancers were examined for miR-143 and miR-145. Effects of EGFR on miR-143 and miR-145 expression were assessed in murine and human colonic cells and their putative targets examined in vitro and in vivo. miR-143 and miR-145 were readily detected in normal colonocytes and comparable in Egfr(wt) and Egfr(wa2) mice. These miRNAs were downregulated in azoxymethane and inflammation-associated colonic tumors from Egfr(wt) mice but upregulated in Egfr(wa2) tumors. They were also reduced in human sporadic and UC colon cancers. EGFR signals suppressed miR-143 and miR-145 in human and murine colonic cells. Transfected miR-143 and miR-145 inhibited HCT116 cell growth in vitro and in vivo and downregulated G(1) regulators, K-Ras, MYC, CCND2, cdk6, and E2F3, putative or established targets of these miRNAs. miRNA targets Ras and MYC were increased in colonic tumors from Egfr(wt) but not Egfr(wa2) mice fed a Western diet. EGFR suppresses miR-143 and miR-145 in murine models of colon cancer. Furthermore, Western diet unmasks the tumor suppressor roles of these EGFR-regulated miRNAs.},

   abstract = {The human gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex and abundant microbial community reaching as high as 10(13)-10(14) microorganisms in the colon. This endogenous microbiota forms a symbiotic relationship with their eukaryotic host and this close partnership helps maintain homeostasis by performing essential and non-redundant tasks (e.g. nutrition/energy and, immune system balance, pathogen exclusion). Although this relationship is essential and beneficial to the host, various events (e.g. infection, diet, stress, inflammation) may impact microbial composition, leading to the formation of a dysbiotic microbiota, further impacting on health and disease states. For example, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively termed inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), have been associated with the establishment of a dysbiotic microbiota. In addition, extra-intestinal disorders such as obesity and metabolic syndrome are also associated with the development of a dysbiotic microbiota. Consequently, there is an increasing interest in harnessing the power of the microbiome and modulating its composition as a means to alleviate intestinal pathologies/disorders and maintain health status. In this review, we will discuss the emerging relationship between the microbiota and development of colorectal cancer as well as present evidence that microbial manipulation (probiotic, prebiotic) impacts disease development.},

Recent studies have shown that chronic IFN-gamma signaling plays an essential role in inflammation-mediated colorectal cancer development in vivo, whereas genome-wide association studies have linked human UC risk loci to IFNG, the gene that encodes IFN-gamma. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the butyrate-IFN-gamma-colonic inflammation axis are not well defined. Here we showed that colonic mucosa from patients with UC exhibit increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) activation, and this STAT1 hyperactivation is correlated with increased T cell infiltration. Butyrate treatment-induced apoptosis of wild-type T cells but not Fas-deficient (Fas(lpr)) or FasL-deficient (Fas(gld)) T cells, revealing a potential role of Fas-mediated apoptosis of T cells as a mechanism of butyrate function. Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) was found to bind to the Fas promoter in T cells, and butyrate inhibits HDAC1 activity to induce Fas promoter hyperacetylation and Fas upregulation in T cells. Knocking down gpr109a or slc5a8, the genes that encode for receptor and transporter of butyrate, respectively, resulted in altered expression of genes related to multiple inflammatory signaling pathways, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), in mouse colonic epithelial cells in vivo. Butyrate effectively inhibited IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 activation, resulting in inhibition of iNOS upregulation in human colon epithelial and carcinoma cells in vitro. Our data thus suggest that butyrate delivers a double-hit: induction of T cell apoptosis to eliminate the source of inflammation and suppression of IFN-gamma-mediated inflammation in colonic epithelial cells, to suppress colonic inflammation.},
