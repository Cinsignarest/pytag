   abstract = {Crohn's disease is frequently associated with nutritional deficiencies, often a result of disease activity and poor oral intake. This study investigated the adequacy of dietary intake, based on the Canadian Dietary Reference Intake, in ambulatory patients with Crohn's disease and a normal body mass index (BMI; calculated as kg/m(2)). This was a cross-sectional study of 74 patients with mean age of 35.7+/-1.4 years and BMI of 23.05+/-0.45. All patients completed a 7-day food record and a diary for the Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Mean Crohn's Disease Activity Index was 138.99+/-11.38. Energy and protein intakes were within the recommended levels of intake, but total carbohydrates, fat, and saturated fat intake exceeded the recommended levels of <55%, <35%, and <10% in 39.2%, 27%, and 59.5% of the patients, respectively. Micronutrient intakes were suboptimal most notably for folate, vitamins C, E, and calcium. There were no substantial differences between patients with active and inactive disease in terms of failure to meet the Dietary Reference Intake. In conclusion, in this population sample, a large number of ambulatory patients with Crohn's disease have suboptimal dietary patterns despite a normal BMI and inactive disease. Dietary counseling and supplementation may be warranted in this patient population.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Intestinal transplantation has been increasingly performed in patients with short bowel syndrome and irreversible gut failure with successful outcomes. In parallel a common association was observed between gut failure and different urological disorders. To our knowledge this study is the first to address such an important clinical observation with special reference to the underlying disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 175 consecutive adult intestinal recipients were reviewed. Data were compiled and described according to the documented urogenital disorder, cause of intestinal failure and treatment modality, including transplantation. RESULTS: Of the patients 43 experienced a total of 53 urogenital disorders for an overall incidence of 25%, including 24 (56%) who had the disorder before referral and 19 (44%) in whom the morbidity developed as a result of transplantation. Interestingly hypercoagulability, pseudo-obstruction, Crohn's disease and Gardner's syndrome were the underlying urogenital and intestinal disorder pathologies in 6.3% of the study patients. Treatment for prior urogenital disorders, including malignancy, precipitated intestinal failure in 3.4% of the referred patients. Reciprocally surgical treatment for the primary intestinal disease and management of gut failure by total parenteral nutrition, followed by transplantation, resulted in different urogenital complications in 17.7% of the total population with an 8.6% incidence of chronic renal failure. CONCLUSIONS: Gut failure and intestinal transplantation are commonly associated with different urogenital disorders. Accordingly a designated urological service should be considered part of the multidisciplinary team required for treating this unique population.},

   abstract = {There is no known cure for Crohn's disease (CD), but a better understanding of the evidence base of both established treatments (such as enteral nutrition, corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylates and immunosuppressive agents) and emerging treatments (such as the anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) agents, infliximab and adalimumab) provides opportunities to improve and maintain the quality of life for children with the disease. This article provides an overview of the evidence base of current medical treatments that are used to induce and maintain remission in CD. Exclusive enteral nutrition is recommended as the first line of treatment for the induction of remission in paediatric CD. Corticosteroids are also effective for inducing remission but may be associated with significant adverse events. Patients with chronically active CD may benefit from immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine and methotrexate. Infliximab is effective for inducing remission in patients who continue to have significant active disease despite the use of conventional treatments. Adalimumab may be indicated for patients who develop a severe allergic reaction to infliximab or those who initially respond to infliximab but subsequently lose their response. Treatments that have been shown to be effective for the maintenance of remission include azathioprine, methotrexate, infliximab and adalimumab. Recent evidence also suggests that long-term enteral nutritional supplementation with patients taking about half of their daily calorie requirements as enteral nutrition may be an effective strategy for the maintenance of remission in CD. The available evidence does not support the use of corticosteroids or 5-aminosalicylates as maintenance therapy for CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is characterised by recurrent flare-ups alternating with periods of remission. A number of interventions are currently used in clinical practice to try and maintain remission in Crohn's disease but the evidence base for some of them may be questionable. AIM: To review the available evidence on interventions, which are currently used to maintain remission in Crohn's disease. METHODS: The Cochrane Library and Medline (Pubmed) were searched for level 1 evidence on specific interventions. Search terms included 'Crohn's disease or synonyms', 'remission or synonyms' and the names of specific interventions. RESULTS: Azathioprine, infliximab and adalimumab are effective at maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. Natalizumab is also effective, but there are concerns about its potential association with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Long-term enteral nutritional supplementation, enteric-coated omega-3 fatty acids and intramuscular methotrexate may also be effective but the evidence for these is based on relatively small studies. The available evidence does not support the use of oral 5-aminosalicylates agents, corticosteroids, anti-mycobacterial agents, probiotics or ciclosporin as maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: A better understanding of the evidence base of existing interventions could result in the use of treatments, which are more likely to lead to improved patient outcomes.},

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of exclusive enteral nutrition, which is increasingly being used as primary therapy for CD, on plasma antioxidant concentrations in children with active CD. METHODS: In a double-blind randomised controlled trial, 15 children with active CD (mean age, 11.3 years, range 6.8-15.7) attending a paediatric gastroenterology referral centre, were assigned to receive either a standard polymeric diet (Group S, n=8) or a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet (Group G, n=7) as primary therapy for active CD. Plasma concentrations of selenium, urates, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, glutathione, and also malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured at baseline and after 4 weeks of exclusive enteral nutritional treatment. RESULTS: Mean (95% CI) selenium concentration of the cohort increased significantly from 0.82 micromol/l (0.72, 0.91) to 1.14 micromol/l (0.98, 1.3), P<0.001. There were, however, significant reductions in mean concentrations of vitamin C {11.8 mg/l (7.7, 15.8) to 6.5 mg/l (4.5, 8.7), P=0.01} and vitamin E {11.3 mg/l (10.3, 12.4) to 9.4 mg/l (8.7, 10.1), P=0.03}. The concentrations of vitamin A, urates, glutathione and MDA did not change significantly over the study period. Glutamine supplementation did not have any significant effect on plasma antioxidant concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Significant changes in circulating antioxidant concentrations occurred in children with active CD receiving exclusive enteral nutritional treatment. Glutamine supplementation was not beneficial in improving plasma antioxidant status.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prevention of relapse is a major issue in the management of Crohn's disease. Corticosteroids and 5-ASA preparations are not effective for the maintenance of remission. Methotrexate, infliximab, 6-mercaptopurine and its prodrug, azathioprine may be effective in maintaining remission, but these drugs may cause significant adverse events. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of enteral nutrition for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE (1966 to January 2007), EMBASE (1984 to January 2007) the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2006) and the IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were searched. The articles cited in each publication were hand searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials which compared enteral nutrition with no intervention, placebo or with any other intervention were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality of included studies were independently performed by two authors. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of clinical or endoscopic relapse as defined by the primary studies. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Statistical pooling of the results of these studies was not possible because the control interventions, and the way outcomes were assessed differed greatly between the two studies. In one study (Takagi 2006), patients who received half of their total daily calorie requirements as elemental diet and the remaining half by normal diet had a significantly lower relapse rate compared to patients who received unrestricted normal diet (9 of 26 versus 16 of 25; OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.94). In the other study (Verma 2001), elemental and polymeric feeds (providing between 35 and 50% of patients' pretrial calorie intake in addition to unrestricted normal food) were equally effective for maintenance of remission and allowing withdrawal of steroid therapy (8 of 19 versus 6 of 14; OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.92). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that supplementary enteral nutritional may be effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Whilst larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, enteral nutritional supplementation could be considered as an alternative or as an adjunct to maintenance drug therapy in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Bile acid malabsorption has been shown to be associated with diarrhea in cases such as ileal resection Crohn's disease of the ileum, and radiation enteritis. The mechanisms of bile acid-induced diarrhea are not fully understood. Although the induction of colonic chloride secretion in response to bile acids has been extensively investigated, to date the direct effect of bile acids on intestinal chloride absorption has not been well defined. Therefore, the current studies were undertaken to investigate the effect of bile acids on the apical Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange process utilizing Caco2 monolayers as an in vitro cellular model. Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity was measured as DIDS-sensitive pH gradient-driven (36)Cl uptake. The results are summarized as follows: (i) short-term exposure (20 min) of Caco2 cells to taurodeoxycholate (TDC; 200 microM) and glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC; 200 microM) acids significantly inhibited apical Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange (by approximately 60-70%); (ii) the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM blocked the inhibition by TDC; (iii) the reduction in Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange by TDC was reversed by the PKC inhibitor, chelerythrine chloride; (iv) functional and inhibitor studies indicated that TDC induced inhibition of Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange was mediated via the activation of the PKC beta I isoform; (v) the effect of TDC on apical Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange was completely blocked by the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 (5 microM); and (vi) the PKA inhibitor, RpcAMP, had no effect on TDC induced inhibition of Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange. In conclusion, our studies provide direct evidence for inhibition of human intestinal apical Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity by bile acids via Ca(2+)-, PI3 kinase-, and PKC beta I-dependent pathways in Caco2 cells.},

METHODS: From 1984 to 2004, 161 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease (81 males; mean age, 33 +/- 10 years) underwent, as a first operation, an elective ileocecal resection without temporary stoma. Postoperatively, 15 patients (9 percent) developed abdominal septic complications, including abscess and anastomotic leaks. Possible factors for postoperative intra-abdominal septic complication were analyzed by both univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: There was no postoperative death. Multivariate analysis found only four independent factors associated with a higher risk of postoperative intra-abdominal septic complication: poor nutritional status (odds ratio, 6.23 (1.75-22.52)), intra-abdominal abscess discovered during surgery (odds ratio, 7.47 (1.5-37.69)), preoperative steroids use more than three months (odds ratio, 5.95 (1.04-34.1)), and recurrent clinical episode of Crohn's disease (odds ratio (per episode), 1.38 (1.03-1.9)). CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent clinical episode of Crohn's disease, preoperative steroids use, poor nutritional status, and the presence of abscess at the time of surgery significantly increased the risk of septic abdominal complications after first ileocecal resection for Crohn's disease. Knowledge of these risk factors could permit to propose a temporary stoma in very high-risk patients (i.e., with 3 or more risk factors).},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advances in bioengineering have spawned various imaging modalities which have revolutionized endoscopy. Some of these technologies provide real-time, high-resolution, subcellular imaging. This review provides an update on these technologies and their role in the evaluation of colorectal neoplasia. RECENT FINDINGS: Narrow band imaging has been shown to visualize capillary patterns in early cancer and is complementary to magnification endoscopy. Optical coherence tomography has been used to evaluate neoplastic progression and distinguish Crohn's from ulcerative colitis. Confocal endomicroscopy has been shown to accurately predict neoplastic changes in polyps and identify areas of neoplasia in patients with colitis. Among the spectroscopic techniques, autofluorescence is best studied in the colon and has been used to identify adenomas and dysplasia in inflammatory bowel disease. Endocytoscopy is a relatively new technology but shows promise in distinguishing neoplastic lesions. SUMMARY: Recently a number of imaging technologies have arisen that have the potential to enhance our detection of colorectal neoplasia. Several of these, such as autofluorescent imaging and narrow band imaging, are 'red flag' techniques which enhance our visualization of mucosal change(s). Complementary technologies, such as confocal endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy, provide subcellular imaging. Combined with a 'red flag' technique, these may transform our approach to colonoscopy, allowing the real-time detection and diagnosis of neoplasia.},

Principal component analysis was used to classify individuals into three subsets based on patterns of biomarker expression. Set 1 included normal subjects and CD patients with mild disease and good responses to therapy, thus defining "normal" biomarker expression. CD patients in set 2, characterized by low expression of all five biomarkers, had moderate to severe disease and poor responses to immunosuppressive and anti-TNF therapy. Patients in set 3, characterized by low expression of RelA, A20, and pIgR, normal TNF and elevated IL-8, had acute inflammation that responded well to therapy.

   abstract = {Ghrelin possesses various biological activities -- it stimulates growth hormone (GH) release, plays a major role in energy metabolism, and is one of the hormones that affects body composition. It also plays a role in modulating immune response and inflammatory processes. In this study we aimed to determine whether serum ghrelin levels had correlation with markers associated with disease activation. We also investigated any probable relationship between serum ghrelin level and nutritional status. Serum levels of ghrelin and its relationship with disease activity and nutritional status were evaluated in 34 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 25 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), and 30 healthy controls. Serum ghrelin levels, serum IGF-1 and GH levels, and markers of disease activity (sedimentation, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen) were measured in all subjects. Body composition and nutritional status was assessed by both direct (by anthropometry) and indirect (by bioimpedance) methods. Serum ghrelin levels were significantly higher in patients with active UC and CD than in those in remission (108 +/- 11 pg/ml vs. 71 +/- 13 pg/ml for UC patients, P < 0.001; 110 +/- 10 pg/ml vs. 75 +/- 15 pg/ml for CD patients, P < 0.001). Circulating ghrelin levels in UC and CD patients were positively correlated with sedimentation, fibrinogen and CRP and was negatively correlated with IGF-1, BMI, TSFT, MAC, fat mass (%), and fat free mass (%). This study demonstrates that patients with active IBD have higher serum ghrelin levels than patients in remission and high levels of circulating ghrelin correlate with the severity of disease and the activity markers. Ghrelin levels in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients show an appositive correlation with IGF-1 and bioelectrical impedance analysis, body composition, and anthropometric assessments. Finally, we arrived at the conclusion that ghrelin level may be important in determination of the activity in IBD patients and evaluation of nutritional status.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recently an association was shown between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11209026, within the interleukin-23 receptor (IL23R) locus and Crohn's disease (CD) as a consequence of a genome-wide association study of this disease in adults. We examined the effects of this and other previously reported SNPs at this locus with respect to CD in children. METHODS: By using data from our ongoing genome-wide association study in our cohort of 142 pediatric CD patients and 281 matched controls, we investigated the association of the previously reported SNPs at the IL23R locus with the childhood form of this disease. RESULTS: By using the Fisher exact test, the minor allele frequency of rs11209026 in the patients was 1.75%, whereas it was 6.61% in the controls, yielding a protective odds ratio (OR) of 0.25 (95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.65; 1-sided P = 9.2 x 10(-4)). Furthermore, of all the SNPs previously reported, rs11209026 was associated the most strongly. A subsequent family based association test (which is more resistant to population stratification) with 65 sets of trios derived from our initial patient cohort yielded significant association with rs11209026 in a transmission disequilibrium test (1-sided P = .0017). In contrast, no association was detected to the caspase-recruitment domain 15 gene for the inflammatory bowel disease phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The OR of the IL23R variant in our pediatric study is highly comparable with that reported previously in a non-Jewish adult inflammatory bowel disease case-control cohort (OR, 0.26). As such, variants in the IL23R gene confer a similar magnitude of risk of CD to children as for their adult counterparts.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, typically with a relapsing and remitting clinical course. The intestinal inflammation in IBD is controlled by a complex interplay of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. Innate immunity comprises a set of distinct elements, which includes circulating cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, and resident intestinal immune cells (dendritic and Paneth cells), as well as intestinal epithelium and cellular products, including antimicrobial peptides such as defensins and cathelicidins. Different components of innate immunity in IBD have been suggested to be defective or impaired. The human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and the human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) have emerged as potential tools for the modulation of intestinal inflammation and repair. The greatest evidence supporting the use of colony-stimulating factors in intestinal inflammation comes from studies conducted in active Crohn's disease (CD) patients treated with sargramostim and filgrastim, but evidence for its recommendation as treatment remains weak, as the majority of studies are open label, nonrandomized, and with a small number of patients.},

   abstract = {The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), notably Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are systemic inflammatory diseases primarily involving the gastrointestinal tract. Twenty percent to 40% of patients with IBD develop extraintestinal inflammation and symptoms, known as extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs).1-7 The most common EIMs affect the joints, skin, eyes, and biliary tract. The EIMs associated with IBD bear a negative impact on patients with UC and CD. Thus, the successful treatment of EIMs is essential for improving the quality of life of IBD patients. For most EIMs, their resolution often parallels that of the active IBD in both timing and therapy required. However, some EIM such as axial arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis run a clinical course independent of IBD disease activity. The advent of biologic response modifiers, e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) inhibitors, has improved the treatment of IBD and its associated EIMs. This article reviews the therapeutic experiences of the 2 most widely used anti-TNF neutralizing antibodies, infliximab and adalimumab, for immune-mediated EIM of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Historically, corticosteroids have been the most commonly used class of medication for induction of remission in Crohn's disease (CD). Corticosteroids down regulate production of inflammatory cytokines and interfere with NF-kappaB production, thereby blunting inflammatory response. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of traditional corticosteroids (given orally or intravenously) for induction of remission in CD. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders (IBD/FBD) Group Specialized Trial Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov. No language restrictions were applied. Reference lists of trials and review articles, as well as recent proceedings from major gastroenterology meetings were manually searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized, controlled clinical trials of traditional, systemic corticosteroids for the induction of remission of active CD were included in this review. Control groups included patients receiving either placebo or 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA). The study population included patients of any age with active CD (as defined by the study authors or validated clinical activity indices), receiving any formulation of systemically available corticosteroid by any oral or parenteral methods of delivery. The primary outcome was induction of remission of CD. Secondary outcomes included clinical response, change in mean CDAI, adverse events and the proportion of patients withdrawing due to adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality using Jadad's criteria. A random or fixed effects model was chosen based on an assessment of heterogeneity, and studies were weighted using the DerSimonian & Laird or the Mantel-Haenszel method accordingly. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 4.2.10 software. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies compared corticosteroids to placebo and six studies compared corticosteroids to 5-ASA. Corticosteroids were found to be significantly more effective than placebo at inducing remission in CD (RR 1.99; 95% CI 1.51 to 2.64; P < 0.00001). Corticosteroids were found to be more effective than 5-ASA at inducing remission in studies with long follow-up duration (i.e. > 15 weeks; RR 1.65; 95% CI 1.33 to 2.03; P < 0.00001). Corticosteroids induced adverse events in a higher proportion of patients than placebo (RR 4.89; 95% CI 1.98 to 12.07; P = 0.0006), or low-dose 5-ASA (RR 2.38; 95% CI 1.34 to 4.25; P = 0.003). No difference existed in the proportion of patients experiencing adverse events when steroids were compared to high-dose 5-ASA. Steroids did not induce more study withdrawals due to adverse events than either placebo or 5-ASA. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission in patients with CD, particularly when used for more than 15 weeks. Although corticosteroids cause more adverse events than either placebo or low-dose 5-ASA, these adverse events did not lead to increased study withdrawal in the included studies. Further information is required to determine the optimal duration of treatment and tapering protocol to maximize the efficacy of treatment with corticosteroids. Additionally, further study is required to determine whether corticosteroids are more effective in patients with certain phenotypes or when administered intravenously.},

This study assessed the clinical and radiologic characteristics of TMC in children with IBD. METHODS: A systematic search identified patients with IBD-associated TMC and matched them by age to controls with ulcerative colitis without evidence of TMC. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared with conditional logistic regression. Abdominal X-rays were interpreted by two blinded radiologists and findings were compared with controls. RESULTS: Ten children with TMC (median age 12.6 [7.3-15.5] yr) were matched with 20 controls (median age 12.8 [6.8-15.2] yr). Altered level of consciousness and hypotension were rare in children with TMC. Fever (P= 0.005), tachycardia (P= 0.0001), dehydration (P= 0.01), and electrolyte abnormalities (P= 0.0002) were more common in children with TMC than controls. Air-fluid levels (P= 0.005), intestinal thickening (P= 0.006), and abnormal colonic haustra (P= 0.012) were more commonly seen on X-rays of TMC cases. Transverse colon luminal diameter >or=56 mm was strongly suggestive of TMC (sensitivity 90%, specificity 90%, area under the ROC curve 0.91). No child with TMC died and 70% required colectomy during admission. Two of the three with intact colons at discharge required second-line therapy during the subsequent year. CONCLUSIONS: Colonic dilatation >or=56 mm in children with IBD strongly suggests TMC, if clinical signs are present. Mental alteration and hypotension may be less common in children than in adults. TMC in children with IBD is associated with poor outcome, with a high rate of corticosteroid failure.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder caused by environmental and genetic factors. The purpose of this study was to analyse the possible influence of functional variants of genes of OCTN cation transporters on the carnitine ester profile of patients with CD. Genotyping for SLC22A4 1672C --> T, SLC22A5-207G --> C mutations and three common NOD2 variants (R702W, G908R and 1007finsC) were performed in 100 adult CD patients and in ninety-four healthy controls by direct sequencing. The carnitine ester profile was determined using ESI triple quadrupole tandem MS. Contrary to the NOD2/CARD15 mutations, none of the SLC variants showed increased prevalence in the CD group, the prevalence of TC haplotype did not differ between the patients and the controls. In the mixed group of CD patients the fasting propionyl- (0.243 (sem 0.008) v. 0.283 (sem 0.014) micromol/l), butyryl- (0.274 (sem 0.009) v. 0.301 (sem 0.013)) and isovalerylcarnitine (0.147 (sem 0.006) v. 0.185 (sem 0.009)) levels were decreased; while the level of octenoyl- (0.086 (sem 0.006) v. 0.069 (sem 0.005)), myristoleyl- (0.048 (sem 0.003) v. 0.037 (sem 0.003)), palmitoyl- (0.140 (sem 0.005) v. 0.122 (sem 0.004)) and oleylcarnitine (0.172 (sem 0.006) v. 0.156 (sem 0.008); P < 0.05 in all comparisons) were increased. After sorting the patients into SLC22A genotype-specific subgroups, no significant differences could be observed between them. The carnitine ester profile data suggest selective involvement of the carnitine esters in CD patients, probably due to their altered metabolism.},

   abstract = {AIM: To assess the intestinal permeability (IP) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and study the association of IP with the patient and disease characteristics. METHODS: One hundred and twenty five consecutive patients of CD (Males: 66) were diagnosed on the basis of a combination of standard clinical, endoscopic, imaging and histological features. CD activity index (CDAI) was used to calculate the activity of the disease while the behavior of the disease was assessed by the modified Montreal classification. IP was measured by the ratio of the percentage excretion of ingested doses of lactulose and mannitol in urine (LMR). The upper limit of normality of LMR (0.037) was derived from 22 healthy controls. RESULTS: Thirty six percent of patients with CD had increased IP. There was no significant difference in mannitol excretion (patients vs controls=12.5% vs 14.2%, P=0.4652), but lactulose excretion was significantly higher in patients compared to healthy controls (patients vs controls=0.326% vs 0.293%, P=0.0391). The mean LMR was also significantly higher in the patients as compared to healthy controls [0.027 (0.0029-0.278) vs 0.0164 (0.0018-0.0548), P=0.0044]. Male patients had a higher LMR compared to females [0.036 (95% CI 0.029, 0.046) vs 0.022 (95% CI 0.0178, 0.028) (P=0.0024), though there was no difference in the number of patients with abnormal IP in both the sexes. Patients with an ileo-colonic disease had a higher LMR than those with only colonic disease [0.045 (95% CI 0.033, 0.06) vs 0.021 (95% CI 0.017, 0.025) (P<0.001)]. Of patients with ileo-colonic disease, 57.8% had an abnormal IP, compared to 26.7% with colonic and 15.6% with small intestinal disease. Patients with a stricturing disease had significantly higher LMR compared to non-fistulising non-stricturing disease [0.043 (95% CI 0.032, 0.058) vs 0.024 (95% CI 0.019, 0.029) (P=0.0062)]. There was no correlation of IP with age, disease activity, duration of illness, D-xylose absorption, upper GI involvement, perianal disease, and extra-intestinal manifestations. On multiple regression analysis, male gender and ileo-colonic disease were independent factors associated with increased IP. Gender, location, behavior of the disease and upper GI involvement could explain up to 23% of variability in IP (R2=0.23). CONCLUSION: IP was increased in 36% of patients with CD. Male gender and an ileo-colonic disease were the independent factors associated with increased IP.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Malnutrition is a common feature in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), which leads to frequent infections and poor prognosis. In view of the rising incidence of CD in India we planned this study to assess the nutritional status of patients with CD. METHODS: Nutritional status of 112 patients (mean age 35.9 [SD 11.7] years; 61 men) with CD was assessed by anthropometric, dietary and biochemical parameters. Patients were considered malnourished if 3 or more anthropometric parameters (% ideal body weight [IBW], % tricep skin fold [TSF], %mid upper arm circumference [MUAC], and % mid arm muscle circumference [MAMC], body mass index [BMI]) were abnormal. Dietary intake was assessed by a 24-hour dietary recall along with a semi-quantitative food frequency method. Eighty volunteers were taken as healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: At the time of assessment, 77 patients were in remission and 35 had active disease. The values of BMI, MUAC, TSF and mid arm fat area (MAFA) in patients were significantly lower than those in healthy controls. MAMC and mid arm muscle area (MAMA) of patients and controls were comparable. TSF (Rem vs HC = 10.4 [2.8-71] vs 16 [3-41]) and MAFA (Rem vs HC = 1236 [240-7757] vs 1858 [322-5650]) of the patients in the remission phase were significantly lower than those of healthy controls; the remaining parameters were comparable. There was no difference in the dietary intake of patients in the remission and active phases, and healthy controls. The percentage energy fulfillment of the patients was lower than that of healthy controls. Twenty-nine of 35 (82.8%) patients in the active and 30 of 77 (38.9%) patients in the remission phase were malnourished (OR 7.5, 95% CI 2.8-20.4). The overall prevalence of malnutrition was 52.6% among patients. CONCLUSION: The percentage of malnourished patients in the active and remission phases of the disease was 82.8% and 38.9%, respectively, possibly due to low percentage energy fulfillment.},

   abstract = {Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) is fundamental to maintain the intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis through its control action on cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. TGFbeta1 dysregulation has been observed in several chronic human diseases, including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and colon carcinoma. In the first two conditions, a marked oxidative stress is consistently present, while in the third one, levels of reactive oxygen species tend to be significantly lower than in the surrounding normal tissue. Lipid-derived compounds such as the aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) or cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols) were shown able to induce expression and synthesis of TGFbeta1, an event which can be detrimental or beneficial, essentially depending on its actual intensity. Understanding how specific dietary lipids may influence the complex molecular signaling underlying this cytokine expression, may provide new indications for therapeutic and preventive strategies in inflammatory bowel diseases and colon carcinoma.},

   abstract = {Bowel commensals appear to be an important source of antigens that drive the chronic immune inflammation characteristic of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)]. Biopsy-associated bacteria are assumed to be particularly relevant in bacteriological investigations of IBD because they are assumed to be located on the mucosal surface and hence close to immunological cells. This investigation analysed the bacterial collections associated with bowel biopsies, aspirates of residual fluid after bowel cleansing and faeces from IBD patients and non-IBD subjects in Edmonton, Canada, and Mexico City, Mexico. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA gene sequences produced profiles of the bacterial collections and their similarities were compared. Similarity analysis showed that the profiles did not cluster according to disease status, but that Canadian and Mexican profiles could be differentiated by this method. Comparison of biopsy, aspirate and faecal samples obtained from the same subject showed that, on average, the profiles were highly similar. Therefore, biopsy-associated bacteria are likely to represent, at least in part, contaminants from the fluid, which resembles a faecal solution, that pools in the bowel after cleansing prior to endoscopy.},

Inflammation of the defunctioned mucosa seems to be related to deprivation of luminal nutrients, in particular short chain fatty acids. Histologic abnormalities include damage of the epithelium and reparative changes with crypt distortion and branching, a mixed acute and chronic inflammatory infiltrate with crypt abscesses and lymphoid hyperplasia, Paneth cell metaplasia and thickening of the muscularis mucosae. We report a case of diversion colitis in a 51-year-old female with Crohn's disease with multiple submucosal microcarcinoids in the rectal stump 17 years after diversion and discuss the hypothesis that hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions of neuroendocrine cells can result from proliferative response to chronic inflammation and repair, as well as epithelial neoplasms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have varied in the criteria used to classify patients as having Crohn disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), or indeterminate colitis (IC). Patients undergoing an initial evaluation for IBD will often undergo a series of diagnostic tests, including barium upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through, abdominal CT, upper endoscopy, and colonoscopy with biopsies. Other tests performed less frequently include magnetic resonance imaging scans, serological testing, and capsule endoscopy. The large amount of clinical information obtained may make a physician uncertain as to whether to label a patient as having CD or UC. Nevertheless, to facilitate the conduct of epidemiological studies in children, to allow the entry of children into clinical trials, and to allow physicians to more clearly discuss diagnosis with their patients, it is important that clinicians be able to differentiate between CD and UC. METHODS: A consensus conference regarding the diagnosis and classification of pediatric IBD was organized by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. The meeting included 10 pediatric gastroenterologists and 4 pediatric pathologists. The primary aim was to determine the utility of endoscopy and histology in establishing the diagnosis of CD and UC. Each member of the group was assigned a topic for review. Topics evaluated included differentiating inflammatory bowel disease from acute self-limited colitis, endoscopic and histological features that allow differentiation between CD and UC, upper endoscopic features seen in both CD and UC, ileal inflammation and "backwash ileitis" in UC, patchiness and rectal sparing in pediatric IBD, periappendiceal inflammation in CD and UC, and definitions of IC. RESULTS: Patients with UC may have histological features such as microscopic inflammation of the ileum, histological gastritis, periappendiceal inflammation, patchiness, and relative rectal sparing at the time of diagnosis. These findings should not prompt the clinician to change the diagnosis from UC to CD. Other endoscopic findings, such as macroscopic cobblestoning, segmental colitis, ileal stenosis and ulceration, perianal disease, and multiple granulomas in the small bowel or colon more strongly suggest a diagnosis of CD. An algorithm is provided to enable the clinician to differentiate more reliably between these 2 entities. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations and algorithm presented here aim to assist the clinician in differentiating childhood UC from CD. We hope the recommendations in this report will reduce variability among practitioners in how they use the terms "ulcerative colitis," "Crohn disease," and "indeterminate colitis." The authors hope that progress being made in genetic, serological, and imaging studies leads to more reliable phenotyping.},

Here, we show that the dsbA gene, encoding a periplasmic oxidoreductase, was required for AIEC strain LF82 to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells and to survive within macrophages. The LF82-DeltadsbA mutant did not express flagella and, probably as a consequence of this, did not express type 1 pili. The role of DsbA in adhesion is restricted to the loss of flagella and type 1 pili, as forced contact between bacteria and cells and induced expression of type 1 pili restored the wild-type phenotype. In contrast, the dsbA gene is essential for AIEC LF82 bacteria to survive within macrophages, irrespective of the loss of flagella and type 1 pilus expression, and the survival ability of LF82-DeltadsbA was as low as that of the nonpathogenic E. coli K-12, which was efficiently killed by macrophages. We also provide evidence that the dsbA gene is needed for LF82 bacteria to grow and survive in an acidic and nutrient-poor medium that partly mimics the harsh environment of the phagocytic vacuole. In addition, under such stress conditions dsbA transcription is highly up-regulated. Finally, the CpxRA signaling pathway does not play a role in regulation of dsbA expression in AIEC LF82 bacteria under conditions similar to those of mature phagolysosomes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Variants in the DLG5 gene have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in samples from some, but not all populations. In particular, 2 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), R30Q (rs1248696) and P1371Q (rs2289310), have been associated with an increased risk of IBD, and a common haplotype (called haplotype "A") has been associated with reduced risk. METHODS: We genotyped R30Q, P1371Q, and a haplotype A tagging SNP (rs2289311) in a New Zealand Caucasian cohort of 389 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, 406 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 416 population controls. Each SNP was tested for association with disease susceptibility and clinical phenotypes. We also performed a meta-analysis of R30Q data from published association studies. RESULTS: The haplotype A tagging SNP was associated with reduced risk of IBD at the 0.05 significance level (P=0.036) with an allelic odds ratio of 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.99). Association with haplotype A was strongest (odds ratio approximately 0.57) in UC patients with familial IBD or extraintestinal manifestations. The R30Q and P1371Q polymorphisms were not significantly associated with UC, CD, or IBD. Analysis of male and female data did not find any gender-specific associations. Meta-analysis gave no evidence of association of R30Q with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis demonstrates that the minor allele of R30Q is not a risk factor for IBD across populations. This study provides some evidence that DLG5 haplotype A is associated with reduced risk of IBD in the New Zealand Caucasian population, but this association will need to be replicated in an independent sample.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Published association studies of the TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in caucasian populations have inconsistent results. We tested two TLR4 variants for association with IBD in the New Zealand caucasian population and assessed the cumulative evidence for association of TLR4 Asp299Gly and IBD. METHODS: The TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms were genotyped and tested for case-control frequency differences in a New Zealand white cohort of 389 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, 405 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 416 population controls. Meta-analysis using a random effects model was performed to test whether 299Gly carriage was associated with UC, CD, or phenotypes of CD patients. RESULTS: There were no significant allele or genotype frequency differences between cases and controls or between CD phenotypes in our New Zealand data. Meta-analysis did not identify any significant associations between CD phenotypes and 299Gly carriage. However, meta-analysis demonstrated significantly higher 299Gly carrier frequencies in CD patients (odds ratio 1.45, 95% CI 1.11-1.90) and in IBD patients (odds ratio 1.36, 95% CI 1.01-1.84) compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis provides evidence that Asp299Gly is associated with CD and IBD in whites. Only the Asp299Gly polymorphism has been consistently genotyped in previous TLR4 studies with IBD patients, therefore other TLR4 variants with stronger associations with IBD may exist. Additional well-powered studies of Asp299Gly and other TLR4 variants are urgently needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Very long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have modulating effects on inflammatory mechanisms. Seal and fish oils are rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and possibly therefore high doses of nasoduodenally administered seal oil rapidly relieved inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated joint pain in two recent studies. In the present study, we compared the effects of short-term oral administration of seal oil and cod liver oil on IBD-related joint pain, leucotriene B(4) level, serum fatty acid profile and IBD activity. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 21 had Crohn's disease and 17 ulcerative colitis. Ten milliters of seal oil (n=18) or cod liver oil (n=20) was self-administered orally 3 times a day for 14 days before meals in a double-blind setting. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two intervention groups or between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. There was a tendency toward improvement in several joint pain parameters after both seal oil and cod liver oil administration. Further, plasma leucotriene B(4) concentration, serum Sigma n-6 to Sigma n-3, and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) to eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) ratios were similarly reduced after administration of seal oil and cod liver oil. CONCLUSION: No significant differences in the two treatment groups were seen; in both groups, the changes in several joint pain parameters, leucotriene B(4) level of plasma, and serum fatty acid profile were putatively favourable.},

   abstract = {Fermented foods have been used since prehistoric times. Their number, variety and geographic origin are considerable, and different substrates and agents including bacteria, yeasts and moulds have been used in their preparation. In the last few decades the scientific approach to the study of the participating microorganisms and the resulting products have provided a better understanding of their biological importance. Among the many health-related properties of fermented foods, effects on blood pressure have been described after casein hydrolysis by lactic acid bacteria. Peptides with antimicrobial activity, mainly against Gram-negative bacteria, and derived from casein have also been identified. This could explain, at least in part, the antidiarrheal effects of fermented products including those on traveler's diarrhea and against colonization by Helicobacter pylori. One of the best known advantages of fermented milk products is their capacity to improve lactose tolerance in hypolactasic subjects. With the growing prevalence of allergies and inflammatory bowel diseases, considerable interest has been focused on the effects of lactic acid bacteria in these conditions; there is evidence that these agents are associated with improvements in allergy; no such evidence exists for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. A cholesterol-lowering capacity has also been described for some microorganisms. Not all the fermenting microorganisms have probiotic capacities as the latter are strain-specific.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncommon in children younger than 2 years of age. The criteria for differentiating IBD from other diseases with similar clinical presentation is unclear. We describe 16 patients who, between 1984 and 2004, received a histological diagnosis of IBD during the first two years of life. Six patients presented with histological Crohn's disease, eight with ulcerative colitis and two with indeterminate colitis. The median age at diagnosis was 125 days (range 1 day to 18 months) and the medium follow up was 89 months (range 65 days to 20 years). The disease appeared to be very severe: four children (25%) underwent total parenteral nutrition (TPN), two received colectomy (12.5%) and three patients died. Many of the patients required an aggressive, multidrug, immunosuppressive approach (azathioprine [AZA], Infliximab, thalidomide, cyclosporine A). One child presented with a hypogammaglobulinaemia without any specific immunodeficiency, while in the other patients, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (4 cases) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (2 cases) were identified. In 6/16 cases, allergic colitis was first considered; these cases initially underwent cow's milk protein-free diet as the only therapy before IBD was finally diagnosed. In conclusion, early IBD has a severe prognosis and often needs an aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, an improper diagnosis of allergic colitis might cause an important diagnostic delay. Some severe immunodeficiencies, such as WAS and CGD, may represent a problem in terms of differential diagnosis and might be wrongly diagnosed as very early onset IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) present in childhood in 15% to 25% of cases. The aim of therapy in children is not only to guarantee normal growth but also to prevent relapse and to maintain remission. Steroids are effective to induce remission; however, resistance, dependency, and irreversible side effects can develop. The aim of this study was to determine whether treatment with repeated infusions of autologous red blood cells (RBCs) loaded with dexamethasone 21-phosphate (Dex 21-P) is safe and allows maintenance of long-term remission in children with steroid-dependent Crohn disease (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen consecutive pediatric patients who met the inclusion criteria were admitted to the study. Infusions of autologous RBCs loaded with Dex 21-P were performed every 4 weeks; the mean duration of treatment was 24 months. At the beginning of treatment and after 6, 12, and 24 months, we performed clinical evaluation according to the Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (pCDAI). Assessment of body mass in dexamethasone and bone mineral density by means of computerized bone mineralometry-dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, endoscopic evaluation, and hematic morning cortisol determination were also performed. RESULTS: During treatment, the mean pCDAI significantly decreased (P < 0.05); 78% of patients discontinued steroids. Determination of morning cortisol showed suppression only on the first day after infusion, followed by normalization of values. Endoscopic findings showed remission in 44% of patients. None of the patients experienced serious side effects. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that repeated infusions of RBCs loaded with Dex 21-P can be safe and useful to maintain long-term remission in pediatric patients with moderately active CD.},

   abstract = {AIM: This study aimed to test the efficacy of mesalazine in maintaining remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) following successful flare-up treatment. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 122 patients received either mesalazine 50mg/kg per day (n=60) or placebo (n=62) for one year. Treatment allocation was stratified according to flare-up treatment (nutrition or medication alone). Recruitment was carried out over two periods, as the first period's results showed a trend favoring mesalazine. Relapse was defined as a Harvey-Bradshaw score more than or equal to 5. Time to relapse was analyzed using the Cox model. RESULTS: The one-year relapse rate was 57% (n=29) and 63% (n=35) in the mesalazine and placebo groups, respectively. We demonstrated a twofold lower relapse risk (P<0.02) in patients taking mesalazine in the medication stratum (first recruitment period), and a twofold higher risk in patients taking mesalazine in the nutrition stratum (second recruitment period), compared with the other groups. None of the children's characteristics, which differed across the two recruitment periods, accounted for the between-period variation in mesalazine efficacy. One serious adverse event was reported in each treatment group. CONCLUSION: Overall, mesalazine does not appear to be an effective maintenance treatment in pediatric CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association of genetic polymorphisms related to metabolism of homocysteine with inflammatory bowel disease has been evidenced in Crohn disease and remains an open question in ulcerative colitis. We evaluated the association of the polymorphisms of MTHFR, MTR, MTRR and TCN2 genes with ulcerative colitis in Central China. METHODS: 168 patients were genotyped for these polymorphisms and compared to 219 matched controls. RESULTS: Methionine synthase 2756G allele frequency was higher in ulcerative colitis than in controls 0.15 (95% C.I. 0.11-0.19) vs 0.09 (95% C.I. 0.07 - 0.12), (P = 0.0137) and predicted ulcerative colitis risk in logistic regression, with an Odds ratio at 1.8 (95% C.I. 1.15-2.84). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677TT genotype was 2.7-fold more prevalent in individuals with pancolitis than in those with left colitis or proctitis, with respective percentages of 27.3 (95% C.I.16.4-42.0) and 10.5 (95% C.I. 6.3-17.1) (P = 0.0123). The carriage of 677TT or 677CT/1298AC genotypes of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase was more frequent in cases with pancolitis than in subjects with left colitis or proctitis (P = 0.0048), with an Odds ratio adjusted by age and sex at 3.3 (95% C.I. 1.4-7.9), P = 0.0084) in logistic regression. CONCLUSION: Methionine synthase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase are genes of vitamin B12 and folate cellular metabolism associated respectively with risk and extent of ulcerative colitis, at least in Central China. This finding may open new insights, particularly for the potential interest in treating patients carrying the 677TT MTHFR genetic trait and a deficit in folate.},

AIM: To determine the frequency of osteoporosis and osteopenia of patients with CD and to study associated risk factors. METHODS: A forward-looking study was performed about 56 cases of CD, 34 men and 22 women, aged 32 + 10.4 years (18-54 years), with no other disorders affecting osseous metabolism. A biphotonic X-rays absorptiometry densitometry (DEXA) was performed at femoral neck and lumbar spine. A multivariate statistical analysis was performed to check for risk factors in osseous mineral density. RESULTS: Osteoporosis and osteopenia are noticed with respective frequency of 35.7 % and 23.2 %. A statistically significant association is found between low osseous density on one hand and physical mass index (IMC), localisation on large bowel of the disease and corticotherapy on the other hand. The IMC was a risk factor independent from the two other factors. Under nutrition, with IMC < 18 kg / m C, was observed at 21 patients. It was associated to a pathological densitometry in 76.2 % of cases, versus 48.6 % in patients having an IMC > 18 kg/m (p = 0.03, Odds ratio = 3.4). CONCLUSION: Among risk factors involved in the osteoporosis during CD, the nutritional status plays an important role which must be taken into account in the treatment of these patients.},

   abstract = {In order to increase dietary folic acid intake and to improve nutritional status regarding folate by controlling homocysteine concentrations, ten patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease in the colon and ulcerative colitis) received individualized nutritional guidance and were followed up as outpatients for 2 months. The following procedures were performed at the beginning of the study (T0), after 1 month (T1) and at the end of the study (T2): collection of anthropometric data (weight and height), dietary data (24 h diet recall), and blood under fasting condition for the determination of serum folic acid, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and vitamin B12. Plasma folic acid deficiency was not detected but hyperhomocysteinemia was present in six individuals and C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased (>0.5 mg/dl) in seven patients. After the patients were instructed there was a significant increase in vitamin B6 intake (about 35%) and in folate intake (49.6%). Mean plasma levels of folic acid, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 did not change, but there was a significant decrease of CRP at T1, 0.36 mg dl(-1) on average (P = 0.01), which was maintained at T2. We conclude that the increased folate intake reported by this group of patients was not reflected in improved serum concentrations of folic acid and homocysteine. However, the guidelines for the patients probably induced them to choose a more adequate diet, providing nutrients that help control the inflammatory process.},

In a retrospective cohort analysis of symptomatic pediatric patients with previously diagnosed IBD, we evaluated whether data from CE would result in the recognition of new disease locations that could alter the current diagnosis and provide information to better manage the underlying disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CE evaluation was performed in 28 patients an average of 4.2 +/- 3 years after original IBD diagnosis, and was prompted by exacerbation of underlying disease, growth failure/weight loss, or presurgical evaluation. Of the patients, 7 of 28 (25%) were originally diagnosed as having ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 5) or indeterminate colitis (IC) (n = 2), while 21 of 28 (75%) were diagnosed as having Crohn disease (CD). RESULTS: Following CE examination, 4 of 5 patients with UC and 1 of 2 patients with IC (total 5 of 7, 71% of UC/IC patients) had their disease reclassified to CD based upon newly diagnosed small bowel mucosal lesions. Moreover, 13 of 21 (62%) patients with CD were found at the time of CE examination to have more extensive small bowel disease with newly diagnosed jejunal disease found in 12 of 13 (92%) patients. In the 5 newly diagnosed patients with CD, all of them had therapeutic changes made. One capsule retention occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Capsule endoscopy may lead to reclassification of IBD from UC/ IC to definitive CD. In addition, previously diagnosed patients with CD may be found to have a more significant burden of small bowel disease. Taken together, this information may facilitate more targeted and effective therapies and potentially lead to better patient outcomes.},

   abstract = {According to Montreal classification, different phenotypes of Crohn's disease are defined taking into account age at diagnosis, localization of digestive lesions at first surgery, and cumulative anatomical behaviour. This classification is supported by the increased severity of the disease when diagnosed in childhood, the relative stability of disease localization over time, and the clinical importance of intestinal complications as stricture and abscess or fistula formation. However, type and delay of complications are dependent on disease localization (they develop early in small bowel disease and late in colitis), every patient will develop complications one day, and perianal disease may be an important problem observed in up to half the patients. The percentage of patients with active disease every year remains stable, about 40%, after the 3 first years, and only a few patients have long periods of remission. Intestinal resections are required in the majority of patients during life, and many are operated on several times. Prognosis is hampered by iterative surgery, cancer and side-effects of treatment. Standardized mortality ratio is 1.50. Although occurrence of complications, need for surgery and mortality did not change significantly through the years 1950-2000, there are some signals suggesting that new therapetic strategies (immunosuppressants earlier in high risk patients) and biologics will modify natural history and improve the long-term prognosis.},

   abstract = {Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor involved in intestinal lipid homeostasis and cell proliferation. Here we show that haploinsufficiency of LRH-1 predisposes mice to the development of intestinal inflammation. Besides the increased inflammatory response, LRH-1 heterozygous mice exposed to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid show lower local corticosterone production as a result of an impaired intestinal expression of the enzymes CYP11A1 and CYP11B1, which control the local synthesis of corticosterone in the intestine. Local glucocorticoid production is strictly enterocyte-dependent because it is robustly reduced in epithelium-specific LRH-1-deficient mice. Consistent with these findings, colon biopsies of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis show reduced expression of LRH-1 and genes involved in the production of glucocorticoids. Hence, LRH-1 regulates intestinal immunity in response to immunological stress by triggering local glucocorticoid production. These findings underscore the importance of LRH-1 in the control of intestinal inflammation and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: In human, citrulline (plasma concentration about 40 micromol/L) is an amino acid involved in intermediary metabolism and that is not incorporated in proteins. Circulating citrulline is mainly produced by enterocytes of the small bowel. For this reason plasma or serum citrulline concentration has been proposed as a biomarker of remnant small bowel mass and function. This article reviews this concept and its metabolic basis. METHODS: Conditions in which there is a significantly reduced small bowel enterocyte mass and function and a plasma or serum citrulline were measured in adults and children. These studies included patients with a short bowel syndrome, villous atrophy states, Crohn's disease, during monitoring of digestive toxicity of chemotherapy and radiotherapy or follow-up of patients after small bowel transplantation. RESULTS: In all these situations, with more than 500 studied patients a decreased level of plasma citrulline correlated with the reduced enterocyte mass independently of nutritional and inflammatory status. A close correlation between small bowel remnant length and citrullinemia was found. In addition, diagnosis of intestinal failure was assessed through plasma citrulline levels in severe small bowel diseases in which there is a marked enterocyte mass reduction. DISCUSSION: The threshold for establishing a diagnosis of intestinal failure is lower in villous atrophy disease (10mumol/L) than in short bowel syndrome (20mumol/L). Compromised renal function is an important factor when considering plasma citrulline levels as a marker of intestinal failure as this potentially can increase circulating citrulline values. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced plasma citrulline levels are an innovative quantitative biomarker of significantly reduced enterocyte mass and function in different disease states in humans.},

   abstract = {AIM: We investigated the contribution of variants of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and MDR1 genes in the predisposition and response to medical therapy in a large pediatric cohort of patients with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 200 patients with CD, 186 patients with UC, 434 parents (217 trios), and 347 healthy unrelated controls were investigated. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms -G308A and -C857T of the TNF-alpha gene and C3435T of the MDR1 gene were investigated and correlated with clinical subphenotypes and efficacy of medical therapy. RESULTS: The frequency of the -308A allele of the TNF-alpha gene was significantly increased in both patients with CD (15%; odds ratio [OR] = 2.79; P < 0.01) and patients with UC (11%; OR = 1.96; P < 0.003) compared with controls (6%). Carriers of this allele were 27% in CD (OR = 2.94; P < 0.01) and 19% in UC (OR = 1.86; P = 0.015) compared with 11% in healthy controls. No significant difference was found for both the -C857T and C3435T single-nucleotide polymorphisms. With the genotype/phenotype analysis, no correlation in patients with UC with the MDR1 gene was found. CD carriers of the -308A allele had a higher frequency of surgical resection (35% vs 20%; OR = 2.1; P = 0.035) and more frequent resistance to steroids (22% vs 8%; OR = 0.29; P = 0.032) compared with noncarriers. These findings were confirmed by stepwise logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: In our pediatric cohort, the promoter -308A polymorphism of TNF-alpha but not the MDR1 gene is significantly involved in the predisposition to both CD and UC. This polymorphism carries a significant reduction in response to steroid therapy, probably leading to a more frequent need for surgical resection.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lean body mass wastage in active Crohn's disease is not only related to malnutrition, but also to local and systemic inflammation. Altered bowel permeability can represent a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, that have been shown to produce muscle wastage by several mechanisms such as apoptosis. In our study we have evaluated the body composition and the pathological changes of skeletal muscle in patients with Crohn's disease to see whether a relationships between altered gut permeability, proinflammatory cytokines production and muscle wastage existed. METHODS: Thirteen consecutive steroid-free patients with active Crohn's disease underwent evaluation of body composition, sugar test for intestinal permeability, determination of serum levels of TNF-alpha, sphingosine, bacterial lipopolysaccaride, and biopsy of gastrocnemius. In bioptic samples we determined fibres cross sectional area, distribution of myosin heavy chains and apoptosis. Twenty healthy subjects formed the control group. RESULTS: In patients lean body mass was reduced and intestinal permeability increased (p<0.01 for both). TNFalpha, sphingosine and lipopolysaccaride were increased (p<0.01). Fibres size was reduced (p<0.01), with shift of Myosin Heavy Chains from the slow to the fast type. Apoptosis was found in 5 patients' biopsies, never in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's patients have a myopathy characterized by myocyte apoptosis, modifications of myosin and muscle atrophy. TNF-alpha and sphingosine, that are increased because of the enhanced lipopolysaccaride concentration due to altered gut permeability, may play a pathophysiological role in the development of this myopathy.},

We hypothesized that anti-OmpC, in the absence of anti-S cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), is an assay that overestimates the presence of Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of patients evaluated at our institution between January 2002 and June 2006 revealed that 170 had serodiagnostic immunological assays performed as part of an evaluation for possible IBD. The assays were screened for a pattern in which anti-OmpC was present in the absence of ASCA and ANCA. RESULTS: Seven patients between 3 and 20 years of age were discovered to be positive for anti-OmpC but negative for ASCA and ANCA. These patients were determined to have significant medical conditions without combined radiographic, endoscopic, or histological evidence of IBD. Despite the reported 85% positive predictive value of anti-OmpC for IBD, none of the 7 patients with isolated anti-OmpC had a diagnosis of CD or UC. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-OmpC, in the absence of ASCA and ANCA, is a serological pattern noted in a subset of medically complex cases in children and young adults without CD or UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: At least 25% of individuals diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) have onset of disease in childhood. Almost all children with CD have nutritional impairments, such as weight loss or stunting, at diagnosis or subsequently. Nutritional therapy (exclusive enteral nutrition) is established as a valid and effective treatment in paediatric CD. The advantages of this approach are induction of remission and control of inflammatory changes, mucosal healing, positive benefits to growth and overall nutritional status, and avoidance of other medical therapies. AIM: To provide a comprehensive up-to-date review of the roles of nutritional therapy in CD and of the data supporting this therapy. METHODS: A search of PubMed was performed with search terms 'enteral nutrition', 'nutritional therapy', 'Crohn disease' and 'children'. Relevant articles were selected from this search. In addition, the reference lists of available articles were reviewed for further relevant articles. RESULTS: Nutritional therapy offers numerous benefits in the management of CD. Recent work has begun to elucidate the likely mechanisms of this therapy. These include direct mucosal anti-inflammatory effects and alteration of intestinal microflora. CONCLUSION: Further studies are required to define longer-term effects of nutritional therapy in patients with CD.},

We investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of PF in an in vitro model of epithelial cell inflammation. PF did not affect cell viability over a range of dilutions, but when PF was added to the culture medium the interleukin (IL)-8 response to proinflammatory stimuli was significantly reduced. This effect was due to PF acting directly on the cells as the IL-8 response was still reduced when PF was separated from the proinflammatory stimuli in a 2-compartment system. In the presence of PF, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB nuclear migration was not inhibited; however, IkappaBalpha degradation was delayed. PF has direct anti-inflammatory effects upon immortalized colonic enterocytes. Therefore PF may, in part, modulate gut inflammation by directly reducing the inflammatory response of the intestinal epithelium.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Granulomas are pathognomonic findings of Crohn disease (CD); however, their occurrence and clinical significance are not well characterized. Our aim was to determine the frequency and distribution of granulomas in untreated and treated patients with CD and their relation to age and disease severity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records from patients with CD undergoing colonoscopy with terminal ileum biopsy over 7 years were reviewed. Clinical information and laboratory, pathology, and radiology results were recorded. The frequency and distribution of granulomas were determined. RESULTS: From 376 patients with CD, 75% underwent concurrent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. Of those, 65% (184/282) were untreated. Granulomas were identified in 48% (136/282) of all patients and in 61% (112/184) of untreated patients and 24.5% (24/98) of treated patients (P < 0.0005). The upper tract and terminal ileum biopsies were essential to the identification of 42% of patients with granulomas. The presence of granulomas at diagnosis was related to anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies, hypoalbuminemia, perianal disease, and gastritis at presentation (P = 0.03, P = 0.008, P = 0.03, and P = 0.001), respectively, and to perianal disease and infliximab treatment at the latest visit (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01), respectively. Granulomas were not related to age, sex, ethnicity, weight and height z scores, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CARD15/NOD2 mutations, abdominal surgery, or stricturing or fistulizing disease. CONCLUSIONS: Granulomas were identified in 61% of fully investigated pediatric patients with CD at diagnosis, including a substantial proportion of patients in whom colonoscopy to the cecum would have been insufficient for diagnosis. Granulomas were more frequent in untreated patients (P < 0.0005), and their prevalence was not affected by age. The presence of granulomas at diagnosis was associated with perianal disease, gastritis, hypoalbuminemia, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies, and infliximab treatment.},

   abstract = {Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody (75% human, 25% murine) against tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a cytokine with a central role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Large randomized controlled trials have shown the efficacy and safety of infliximab for the induction and maintenance of remission in adult patients with active Crohn disease (CD). In children and adolescents, mostly small, nonrandomized, non-placebo-controlled studies have supported the notion that infliximab is a potent drug in a population that does not respond to standard therapies. The safety of infliximab is of major concern, and the most frequent severe adverse events are related to severe infections and reactivation of tuberculosis. Non-life-threatening infusion reactions occur rather frequently and seem to be related to the formation of antibodies. The indications for infliximab treatment are therapy-resistant luminal CD (no efficacy or insufficient efficacy of conventional treatment) and therapy-resistant fistulas. An efficient remission induction strategy consists of 3 initial infliximab infusions at 0, 2, and 6 weeks in a dosage of 5 mg/kg to sustain remission. Patients needing maintenance therapy are subsequently treated with an infliximab infusion every 8 weeks. There are indications that the early stages of CD may be more susceptible to immunomodulation, and the natural history of CD may be altered by the introduction of infliximab early in the disease process instead of waiting until conventional therapy has failed. Major points of discussion are whether infliximab maintenance treatment should be episodic (on demand) or scheduled and when infliximab therapy can be discontinued.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Enteral nutrition is a widely used therapy for nutritional treatment of patients with multiple pathologies. The present review selects important evidenced-based papers from 2006 and 2007 and critically reviews them for the reader. RECENT FINDINGS: Use of synbiotics and probiotics is gaining acceptance. Supplements such as glutamine may be important for wound healing. Enteral feeding in malnourished patients may result in rapid growth of gut mucosal protein. Antibiotics are important for reduction of postpercutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy infections. Early enteral nutrition in burn patients blunts the hypermetabolic response. Polymeric enteral formulations in vitro have a direct anti-inflammatory effect on enterocytes. Enteral nutrition, however, does not appear better than steroid use for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Long-term (12-week) infusion of immune-enhancing enteral formulas in a nonsurgical patient group is well tolerated and safe. Finally, large reviews of enteral nutrition and their efficacy for specific disease states continue to demonstrate the difficulty in interpreting multiple small clinical studies. SUMMARY: Enteral nutrition continues as a highly used medical therapy, usually as an adjuvant for other pharmacologic and supportive therapies. Multiple small clinical trials, observational studies and retrospective reviews must be analyzed to develop 'best practice' guidelines with enteral nutrition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: TNFalpha seems to contribute to inflammation and malnutrition in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. In CD patients, the comparative effects on nutritional status of infliximab and traditional therapy have not yet been determined. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of infliximab as compared with those of standard therapy on nutritional status, disease activity, resting energy expenditure (REE), and food intake in CD children and adolescents. METHODS: From September 1999 to September 2005, all CD patients treated with infliximab (group A) were reviewed and matched with CD patients treated with traditional therapy (mesalazine and azathioprine) (group B). RESULTS: Fourteen CD patients from group A and 14 from group B were included; median interval before follow-up investigation was 10 months. Baseline and final values of weight, height, body mass index (BMI), pediatric CD activity index (pCDAI), REE, and food intake were studied. In treated patients, but not in control group, mean baseline weight (kg) and BMI values, 39.7 +/- 13.1 and 17.9 +/- 3.3, respectively, were significantly lower than their final values 42.6 +/- 13.2 and 18.9 +/- 3.1, and median pCDAI values 23.5 were significantly higher than their final values 10 (P < 0.05). Significant changes in height, REE, and food intake were not found in either group. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric CD patients, infliximab seems to impact positively on the nutritional status as demonstrated by the improvement in weight and BMI, but not in linear growth; effects on nutritional status seem to be due to amelioration of disease activity, rather than to REE reduction or food intake increase.},

Recognition of this entity is highly relevant to avoid malnutrition-related morbidity and mortality. Therapy for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is based on the oral administration of pancreatic enzymes aiming at providing the duodenal lumen with sufficient active lipase at the time of gastric emptying of nutrients. Administration of enzymes in the form of enteric-coated minimicrospheres avoids acid-mediated lipase inactivation and ensures gastric emptying of enzymes in parallel with nutrients. Nevertheless, such factors as acidic intestinal pH and bacterial overgrowth may prevent normalization of fat digestion even in compliant patients. The present article critically reviews current therapeutic approaches to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some dietary foods are considered protective (vegetables and fruits), whereas others (fatty foods) are thought to enhance the risk for Crohn's disease (CD). The evidence, however, is inconsistent. METHODS: We postulated that specific dietary patterns may influence the risk for CD. A case-control study was carried out. Newly diagnosed CD cases with population and/or hospital-based controls < or =20 years were selected from 3 tertiary hospitals across Canada. Pre-disease diet was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) administered within 1 month of diagnosis. Factor analyses and unconditional logistic regression (adjusted) was used to determine gender-specific dietary patterns and assess associated risks for CD. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: A total of 149 cases and 251 controls were included. The mean age (range) of the cases was 13.3 (2.6-20 years). There were more boys (61.1%). Four dietary patterns each were observed among both boys and girls. Pattern 1 in girls, characterized by meats, fatty foods, and desserts, was positively associated with CD (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.6-14.2). Pattern 2, common to both boys and girls, was characterized by vegetables, fruits, olive oil, fish, grains, and nuts and was inversely associated with CD in both genders (girls: OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9; boys: OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that specific dietary patterns could be associated with higher or lower risks for CD in children. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the precision of published prediction equations for fat-free mass (FFM) from bioimpedance measurements in children with Crohn disease using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as an in vivo gold standard. METHODS: Fat-free mass of 49 white boys and girls ages 7.3 to 16.9 y suffering from Crohn disease was measured by DXA. Body weight, height and bioimpedance measurements were also collected. FFM measured by DXA (FFM(DXA)) was compared with FFM predicted by the only 5 published prediction equations available for children and adolescents. An equation was developed for predicting FFM and was validated using a bootstrap method. RESULTS: When correlating predicted FFM with FFM(DXA), Schaefer's equation showed the highest R2 (0.950), the smallest standard error of estimate (SEE) (2.05 kg) and the smallest percentage error (0.28%). Our prediction equation for estimating FFM was FFM = 0.652 Ht2/Z + 0.0385 Wt + 0.586 Age - 0.327, R2 = 0.951, SEE = 2.08, P < 0.0005, where Ht2/Z is the impedance index in cm2/ohm, Wt is body weight in kilograms, age is in years. R2 value from bootstrap method was 0.950 +/- 0.01 (95% confidence interval 0.927-0.968), indicating an acceptable validation of the derived formula. CONCLUSIONS: The formula of Schaefer is the best for predicting FFM. The present study provides a new prediction equation for estimating FFM in children with Crohn disease that may be used in clinical settings in which more sophisticated body composition measuring equipments are not available.},

AIM: To review and update evidence on the effectiveness of enteral nutrition (EN) in treating active Crohn's disease in children. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library (up to February 2007) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) relevant to Crohn's disease and EN in children. RESULTS: We included 11 RCTs (n = 394). Seven RCTs (n = 204) compared EN with corticosteroid therapy. On the basis of pooled results of four RCTs (n = 144), we found no significant difference in the remission rates between groups (relative risk, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.7-1.4, random effect model). Four RCTs (n = 190) compared two EN regimens. One of the four RCTs (n = 50) revealed a significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving remission in the total EN group compared with the partial EN group (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1-7.4). Because of lack of data, formal pooling of results was not possible for many outcomes (e.g., time until remission, duration of remission, growth data). CONCLUSIONS: Limited data suggest similar efficacy for EN and corticosteroids. As the number of patients needed to provide a definite answer is too large, future studies should focus on detailed outcome measurements including growth and quality of life.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: From the epidemiological point of view, Lesniowski-Crohn's disease (CD) has become an important medical problem. It is essential to differentiate CD from functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, first of all, from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). There are no simple, non-invasive tests available which could help to identify patients with common symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea who should be referred for further evaluation, including endoscopy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of the assessment of fecal calprotectin concentration in patients with CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Stool samples were taken from 31 patients of the Gastroenterology, Human Nutrition and Internal Diseases Department of Poznan Medical University who were diagnosed with CD. Patients suffering from IBS served as the control group. Calprotectin concentration was assessed by means of the immunoenzymatic ELISA method. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration and blood cell count were determined. The clinical activity of CD was assessed by means of Crohn's Disease Activity Index. An appropriate statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Mean calprotectin concentration in CD group was 32.01 +/- 22.58 mg/l and it was statistically higher (p <0.0003) than among IBS patients. A concentration of 16.01 mg/l had 67.7% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity in distinguishing between CD and IBS. There was a positive correlation between calprotectin concentration and CRP, and negative--with hemoglobin concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of fecal calprotectin concentration may be useful in differential diagnoses of CD and monitoring patients with CD.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 10-year retrospective review was undertaken of the medical records of 245 pediatric patients with IBD studied at a tertiary care center. RESULTS: In this patient population 24% were black and 76% were white. There were no differences between black and white patients in terms of anatomic distribution of IBD, symptom presentation, and extraintestinal manifestations. A family history of IBD (36.4% vs 17.5%; P = 0.006) was more common in white children. Mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate of black patients with Crohn disease was higher at diagnosis compared with whites (P < 0.001) and a greater proportion of African Americans presented with a body mass index z-score less than -2 (P < 0.009). At 12 months following diagnosis 22.5% of African American children had a hemoglobin level lower than 10 g/dL compared with 4.3% of whites (P = 0.001). African Americans had evidence of more complicating stricturing and penetrating Crohn disease behavior (51.3% vs 27.4%; P = 0.006). African Americans received significantly more corticosteroids and infliximab to treat their IBD compared with whites (P < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that for pediatric IBD, there may be racial differences in prevalence of family history and in disease phenotype.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human Paneth cell alpha-defensins, especially DEFA5, are involved in maintaining homeostasis of the human microbial microflora. Since breakdown of normal mucosal antibacterial defence occurs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), variants in the DEFA5 gene could be associated with IBD risk. SUBJECTS: A cohort of 25 patients with indeterminate colitis (IC), 405 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 385 with Crohn's disease (CD), were compared with 201 control individuals from the Canterbury region in New Zealand. METHODS: A 15 kb haplotype block surrounding DEFA5 contained 35 HapMap markers which were polymorphic in Caucasians. Four markers (A-D) were selected to tag 27 of the 35 markers at r(2)>0.68, and were genotyped in DNA samples. RESULTS: Minor allele frequencies for all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were somewhat elevated in patients. Subgroup analysis showed SNP A had odds ratio 1.44 in UC patients with pancolitis (95% C.I. 1.07-1.94), SNP B odds ratio 2.37 in CD patients with onset prior to 17 years age (95% C.I. 1.12-5.03), SNP C odds ratio 1.68 in UC patients with left colonic localisation (95% C.I. 1.12-2.52), and SNP D had odds ratio 1.56 in CD patients with one or more relatives with IBD (95% C.I. 1.03-2.35). Two two-marker haplotypes and one three-marker haplotype were associated with UC (p-values 0.025-0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The SNPs genotyped in our study were surrogates for common variants, and observed associations between these and IBD status are likely due to linkage disequilibrium with a functional common DEFA5 variant. Identifying such functional variants will be prioritized in subsequent work.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the role that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter of the tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene play in the risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in a New Zealand population, in the context of international studies. METHODS: DNA samples from 388 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 405 ulcerative colitis (UC), 27 indeterminate colitis (IC) and 201 randomly selected controls, from Canterbury, New Zealand were screened for 3 common polymorphisms in the TNF-alpha receptor: -238 G-->A, -308 G-->A and -857C-->T, using a Taqman assay. A meta-analysis was performed on the data obtained on these polymorphisms combined with that from other published studies. RESULTS: Individuals carrying the -308 G/A allele had a significantly (OR = 1.91, c2 = 17.36, P < 0.0001) increased risk of pancolitis, and a 1.57-fold increased risk (OR = 1.57, c2 = 4.34, P = 0.037) of requiring a bowel resection in UC. Carrying the -857 C/T variant decreased the risk of ileocolonic CD (OR = 0.56, c2 = 4.32, P = 0.037), and the need for a bowel resection (OR = 0.59, c2 = 4.85, P = 0.028). The risk of UC was reduced in individuals who were smokers at diagnosis, (OR = 0.48, c2 = 4.86, P = 0.028). CONCLUSION: TNF-alpha is a key cytokine known to play a role in inflammatory response, and the locus for the gene is found in the IBD3 region on chromosome 6p21, known to be associated with an increased risk for IBD. The -308 G/A SNP in the TNF-alpha promoter is functional, and may account in part for the increased UC risk associated with the IBD3 genomic region. The -857 C/T SNP may decrease IBD risk in certain groups. Pharmaco- or nutrigenomic approaches may be desirable for individuals with such affected genotypes.},

   abstract = {Nutrigenomics has the potential to tailor diets to optimize health, based on knowledge of key genetic polymorphisms. Identification of candidate genes is often based on a priori knowledge of disease processes. However, genome-wide association methods are not only validating previously identified genes and polymorphisms, but also revealing new gene-disease associations not anticipated from prior knowledge. In Crohn's disease (CD), such studies not only confirm the importance of caspase-activated recruitment domain 15 and major histocompatibility complex II molecules, but also reveal strong associations with the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-23 receptor and autophagy-related 16-like gene. Genes identified to date in CD can be linked into two interrelated pathways: receptor-mediated cytokine induction or autophagocytosis. New genomic technologies need to be matched with innovative methodologies to characterize the likely impact of foods and to take the field to another dimension of value for human diet development and optimized health.},

In this cross-sectional study thirty patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), twenty-one with Crohn disease (CD) and twenty-four controls were investigated (mean age: UC, 40.8 (sd 12.1); CD, 37.6 (sd 11.0); control, 31.5 (sd 8.4) years). Fatty acid composition of plasma lipids was determined by high-resolution capillary GLC. In plasma phospholipids, significantly higher values of eicosapentaenoic (20 : 5n-3), docosapentaenoic (22 : 5n-3) and gamma-linolenic (18 : 3n-6) acids were found in control patients and patients with UC as compared to patients with CD [median % (weight by weight), control v. UC v. CD : 20 : 5n-3, 0.09 (interquartile range (IQR) 0.05) v. 0.14 (IQR 0.10) v. 0.16 (IQR 0.10), P < 0.05; 22 : 5n-3, 0.14 (IQR 0.10) v. 0.27 (IQR 0.16) v. 0.31 (IQR 0.10), P < 0.001; 18 : 3n-6, 0.02 (IQR 0.02) v. 0.03 (IQR 0.02) v. 0.05 (IQR 0.03), P < 0.05]. When compared to the control, values of the principal n-3 and n-6 long-chain PUFA, arachidonic acid (20 : 4n-6) and DHA (22 : 6n-3) were significantly higher in patients with UC but not in patients with CD [median % (w/w), UC v. control: 20 : 4n-6, 8.43 (IQR 3.23) v. 6.92 (IQR 2.96), P < 0.05; 22 : 6n-3, 1.22 (IQR 0.56) v. 0.73 (IQR 0.39), P < 0.05]. As seen there are considerable differences between the long-chain PUFA status of patients suffering from UC or CD. The data obtained in the present study do not support the concept of eicosapentaenoic acid or DHA deficiency in patients with either UC or CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase regulates cell growth, survival, and differentiation in several tissues, but its role in the gastrointestinal tract has not been reported. We tested the hypothesis that ErbB4 promotes intestinal cell survival and restitution following injury or inflammation. METHODS: ErbB4 expression in human inflammatory bowel disease was determined by immunohistochemistry. Mice were subjected to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 3%) colitis or injected with tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and ErbB4 expression was quantified by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Cultured young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells were exposed to TNF, and ErbB4 messenger RNA, protein, and phosphorylation levels were measured. Cells transfected with ErbB4 small interfering RNA (siRNA), or over expressing ErbB4, were subjected to wound healing and apoptosis assays. RESULTS: ErbB4 levels increased in Crohn's colitis and the colon epithelium of mice with DSS colitis or injected with TNF. In YAMC cells, TNF induced ErbB4 messenger RNA, protein, and phosphorylation; nuclear factor kappaB activation also stimulated ErbB4 accumulation. ErbB4 siRNA sensitized cells to TNF-stimulated apoptosis, while over expression blocked apoptosis induced by TNF plus cycloheximide. Additionally, ErbB4 siRNA decreased YAMC cell wound healing. ErbB4 knockdown attenuated, while over expression elevated, phosphorylation of Akt in response to TNF. Inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling cascade reversed the ability of ErbB4 over expression to protect from cytokine-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: ErbB4 expression and signaling are key elements for TNF responses in vivo and in cell culture, protecting intestinal epithelial cells from apoptosis in the inflammatory environment, possibly through Akt activation.},

   abstract = {The colonic epithelium is lined along its apical membrane with approximately 10(14) bacteria/g of tissue. Commensal bacteria outnumber mammalian cells in the gut severalfold. The reason for this degree of commensalism probably resides in the recent recognition of the microbiome as an important source of metabolic energy in the setting of poorly digestible nutrients. As in many themes in biology, the host may have sacrificed short-term benefit, i.e. nutritional advantages, for long-term consequences, such as chronic inflammation or colon cancer. In the present review, we examine the role of TLR (Toll-like receptor) signalling in the healthy host and the diseased host. We pay particular attention to the role of TLR signalling in idiopathic IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and colitis-associated carcinogenesis. In general, TLR signalling in health contributes to homoeostatic functions. These include induction of antimicrobial peptides, proliferation and wound healing in the intestine. The pathogenesis of IBD, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease may be due to increased TLR or decreased TLR signalling respectively. Finally, we discuss the possible role of TLR signalling in colitis-associated neoplasia.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Anal fistulas are common in individuals with Crohn's disease (CD). We sought to evaluate the efficacy of oral spherical adsorptive carbon (AST-120) (Kremezin; Kureha Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) for the treatment of intractable anal fistulas in patients with CD. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with CD and at least one active anal fistula under treatment were assigned to receive either AST-120 or placebo for 8 wk. Improvement was defined as a reduction of 50% or more from baseline in the number of draining fistulas observed at both 4 and 8 wk. Remission was defined by closure of all draining fistulas at both 4 and 8 wk. The Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) were also assessed. RESULTS: In total, 62 patients were randomized, of whom 57 received AST-120 (N = 27) or placebo (N = 30). The improvement rate in the AST-120 group (37.0%) was significantly greater than that in the placebo group (10.0%) (P= 0.025). The corresponding remission rates were 29.6% and 6.7%, respectively (P= 0.035). PDAI significantly improved at both 4 and 8 wk with AST-120, compared to placebo (P= 0.004 and P= 0.005, respectively). CDAI was also significantly improved at both 4 and 8 wk in the AST-120 group, compared to the placebo group (P= 0.007 and P= 0.001, respectively). AST-120 treatment was well tolerated and no life-threatening adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION: AST-120 is useful for the control of intractable anal fistulas in CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are often under nourished. Though there are several studies evaluating nutrition in patients with IBD from the developed world, the data from developing countries are scanty, where under nutrition is predominant. METHOD: 62 patients with IBD (55 ulcerative colitis [UC] and 7 Crohn's disease [CD] patients) and 42 healthy subjects (HS) were evaluated for nutrition using dietary survey, anthropometric and biochemical parameters. RESULTS: Of the patients with IBD, 23 (37%) had active disease and 39 (63%) were in remission. Daily intake of calories (1725 Kcal/d [500-2458] vs. 2239 Kcal/d [1835-3000], p<0.0001), protein (40 g/d [19-96] vs. 50 g/d [29-73], p=0.001) and iron (9 mg/d [1-16] vs. 12 mg/d [9-16], p<0.0001) and anthropometric parameters of nutrition such as body mass index (BMI) (19.8 [13.7-27.5] vs. 23 [17.9-27.2], <0.0001), biceps (0.3 mm [0.1-1.9] vs. 0.5 mm [0.2-1.0], p<0.0001) and triceps (0.7 mm [0.2-2.9] vs. 1.2 mm [0.5-2.3], p<0.0001) skin fold thickness (BSF, TSF) and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC, 25.9 mm [15-35] vs. 26.8 mm [23-32] <0.04) were lower among the IBD patients than among the HS. Though patients with CD had a lower level of haemoglobin (median 9.2 g vs. 10.8 g, respectively; p<0.05) and serum total protein (median 6 g, range 3-7 vs. 7 g, range 3-9, respectively; p<0.05), serum albumin, BMI, BSF and TSF thicknesses, MAMC and daily intake of protein, calories, calcium and iron were comparable between UC and CD patients. Though daily dietary intake was comparable between patients with active disease and those in remission yet patients with active disease had lower BMI, MAMC and serum protein level. CONCLUSION: Under nutrition is common in patients with IBD, particularly in those with acute exacerbation.},

In particular, n-3 fatty acids may be of therapeutic value for some Crohn's disease patients who experience Ca malabsorption. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of 20 : 5n-3 and 22 : 6n-3 on transepithelial Ca transport across monolayers of healthy Caco-2 cells as well as of TNF-alpha-treated Caco-2 cells (an in vitro model of Crohn's disease). Caco-2 cells were seeded onto permeable filter supports and allowed to differentiate into monolayers, which were treated with 80 microM-20 : 5n-3, 80 microM-22 : 6n-3, or 40 microM-20 : 5n-3 + 40 microM-22 : 6n-3 for 6 or 8 d, with or without co-treatment with TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml) (n 11-15 monolayers per treatment). On day 16, transepithelial and transcellular transport of 45Ca and fluorescein transport (a marker of paracellular diffusion) were measured. Treatment of healthy and inflamed Caco-2 cells with 20 : 5n-3, 22 : 6n-3 and both fatty acids combined for 8 d significantly (P < 0.005-0.01) increased total transepithelial Ca transport compared with that in control, effects which were mediated by an enhanced rate of transcellular Ca transport. The effects of n-3 fatty acids on Ca absorption after 6 d were less clear-cut. In conclusion, the present in vitro findings highlight the need to investigate the effect of marine oil-based n-3 fatty acids on Ca absorption in vivo in studies of healthy human subjects as well as of Crohn's disease patients.},

The discovery of living leukocytes in human milk in 1970 was the final link to the chain of evidence that culminated in the concept. The concept was later expanded to include not only antimicrobial but also anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory agents. These agents evolved to compensate for developmental delays in the immune system during infancy. Indeed, that explains the defense by human milk against common infectious diseases in infancy, necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants, and immune-mediated disorders such as Crohn's disease in later childhood. These diverse evolutionary outcomes underscore the superiority of human milk for the nutrition of human infants. Finally, other components of the immune system in human milk and their fate and functions in the developing infant may well be discovered in the near future.},

Care for patients with HPN is provided at centres other than designated intestinal failure units in the UK, but there are few data on outcomes. AIM: To audit the standard of care at one such centre using objective measures to compare with results published from other centres and intestinal failure units. DESIGN: 15-year retrospective audit of paper and computer-based records of all HPN patients (1990-2004). METHODS: Demographic data, major line and metabolic complication rates and mortality were collected and analysed. RESULTS: 88 patients received HPN for a total period of 121 patient-years (median duration 217.8 days, range 18.3-3881.2, median age 40, range 3-73). Principal reasons for HPN were Crohns' disease (35.2%), mesenteric, infarction (11.4%), surgical complications (17.0%), intestinal motility disorder (10.7%). The frequency of major complications were line sepsis (0.35 episodes/patient-year), line occlusion (0.25 episodes/patient-year), subacute bacterial endocarditis (0.02 episodes/patient-year), cholestasis (0.17 episodes/patient-year) and central venous thrombosis (0.03 episodes/patient-year). Indications and complications were all within the range of published data. CONCLUSION: HPN can be delivered effectively outside designated intestinal failure units and the current data are representative of a standard of care.},

   abstract = {Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are exposed to nutritional risk. Malnutrition in Crohn's Disease (CD) and to a somewhat lesser in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is very frequent. Depending on the severity of the disease, weight loss has been reported in 65% to 76% of those with CD and in 18% to 62% of those with UC. The role of Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is essential in very severe cases where enteral nutrition is not tolerated or standard drug therapy is not effective. Nutritional therapy is important for the correction of nutritional deficiency, especially in cases where elective surgical treatment is required. This study examined the effects of preoperative TPN administration in patients with IBD. Since 1990, 29 pts, 13 (44.8%) male and 16 (55.2%) female with severe IBD; 16 (55.2%) with UC and 13 (44.8%) with CD were treated with TPN in our department in the preoperative period. Evaluation of this group was compared with a group which was not treated with TPN preoperatively: 61 pts, 34 (55.7%) male, 27 (44.3%) female; 50 (82%) with CD, 11 (18%) with UC. Evaluation of this group was compared with the group of patients who were subjected to surgical procedure without prior TPN administration, in total a number of 61, of whom 34 (55.7%) were male and 27 (44.3%) female patients. In this group, the number of patients with CD and UC was 50 (82%) and 11(18%) respectively. During the course of the study, the following parameters were examined: Body mass index (BMI), Disease Activity Index (CDAI/AI), laboratory parameters and the number of hospital days. The parameters were analysed before the surgical intervention, and one week and six months after the surgical intervention. The duration of the application of TPN was 12.5 +/- 5 days. The analysis of these parameters has shown that there is no statistically significant difference in the number of hospital days in both groups, which was 18.9 +/- 8.9 in the intervention group and 18.9 +/- 6.5 days in the control group, p = 0.9808, but analysis of the Disease Activity (CDAI/AI) has shown that patients who were on TPN were in a more severe stage of the disease. In the TPN treated group of patients none, 0 pts (0%), of the pts had no Index of Activity, 1.7 pts (24.1%) had Index 2 and 22 (75.9%) had Index 3. In the other group 3 pts (4.9%) had Index 1; 39 pts (63.9%) had Index 2 and 19 pts (31.2%) had Index of Activity 3. During the monitoring period of six months the activity of the disease was lower in patients treated with TPN. The BMI in the group of patients treated with TPN was lower in both sexes. It was lower than 18.4 in 7 males and 5 females; between 18.4 and 19.9 in 2 males and 4 females; between 19.9 and 25 in 3 males and 6 females; between 25 and 19.9 in 1 male and 1 female; there were no pts with BMI higher than 29.9. In the control non-TPN group, 5 males and 3 females had BMI < or = 18.4; 2 males and 5 females had between 18.4 and 19.9; 23 males and 13 females had between 19.9 and 25; 3 males and 5 females had between 25 and 29.9 and 1 male and 1 female had BMI higher than 29.9. The BMI had an increasing trend in the postoperative period in both groups. The laboratory parameters that we examined were: number of erythrocytes and sedimentation, number of leukocytes, haemoglobin levels, total number of lymphocytes, albumin level, C-reactive protein, orosomucoid, electrolytes; sodium, potassium, calcium and serum iron, the enzymes (AP, AST and ALT); level of bilirubin and urea and creatinine. The results were analysed using the Tukey honest significant difference test (HSD), ANOVA and Student t-test. Statistically significant differences were observed between preoperative and postoperative period in both groups. The intergroup comparison showed significant differences in the level of albumin, AST, ALT and bilirubin.},

Medical treatment must be optimized to promote clinical improvement and reverse growth failure with minimal toxicity. In addition to pharmacologic and surgical interventions, nutritional therapies play a vital role in the management of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. This review will outline the epidemiology and clinical complications that are unique to pediatric inflammatory bowel disease, current trends, and recent advances in nutritional and pharmacologic treatment, and projected future therapeutic direction.},

The information currently available does not provide an exact explanation about the origin of this important dysfunction of the interaction between host and commensal bacteria, but an altered microbial composition has been detected in the gut ecosystem of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Prebiotics are food ingredients not digested nor absorbed in the upper intestinal tract that are fermented by intestinal bacteria in a selective way promoting changes in the gut ecosystem. Experimental and human studies have shown that inulin and oligofructose stimulate saccharolysis in the colonic lumen and favour the growth of indigenous lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with reduced mucosal inflammation in animal models of IBD. Strong experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that inulin and oligofructose can offer an opportunity to prevent or mitigate intestinal inflammatory lesions in human Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis. Encouraging results have been obtained in preliminary clinical trials.},

In this study, the proteomic responses of the two distinct strains of M. a. paratuberculosis, cattle (C) and sheep (S), to hypoxia and starvation were studied in vitro. Nutrient starvation inhibited growth of both strains and was lethal for S strain after 12 weeks. Hypoxia induced a state of very low metabolic activity but rapid resuscitation occurred upon restoration of an aerobic atmosphere, consistent with the dormancy response of other mycobacteria. A total of 55 protein spots differentially expressed in response to starvation and/or hypoxic stress in one or both strains were identified from 2D gels and classified based on biological function. Antioxidant enzymes, oxidoreducatse enzymes and proteins involved in amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, ATP and purine biosynthesis, proteolysis, cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, signal recognition and hypothetical proteins with putative functions including dormancy response regulators and universal stress proteins were identified. These proteins are potential screening targets for future diagnosis, prevention and control of M. a. paratuberculosis infection and their identification will assist understanding the pathogenesis of diseases caused by this organism.},

Genetic susceptibility factors tend to be common, whereas complicating environmental factors such as cigarette smoking are generally not an issue. As opposed to the case in adult patients, Crohn's disease is usually diagnosed in children at an early, inflammatory phase of the disease. Pediatric ulcerative colitis tends to present with more severe and more extensive involvement than in adults. In both forms of IBD, the severity of disease activity often dictates the need for early aggressive nutritional, immunomodulatory, and biologic therapy. As a result, the lessons learned from the evaluation and treatment of children with IBD are critically important to the clinician caring for adults with the same disorders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Genetic variations that affect innate immunity increase risk of ileal Crohn's disease (CD). However, the penetrance of susceptibility genes, including NOD2, is low, suggesting additional risk factors. Neutralizing autoantibodies (Ab) against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF Ab) reduce neutrophil antimicrobial function in patients with primary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). We investigated whether GM-CSF Ab regulates neutrophil function in CD. METHODS: Serum samples from 354 adult and pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were analyzed for GM-CSF Ab and IBD markers. Levels of GM-CSF Ab were compared with patients' CD features and neutrophil function. Intestinal barrier function and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced injury were assessed in GM-CSF-null and NOD2-null mice. RESULTS: Median GM-CSF Ab levels increased from 0.4 microg/mL in control serum to 2.4 microg/mL in pediatric CD and 11.7 microg/mL in adult CD serum and were associated with ileal involvement (P<.001). Ileal location, duration of disease, and increased GM-CSF Ab levels were associated with stricturing/penetrating behavior (odds ratio, 2.2; P=.018). The positive and negative predictive values of GM-CSF Ab for stricturing/penetrating behavior were comparable with that of other IBD serum markers. CD patients with increased GM-CSF Ab had reduced neutrophil phagocytic capacity and increased accumulation of pSTAT3+ neutrophils in the affected ileum. GM-CSF-null mice and NOD2-null mice in which GM-CSF was neutralized had defects in mucosal barrier function and developed a transmural ileitis following NSAID exposure. CONCLUSIONS: GM-CSF regulates ileal homeostasis in CD and in mouse models. CD patients with increases in serum GM-CSF Ab might benefit from GM-CSF administration.},

   abstract = {The current Crohn's disease treatment algorithm involves a "step-up" approach in which conventional medications such as corticosteroids are given first and anti-tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) agents are reserved for refractory cases. Although this approach may seem to be cost-efficient, recent studies have shown that "top-down" therapy using anti-TNF-a agents in newly diagnosed patients improves long-term rates of mucosal healing, a therapeutic endpoint that correlates with reduced hospitalizations and surgeries, thereby reducing overall costs and enhancing patients' quality of life. Another reason the step-up approach has been favored over the top-down is concern about side effects; however, a multivariate logistic regression analysis of patients treated with or without infliximab showed no differences in mortality, serious infections, or malignancies between the 2 groups. Moreover, newer anti-TNF-a agents, such as adalimumab and certolizumab pegol, have the potential to reduce the risk of immunogenicity and the associated infusion reactions and loss of response, as well as reducing autoimmunity associated with infliximab therapy. The potential advantages of "reversing" our current therapeutic pyramid/algorithm for the treatment of Crohn's disease include early disease stabilization and disease modification, minimization of complications such as strictures and fistulae that lead to the need for surgery, reduction of postoperative recurrence, and avoidance of the ubiquitous complications of corticosteroid therapy.},

It is not known whether this is true for adolescents with inactive Crohn disease, when rate of protein synthesis must be greater than that of breakdown for normal development. The objective of this study was to determine whether enteral nutrition acutely suppresses proteolysis and increases protein synthesis in adolescents with inactive Crohn disease. Six adolescents (five males/one female; mean age, 15.8 +/- 1.9 y; range, 13.2-17.6 y; mean bone age, 14.6 +/- 1.8 y; range, 12.5-17 y) participated. Leucine (Leu) and phenylalanine (Phe) kinetics were measured using stable isotopes under fasted and fed conditions during a single study visit. In response to enteral nutrition, the endogenous rates of appearance (Ra) of Leu and Phe (reflecting proteolysis) decreased significantly by 40%. The percentages of splanchnic uptake of Leu and Phe were 35 +/- 10% and 13 +/- 12%, respectively. Under fed conditions, utilization of Phe for protein synthesis increased significantly. We conclude that in clinically stable adolescents with Crohn disease, enteral nutrition promotes anabolism by suppressing proteolysis and increasing protein synthesis. Rates of suppression of proteolysis were similar to those reported previously in normal children.},

OBJECTIVES: To summarize the experience of several pediatric gastroenterology units in Israel using a TGFbeta2-enriched polymeric diet (Modulen IBD) supplementation in children and adolescents with Crohn's disease. METHODS: In a retrospective study we reviewed the charts of 28 children with Crohn's disease (10 girls, 18 boys) who received, in addition to conventional treatment, Modulen IBD as a supplement to their regular nutrition. These children were compared with 18 children supplemented with standard polymeric formula (Ensure Plus) and 18 children without formula supplementation. We recorded clinical manifestations, growth, and the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index before and after initiation of the polymeric diet. RESULTS: The Modulen-treated children showed a significant decrease in PCDAI from 34.3 to 15.7 (P< 0.0001). A significant decrease in PCDAI was recorded also in the Ensure Plus group, from 35 to 22 (P= 0.02) but not in the non-supplemented group. Significant improvements in body mass index (P = 0.01) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P= 0.03) were recorded at follow-up (median 3.4 months) only in the Modulen IBD group. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of children with Crohn's disease, supplementation of the diet with Modulen IBD as well as supplementation with Ensure Plus was associated with a decrease in PCDAI. The children supplemented with Modulen IBD also showed improvement in BMI, suggesting an additional advantage of nutritional therapy in children with this disease.},

   abstract = {Human subjects and their enteric microbiota have evolved together to reach a state of mutual tolerance. Mounting evidence from both animal models and human studies suggests that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a malfunction of this relationship. The enteric microecology therefore represents an attractive therapeutic target with few side effects. Probiotics and prebiotics have been investigated in clinical trials as treatments for IBD, with conflicting results. The evidence for the use of probiotics in the management of pouchitis is persuasive and several studies indicate their effectiveness in ulcerative colitis. Trials of probiotics and prebiotics in Crohn's disease are less convincing. However, methodologies vary widely and a range of probiotic, prebiotic and combination (synbiotic) treatments have been tested in a variety of patient groups with an assortment of end points. Conclusions about any one treatment in a specific patient group can therefore only be drawn on evidence from relatively small numbers of patients. The present article reviews the role of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD and addresses the clinical evidence for the therapeutic manipulation of bowel microbiota using probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in IBD.},

   abstract = {Around 1 in 4 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) present in childhood, the majority around the time of their pubertal growth spurt. This presents challenges over and above those of managing IBD in adults as this period is a time of dramatic psychological and physical transition for a child. Growth and nutrition are key priorities in the management of adolescents and young adults with IBD. Growth failure in IBD is characterized by delayed skeletal maturation and a delayed onset of puberty, and is best described in terms of height-for-age standard deviation score (Z score) or by variations in growth velocity over a period of 3-4 months. Growth failure is common at presentation in Crohn's disease (CD), but less common in ulcerative colitis (UC). The etiology of growth failure is multifactorial. Principal determinants, however, include the inflammatory process per se, with proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1beta, IL-6) being directly implicated. Furthermore, poor nutrition and the consequences of prolonged corticosteroid use also contribute to the significant reduction in final adult height of almost 1 in 5 children. Initially a prompt, where possible steroid-free, induction of remission is indicated. The ideal is then to sustain a relapse-free remission until growth is complete, which is often not until early adulthood. These goals can often be achieved with a combination of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) and early use of immunosuppressants. The advent of potent and efficacious biological agents considerably improves the range of growth-sparing interventions available to children around puberty, although well-timed surgery remains another highly effective means of achieving remission and significant catch-up growth. We carried out a systematic review of publications to identify the best available evidence for managing growth failure in children with IBD. Despite the paucity of high-quality publications, sufficient data were available in the literature to allow practical, evidence-based where possible, management guidelines to be formulated. Although there is clear evidence that exclusive enteral nutrition achieves mucosal healing, its effect on growth has only been assessed at 6 months. In contrast to corticosteroids, EEN has no negative effect on growth. Corticosteroids remain the key therapy responsible for medication-induced growth impairment, although the use of budesonide in selected patients may minimize the steroid effect on dividing growth plates. Immunosuppressants have become a mainstay of treatment in children with IBD, and are being used earlier in the disease course than ever before. However, there are currently no long-term data reporting better growth outcome if these agents are introduced very soon after diagnosis. In comparison, recent data from a large prospective trial of infliximab in children with moderate to severe CD suggested significant catch-up growth during the first year of regular infusions. The only other intervention that has documented clear catch-up growth has been surgical resection. Resection of localized CD, in otherwise treatment-resistant children, early in the disease process achieves clear catch-up growth within the next 6 months. There are no data available that growth hormone improves final adult height in children with CD. In conjunction with expert endocrinological support, pubertal delay, more common in boys, may be treated with parenteral testosterone if causing significant psychological problems. The optimal management of children and adolescents requires a multidisciplinary approach frequently available within the pediatric healthcare setting. Dedicated dietetic support, along with nurse-specialist, child psychologist, and with closely linked medical and surgical care will likely achieve the best possible start for children facing a lifetime of chronic gut disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls. DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4 patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20 IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P = 0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7 ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400 microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis should be explored further.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There is controversy in the literature regarding the effect of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on resting energy expenditure (REE). In many cases this may have resulted from inappropriate adjustment of REE measurements to account for differences in body composition. This article considers how to appropriately adjust measurements of REE for differences in body composition between individuals with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Body composition, assessed via total body potassium to yield a measure of body cell mass (BCM), and REE measurements were performed in 41 children with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in the Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. Log-log regression was used to determine the power function to which BCM should be raised to appropriately adjust REE to account for differences in body composition between children. RESULTS: The appropriate value to "adjust" BCM was found to be 0.49, with a standard error of 0.10. CONCLUSIONS: Clearly, there is a need to adjust for differences in body composition, or at the very least body weight, in metabolic studies in children with IBD. We suggest that raising BCM to the power of 0.5 is both a numerically convenient and a statistically valid way of achieving this aim. Under circumstances in which the measurement of BCM is not available, raising body weight to the power of 0.5 remains appropriate. The important issue of whether REE is changed in cases of IBD can then be appropriately addressed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions are a significant reason for therapeutic failure during thiopurine treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Some smaller series in this patient population have shown that a switch to mercaptopurine may be successful in many cases of azathioprine intolerance. AIM: To assess the long-term outcome of mercaptopurine treatment in a large patient population with azathioprine intolerance. METHODS: We identified 135 patients (74 women; median age 40 years) with Crohn's disease (n = 88) or ulcerative colitis (n = 47) and reviewed their medical records. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients (52%) tolerated mercaptopurine and were followed up for 736 (362-1080) days; 65 patients discontinued mercaptopurine due to adverse events after 25 (8-92) days. Mercaptopurine was tolerated in 71% (12/17) with hepatotoxicity and in 68% (13/19) with arthralgia/myalgia during azathioprine treatment. Previous abdominal surgery was more common in mercaptopurine intolerant patients [39/65 (60%) vs. 27/70 (39%); P = 0.02] and thiopurine methyltransferase activity was higher in mercaptopurine tolerant patients than in mercaptopurine intolerant patients [13.2 (11.4-15.3) vs. 11.8 (9.6-14.2) U/mL red blood cells; P = 0.04; n = 81]. CONCLUSIONS: A trial of mercaptopurine should be considered in azathioprine intolerance, as half of the patients tolerate a switch to mercaptopurine. Patients with hepatotoxicity or arthralgia/myalgia during azathioprine treatment might benefit more often than those with other types of adverse events.},

To review the published literature on spinal involvement with gastrointestinal disease with a view to establishing guidelines for management. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is only 1 previous case report of spinal involvement in diverticular disease and 9 reports of spinal infection secondary to Crohn disease. Psoas abscess, osteomyelitis, cord and nerve root compression, meningitis, and hydronephrosis have all been documented. Infection is usually advanced at presentation and all but 1 patient was taking immunosuppressive drugs. METHODS: Case notes and online databases were reviewed. RESULTS: Management is similar for both Crohn and diverticular disease. Total parenteral nutrition and antibiotic treatment are required as is coordination between orthopedic surgeons, colorectal surgeons, and microbiologists. The spine and abdomen are best imaged with plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging and contrast enhanced computed tomography. Surgery involved a defunctioning stoma, debridement of abdominal and spinal infection, and instrumented stabilization of the spine if instability or vertebral collapse is likely. Operative specimens are most likely to identify the multiple enteric bacteria and fungi involved. CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary approach with aggressive supportive therapy, combined with a planned surgical procedure and appropriate antibiotics can give a good outcome in most cases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Crohn disease (CD) is a heterogeneous disorder. The nucleotide oligomerization domain 2/caspase activating recruitment domain 15 (NOD2/CARD15) gene located at 16q12 is strongly associated with susceptibility to CD in white people but is absent in adult Asian patients, whereas the role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) polymorphisms has also been reported. Because clinical and genetic data in Asian children with CD are lacking, the aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical and genetic characteristics of Taiwanese children with CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All of the children hospitalized at the National Taiwan University Hospital between January 2000 and July 2005 who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CD were enrolled. Their clinical characteristics were recorded, and genomic DNA was extracted from their white blood cells. After polymerase chain reaction was performed, direct sequencing was done to detect the 4 NOD2 hotspot mutations (P268S, R702W, G908R, 1007fs) and TLR4 polymorphisms (Asp299Gly, Thr399Ile). RESULTS: CD was diagnosed in 10 children (6 boys and 4 girls; age range at diagnosis, 14 months to 13 years; median age, 11.1 years). There were 5 children with ileocolonic region involvement, 3 with colonic region involvement, 2 with ileal region involvement, 4 with additional upper gastrointestinal tract involvement, and 2 with additional perianal fistula. Half of the children had growth retardation at diagnosis. Neither NOD2/CARD15 mutations nor TLR4 polymorphisms were found in the 10 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ileocolonic location and inflammatory behavior constitute the most frequent phenotype of CD in Taiwan. Mutations in the NOD2/CARD15 and TLR4 genes that are common in the West are not associated with CD in Taiwanese children.},

   abstract = {Nod2 is an intracellular pattern recognition receptor that detects a conserved moiety of bacterial peptidoglycan and subsequently activates proinflammatory signaling pathways. Mutations in Nod2 have been implicated to be linked to inflammatory granulomatous disorders, such as Crohn's disease and Blau syndrome. Many phytochemicals possess anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is not known whether any of these phytochemicals might modulate Nod2-mediated immune responses and thus might be of therapeutic value for the intervention of these inflammatory diseases. In this report, we demonstrate that curcumin, a polyphenol found in the plant Curcuma longa, and parthenolide, a sesquiterpene lactone, suppress both ligand-induced and lauric acid-induced Nod2 signaling, leading to the suppression of nuclear factor-kappaB activation and target gene interleukin-8 expression. We provide molecular and biochemical evidence that the suppression is mediated through the inhibition of Nod2 oligomerization and subsequent inhibition of downstream signaling. These results demonstrate for the first time that curcumin and parthenolide can directly inhibit Nod2-mediated signaling pathways at the receptor level and suggest that Nod2-mediated inflammatory responses can be modulated by these phytochemicals. It remains to be determined whether these phytochemicals possess protective or therapeutic efficacy against Nod2-mediated inflammatory disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of natalizumab, a humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin-G4 antibody to [alpha]4 integrin, in adolescent patients with moderately to severely active Crohn disease (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a single-arm study, 38 adolescent patients (ages 12-17 y) with active CD (Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] >30) received 3 intravenous infusions of natalizumab (3 mg/kg) at 0, 4 and 8 weeks. The primary analysis was safety, assessed by adverse events, laboratory results, and vital signs. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measurements and formation of anti-natalizumab antibodies also were analyzed. Efficacy outcomes were assessed by changes in PCDAI, quality of life (IMPACT III), and levels of C-reactive protein and serum albumin. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (82%) received 3 natalizumab infusions. The most common adverse events were headache (26%), pyrexia (21%) and CD exacerbation (24%). Clinical response (> or =15-point decrease from baseline PCDAI) and remission (PCDAI < or =10) rates were greatest at week 10 (55% and 29%, respectively). Three patients (8%) tested positive for anti-natalizumab antibodies. The peak level (61.0 and 66.3 microg/mL) and half-life (92.3 and 96.3 h) of natalizumab were comparable after the first and third infusions. Mean [alpha]4 integrin receptor saturation was 93% at 2 hours and <40% at 4 weeks after the first and third infusions. Increase from baseline in circulating lymphocytes ranged from 106% to 122% at 2 weeks and 45% to 65% at 4 weeks after each infusion. CONCLUSION: Natalizumab (3 mg/kg) was well tolerated in these adolescent patients with active CD, with a safety and efficacy profile similar to that of adult natalizumab-treated CD patients. Future studies should evaluate long-term safety and efficacy.},

   abstract = {Nutrition and Crohn's disease (CD) are intertwined because of the central role of nutrition in the care of patients with CD, specifically the theories regarding a dietary contribution to pathogenesis and formal studies investigating the primary role of nutrition as therapy for CD. Perhaps one of the most important studies evaluating the role of nutrition therapy and bowel rest in the management of CD was performed by Greenberg and colleagues in 1988. This pivotal study attempted to define the role of bowel rest as an independent variable in the management of hospitalized patients with active CD unresponsive to the traditional medical therapy that was available at the time. As the first randomized controlled trial evaluating nutrition intervention in CD, it showed that bowel rest was not a major factor in achieving remission during nutrition support and did not affect outcome during 1-year follow-up. Although these discouraging findings would be subsequently replicated, the role of enteral and parenteral nutrition therapy would evolve during the following years as a result of insight into CD pathogenesis, the emergence of more effective medical therapies, and improved understanding of the role of nutrition in the care of patients with CD.},

Crohn's disease (in UK) and mesenteric ischemia (in France) were the most frequent etiologies. In adults, the incidence was estimated at two adults/million inhabitants/year. AIM: This review aimed to provide answer for these questions: 1. Who are patients interested by short bowel syndrome? 2. Which interventions are responsible? 3. What is evolution before and after nutritional assistance? METHODS: An electronic search was performed between 1990 an 2006 in Medline database with the following keywords: "short bowel disease", "treatment" and "inflammatory bowel disease". Recent literature reviews and meta analysis were retained for analysis. RESULTS: After an extensive intestinal resection, nutritional management should start early during the post operative course. This strategy will prevent in time life threatening complications. NPDA is indicated temporarily for short bowel syndrome until intestinal readaptation or definitively in case of severe short bowel syndrome to improve survival and quality of life.},

Thirty-one patients with CD were enrolled in this study. All patients were placed on an enteral nutrition regimen with Elental(R) (Ajinomoto pharmaceutical. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Serum selenium, zinc and copper concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Serum selenoprotein P levels were determined by an ELISA system. Average serum levels of albumin, selenium, zinc and copper were 4.1 +/- 0.4 g/dl, 11.2 +/- 2.8 microg/dl, 71.0 +/- 14.8 microg/dl, and 112.0 +/- 25.6 microg/dl, respectively. In 9 patients of 31 CD patients, serum albumin levels were lower than the lower limit of the normal range. Serum selenium, zinc and copper levels were lower than lower limits in 12 patients, 9 patients and 1 patient, respectively. Serum selenium levels significantly correlated with both serum selenoprotein P levels and glutathione peroxidase activity. Supplementation of selenium (100 microg/day) and zinc (10 mg/day) for 2 months significantly improved the trace element status in CD patients. In conclusion, serum selenium and zinc levels are lower in many CD patients on long-term enteral nutrition. In these patients, supplementation of selenium and zinc was effective in improving the trace element status.},

   abstract = {AIM: To assess the effects of mastic administration on cytokine production of circulating mononuclear cells of patients with active Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: The study was conducted in patients with established mildly to moderately active CD, attending the outpatient clinics of the hospital, and in healthy controls. Recruited to a 4 wk treatment with mastic caps (6 caps/d, 0.37 g/cap) were 10 patients and 8 controls, all of who successfully completed the protocol. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and intracellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) were evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) before and after treatment. RESULTS: Treating CD patients with mastic resulted in the reduction of TNF-alpha secretion (2.1 +/- 0.9 ng/mL vs 0.5 +/- 0.4 ng/mL, P = 0.028). MIF release was significantly increased (1.2 +/- 0.4 ng/mL vs 2.5 +/- 0.7 ng/mL, P = 0.026) meaning that random migration and chemotaxis of monocytes/macrophages was inhibited. No significant changes were observed in IL-6, MCP-1 and GSH concentrations. CONCLUSION: This study shows that mastic acts as an immunomodulator on PBMC, acting as a TNF-alpha inhibitor and a MIF stimulator. Although further double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in a large number of patients is required to clarify the role of this natural product, this finding provides strong evidence that mastic might be an important regulator of immunity in CD.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of mastic administration on the clinical course and plasma inflammatory mediators of patients with active Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: This pilot study was conducted in patients with established mild to moderately active CD, attending the outpatient clinics of the hospital, and in healthy controls. Ten patients and 8 controls were recruited for a 4-wk treatment with mastic caps (6 caps/d, 0.37 g/cap). All patients successfully completed the protocol. CD Activity Index (CDAI), Nutritional Risk Index (NRI), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and total antioxidant potential (TAP) were evaluated in the plasma at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. Results were expressed as mean values +/- SE and P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: Patients exhibited significant reduction of CDAI (222.9 +/- 18.7 vs 136.3 +/- 12.3, P = 0.05) as compared to pretreament values. Plasma IL-6 was significantly decreased (21.2 +/- 9.3 pg/mL vs 7.2 +/- 2.8 pg/ mL, P = 0.027), and so did CRP (40.3 +/- 13.1 mg/mL vs 19.7 +/- 5.5, P = 0.028). TAP was significantly increased (0.15 +/- 0.09 vs 0.57 +/- 0.15 mmol/L uric acid, P = 0.036). No patient or control exhibited any kind of side effects. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that mastic significantly decreased the activity index and the plasma levels of IL-6 and CRP in patients with mildly to moderately active CD. Further double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in a larger number of patients are required to clarify the role of this natural product in the treatment of patients with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Variation in care is a ubiquitous feature of medical practice and may lead to significant differences in health care costs, quality, and outcomes. We undertook this study to determine the extent of intercenter variation in the initial management of children newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease. METHODS: We analyzed the utilization of 5 classes of medication (immunomodulators, prednisone, antibiotics, 5-aminosalicylates, and infliximab) among 311 children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease followed at 10 North American pediatric gastroenterology centers. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare the utilization rate of each class of medication at each of the 10 centers, adjusting for potential confounders including patient age, sex, race, disease severity, and anatomic location of disease. RESULTS: Median utilization of each class of medication was: immunomodulators, 56% (range 29%-97%); prednisone, 78% (range 32%-88%); antibiotics, 29% (range 11%-68%); 5-aminosalicylates, 63.5% (range 18%-92%); and infliximab, 7.5% (range 3%-21%). Each of these treatments showed statistically significant intercenter variation in utilization (P < 0.001 for immunomodulators, prednisone, antibiotics, and 5-ASA; P = 0.02 for infliximab). After adjusting for the demographic and clinical factors listed above, intercenter variation remained significant; however, the low utilization of infliximab precluded multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Widespread intercenter variation in the medical management of newly diagnosed children with Crohn's disease was observed, even after adjusting for possible differences in case mix between institutions. This variation may lead to unintended differences in health care costs and outcomes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Previous US studies of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) prevalence have sampled small, geographically restricted populations and may not be generalizable to the entire nation. This study sought to determine the prevalence of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in a large national sample and to compare the prevalence across geographic regions and other sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: We analyzed the health insurance claims for 9 million Americans, pooled from 87 health plans in 33 states, and identified cases of CD and UC using diagnosis codes. Prevalence was determined by dividing the number of cases by the number of persons enrolled for 2 years. Logistic regression was used to compare prevalence estimates by geographic region, age, sex, and insurance type (Medicaid vs commercial). RESULTS: The prevalence of CD and UC in children younger than 20 years was 43 (95% confidence interval [CI], 40-45) and 28 (95% CI, 26-30) per 100,000, respectively. In adults, the prevalence of CD and UC was 201 (95% CI, 197-204) and 238 (95% CI, 234-241), respectively. The prevalence of both conditions was lower in the South, compared with the Northeast, Midwest, and West. IBD appears to be more common in commercially insured individuals, compared with those insured by Medicaid. CONCLUSIONS: This estimation of the prevalence of IBD in the US should help quantify the overall burden of disease and inform the planning of appropriate clinical services.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by anorexia, malnutrition, altered body composition, and development of mesenteric white adipose tissue (WAT) hypertrophy. Increasing evidence suggests that adipokines synthesized either in WAT or in immune cells, are involved in these manifestations of IBD. Among adipokines leptin, adiponectin and resistin hold a fundamental role while the role of ghrelin in inflammation is not well established. Preliminary studies have shown overexpression of leptin, adiponectin, and resistin in mesenteric WAT of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and significant alterations of circulating serum levels of these adipokines in IBD. It has also been demonstrated that intestinal inflammation causes an increase in endogenous ghrelin production. In animal models of intestinal inflammation, existing data suggest that leptin, adiponectin, and resistin are pivotal mediators of inflammation. Interesting therapeutic interventions based on these data have been suggested. A specific role for hypertrophic WAT has also been implicated in CD. Further efforts with experimental and clinical studies are needed to better understand the role of adipokines in IBD.},

Such blends were recently shown to be highly promising for the site-specific delivery of drugs to the colon in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, in particular Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Importantly, and in contrast to various other colon targeting approaches, the system is adapted to the pathophysiological conditions in the disease state. However, it is yet unknown how desired membrane properties, especially water uptake and dry mass loss kinetics as well as mechanical stability can be adjusted to the specific needs of particular drug treatments. Different highly efficient and easy to apply tools were identified altering the membrane's properties, in particular their mechanical resistance required to withstand the shear forces resulting from the motility of the upper GIT and the hydrostatic pressure built up within the devices upon contact with aqueous media. This includes the variation of the Nutriose:ethylcellulose blend ratio and initial plasticizer content. Importantly, Nutriose also exhibits significant pre-biotic activity, normalizing the microflora in the patients' colon, which is of major clinical benefit in the case of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

METHODS: Articles were restricted to empirical reports in the English language with human subjects. Eleven empirical articles were able to answer "How is psychological stress related to inflammation and/or the expression or course of inflammatory bowel disease?" RESULTS: Studies varied by choice of participant groups, method for classifying disease activity, choice of design, and definition and measurement of stress. Only half of the studies supported the hypothesis that stress affected IBD in some way. CONCLUSIONS: Current methodological limitations in the stress and gut inflammation research have made it difficult for us to ascertain the role of stress in inflammatory bowel disease. Authors provide a checklist of items to consider when designing future studies.},

Activation of latent celiac disease can occur after gastrointestinal surgery. Our objective was to determine whether undiagnosed celiac disease contributes to malabsorption in patients with SBS. METHODS: Adult subjects with SBS were tested for celiac disease using immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibody and total IgA level. Subjects with an elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase were offered upper endoscopy with biopsies of the duodenum. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects were enrolled. The subjects were predominantly white, and the most common cause of SBS was Crohn's disease. The mean length of remaining small bowel was 93.1 +/- 54.6 cm. All subjects had undergone surgeries, resulting in loss of the ileocecal valve. Five subjects were found to have an elevated total IgA. A single patient was found to have an elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody, and subsequent endoscopy demonstrated active gastroduodenal Crohn's disease, without features of celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: No subjects were IgA deficient, but 5 subjects were found to have elevated IgA levels. Undiagnosed celiac disease did not contribute to malabsorption in our small cohort of predominantly white SBS patients. Larger studies are warranted.},

STUDY DESIGN: Clinical, demographic, and BMI data were obtained from 783 patients with newly diagnosed IBD. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data for 2748 healthy children were used as a control. RESULTS: Most children with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis had a BMI in the normative range (5%-84%). Low BMI (<5%) was seen in 22% to 24% of children with Crohn's disease and 7% to 9% of children with ulcerative colitis. Ten percent of children with Crohn's disease and 20% to 30% of children with ulcerative colitis had a BMI at diagnosis consistent with overweight or risk for overweight. CONCLUSION: Children with IBD are affected by current population trends toward overweight. A significant subgroup of children with newly diagnosed IBD has a BMI categorized as overweight or at risk for overweight. Clinicians should be aware of possible IBD diagnosis in the presence increased BMI.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease is a life-long form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mediated by mucosal immune abnormalities. Understanding of the pathogenesis is limited because it is based on data from adults with chronic Crohn's disease. We investigated mucosal T-cell immunoregulatory events in children with early Crohn's disease. METHODS: Mucosal biopsies and T-cell clones were derived from children experiencing the first attack of Crohn's disease, children with long-standing Crohn's disease, infectious colitis, and children without gut inflammation. RESULTS: As in acute infectious colitis, interleukin (IL) 12 induced T cells from early Crohn's disease to acquire a strongly polarised T helper (Th) type 1 response characterised by high IFN-gamma production and IL12Rbeta2 chain expression. Th1 polarisation was not induced in clones from late Crohn's disease. Mucosal levels of IL12p40 and IL12Rbeta2 messenger RNA were significantly higher in children with early than late Crohn's disease. These results demonstrate that susceptibility to IL12-mediated modulation is strongly dependent on the stage of Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: At the onset of Crohn's disease mucosal T cells appear to mount a typical Th1 response that resembles an acute infectious process, and is lost with progression to late Crohn's disease. This suggests that mucosal T-cell immunoregulation varies with the course of human IBD. Patients with the initial manifestations of IBD may represent an ideal population in which immunomodulation may have optimal therapeutic efficacy.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The impact of infliximab (IFX) on postoperative complications in surgical patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is unclear. We examined a large patient cohort to clarify whether a relationship exists between IFX and postoperative complications. METHODS: A total of 413 consecutive patients--188 (45.5%) with suspected CD, 156 (37.8%) with UC, and 69 (16.7%) with indeterminate colitis--underwent abdominal surgery at the Massachusetts General Hospital between January 1993 and June 2007. One hundred one (24.5%) had received preoperative IFX < or = 12 weeks before surgery. These patients were compared to those who did not receive IFX with respect to demographics, comorbidities, presence of preoperative infections, steroid use, and nutritional status. We then compared the cumulative rate of complications for each group, which included deaths, anastomotic leak, infection, thrombotic complications, prolonged ileus/small bowel obstruction, cardiac, and hepatorenal complications. Potential risk factors for infectious complications including preexisting infection, pathological diagnosis, and steroid or IFX exposure were further evaluated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients were similar with respect to gender (IFX = 40.6% men vs. non-IFX = 51.9%, p = 0.06), age (36.1 years vs. 37.8, p = 0.43), Charlson Comorbidity Index (5.3 vs. 5.7, p = 0.25), concomitant steroids (75.3% vs. 76.9%, p = 0.79), preoperative albumin level (3.3 vs. 3.2, p = 0.36), and rate of emergent surgery (3.0% vs. 3.5%, p = 1.00). IFX patients had higher rates of CD (56.4% vs. 41.9%, p = 0.02), concomitant azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine use (34.6% vs. 16.6%, p < 0.0001), and lower rates of intra-abdominal abscess (3.9% vs. 11%, p < 0.05). After surgery, the two groups had similar rates of death (2% vs. 0.3% p = 0.09), anastomotic leak (3.0% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.97), cumulative infections (5.97% vs. 10.1%, p = 1), thrombotic complications (3.6% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.06), prolonged ileus/small bowel obstructions (3.9 vs. 2.8, p = 0.59), cardiac complications (1% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.42), and hepatic or renal complications (1.0 vs. 0.6% p = 0.72). A logistic regression model was then created to assess the impact of IFX, as well as other potential risk factors, on the rates of cumulative postoperative infections. We found that steroids (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2, p = 0.74), IFX (OR 2.5, p = 0.14), preoperative diagnosis of CD (OR = 0.7, p = 0.63) or UC (OR = 0.6, p = 0.48), and preoperative infection (OR = 1.2, p = 0.76) did not affect rates of clinically important postoperative infections. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative IFX was not associated with an increased rate of cumulative postoperative complications.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK), menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of these vitamins.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of exclusive enteral nutrition to treat paediatric Crohn's disease (CD) is widely accepted, although the precise mechanism(s) of action remains speculative. AIM: To investigate the changes to key intestinal bacterial groups of Eubacteria, Bacteroides, Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium leptum and Bifidobacteria, during and after exclusive enteral nutrition treatment for CD in paediatric patients and correlate these changes to disease activity and intestinal inflammation. METHODS: Stool was collected from six children at diagnosis of CD, during exclusive enteral nutrition and 4 months post-therapy, and from seven healthy control children. The diversity of bacteria was assessed by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis with changes to bacterial diversity measured by Bray-Curtis similarity, intestinal inflammation assessed by faecal S100A12 and the disease activity assessed by PCDAI. RESULTS: A significantly greater change in intestinal bacterial composition was seen with exclusive enteral nutrition treatment compared with controls. Further, the intestinal bacteria remained altered 4 months following exclusive enteral nutrition completion. Changes in the composition of Bacteroides were associated with reduced disease activity and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive enteral nutrition reduces bacterial diversity and initiates a sustained modulation of all predominant intestinal bacterial groups. Exclusive enteral nutrition may reduce inflammation through modulating intestinal Bacteroides species. The implications of these results for exclusive enteral nutrition therapy and CD pathogenesis should now be the subject of further investigation.},

The aim of the study was to assess the effects of Gln and Arg alone or in combination on cytokine release by cultured colonic biopsies from patients with active Crohn's disease (CD). Ten consecutive patients [mean (range) age 26 (18-39) y] with active colonic CD (mean CD activity index: 383.7 +/- 129.8) were prospectively included in the study. Eight colonic biopsies were obtained via a colonoscopy and incubated during 18 h with low (physiological) or high (pharmacological) doses of Arg (0.1 or 2 mmol/L designated as Arg(low) or Arg(high), respectively) and Gln (0.6 or 10 mmol/L designated as Gln(low) or Gln(high), respectively). The concentrations of cytokines [interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-8, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), IL-1beta, interferon-gamma) were assessed by ELISA, and nitric oxide (NO) production was evaluated by Griess assay. Nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB p65 subunit, inhibitor of NFkappaB-alpha, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were assessed by immunoblotting. Arg(high)/Gln(high) decreased the production of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-8, and IL-6 (each P < 0.01). Arg(low)/Gln(high) decreased IL-6 and IL-8 production (both P < 0.01), whereas Arg(high)/Gln(low) did not affect cytokine and NO production. Arg(low)/Gln(high) and Arg(high)/Gln(high) decreased NF-kappaB p65 subunit expression, whereas p38 MAPK was decreased only by Arg(high)/Gln(high). Combined pharmacological doses of Arg and Gln decreased TNFalpha and the main proinflammatory cytokines release in active colonic CD biopsies via NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK pathways. These results could be the basis of prospective studies evaluating the effects of enteral supply of combined Arg and Gln during active CD.},

Although low-fiber, high-sugar, and high-animal fat diets have been proposed as a risk factor, the role of nutrition in IBD still needs more conclusive evidence. Nutritional deficiency is a common problem in IBD patients. The goals of nutritional intervention are the prevention and correction of malnutrition, the prevention of osteoporosis, and the promotion of optimal growth and development in childhood. Enteral nutrition is effective in induction and maintenance of the clinical remission in adults and promoting growth in children with Crohn's disease. The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids contained in fish oil may provide short-term benefit to patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, also called chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), affect up to 500 per 100,000 persons in the Western world. Recent studies in the etiology of IBD suggest that these diseases are caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Results from humans and especially animal models of colitis reported by our group and others have indicated that these diseases result from a lack of tolerance to resident intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible hosts. Probiotic bacteria have health-promoting effects for the host when ingested and have also shown efficacy in ulcerative colitis and refractory pouchitis. In light of the efficacy of providing probiotic bacteria to patients with IBD, there has been interest in the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of inulin, oligofructose, and other prebiotics for patients with or at risk of IBD. Prebiotics are nondigestible dietary oligosaccharides that affect the host by selectively stimulating growth, activity, or both of selective intestinal (probiotic) bacteria. Prebiotics are easy to administer and, in contrast to probiotic therapy, do not require administration of large amounts of (live) bacteria and are therefore easier to administer. Studies using prebiotics, especially beta-fructan oligosaccharides, for the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation have shown benefit in animal models of colitis. Studies using these prebiotics alone or in combination with probiotics are emerging and have shown promise. These dietary therapies could lead to novel treatments for these chronic debilitating diseases.},

   abstract = {The same drugs are used to treat hemorrhagic rectocolitis (HRC) and Crohn's disease (CD), although the aims are very different. Aminosalicylates are highly beneficial in HRC but virtually ineffective in CD, a disease in which immunosuppressants are more useful. Aminosalicylates exert their antiinflammatory effect directly on the lesions. Various oral and rectal preparations have been developed in order to deliver the active molecule to the intestinal target segment. These drugs are now known to act by stimulating the nuclear receptor PPAR-gamma, and this knowledge should help with the development of new agents. Chronic aminosalicylate treatment appears to diminish the risk of malignant transformation. Systemic steroids are still the mainstay of treatment for exacerbations of HRC and CD, yielding remissions in 60 to 90% of cases. In contrast, systemic steroids should not be used for maintenance therapy. Budesonide is a preparation that selectively releases steroids in the ileocolonic region, thereby reducing systemic adverse effects. Immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, and also methotrexate in some cases, are used for maintenance therapy of steroid-dependent and highly recurrent forms. These drugs stabilize the disease in about half the patients who receive them. Treatment typically lasts several years and necessitates regular monitoring, especially of hematological status. Cyclosporine is used intravenously in severe HRC. Infliximab (RemicadeR), a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting TNF is effective in acute forms and as maintenance therapy for CD. It was also recently shown to be effective in HRC. Infliximab is indicated in steroid-resistant forms and contraindicated in patients with latent systemic infections (tuberculosis, hepatitis B) and heart failure. Artificial nutrition is now only used in children with acute forms, in order to avoid the need for steroids. Probiotics might have a place in maintenance treatment of HRC. Surgical treatment of HRC consists of colectomy or, more radically, ileoprotectomy followed by ileoanal anastomosis with resection: however, the likely benefits and potential complications (especially nocturnal diarrhea) must be carefully weighed up. Surgical treatment of CD consists of resecting the worst-affected segments. As available medical and surgical treatments can only control these diseases, without curing them, patient management must be planned on a long-term basis. Control of exacerbations is judged on the basis of clinical parameters and biological markers of inflammation, rather than on lesion healing. The choice of maintenance therapy depends on the nature of the disease (HRC or CD) and its progressive nature. Surgery is reserved for patients with complicated and drug-resistant forms.},

Al exposure in food, additives, air, pharmaceuticals, and water pollution is ubiquitous in Western culture. Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals and is influenced by yet unidentified environmental factors. It is hypothesized, in the present review, that Al is a potential factor for induction or maintaining the inflammation in CD. Epidemiologically, CD incidence is higher in urban areas, where microparticle pollution is prevalent. Al immune activities share many characteristics with the immune pathology of CD: increased antigen presentation and APCs activation, many luminal bacterial or dietary compounds can be adsorbed to the metal and induce Th1 profile activity, promotion of humoral and cellular immune responses, proinflammatory, apoptotic, oxidative activity, and stress-related molecule expression enhancement, affecting intestinal bacterial composition and virulence, granuloma formation, colitis induction in an animal model of CD, and terminal ileum uptake. The Al-bacterial interaction, the microparticles homing the intestine together with the extensive immune activity, put Al as a potential environmental candidate for CD induction and maintenance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric-onset Crohn disease (CD) may differ in genotype or phenotype from adult-onset CD. Genome-wide screening recently identified a protective mutation (R381Q) in the interleukin-23 (IL-23) receptor gene located on chromosome 1. The aims of our study were to evaluate whether this mutation is associated with CD in our population and to find whether it may have an impact on age of onset or a specific location phenotype in a pediatric- and adult-onset CD population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 438 individuals (143 with pediatric-onset CD [age <18 years], 139 with adult-onset CD, and 157 control subjects) evaluated for age at onset and disease location were genotyped for the R381Q mutation in the IL-23 receptor gene by pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Mutant allele incidences were 5.7% in the normal cohort and only 2.28% in the CD cohort (P = 0.01). Carriers were found to constitute 8.9% of the normal cohort and only 4.6% of the CD cohort (P = 0.029). Homozygotes were found in only the control cohort. The mean age of onset for all of the patients with the mutation (including both age groups) was 17.8 +/- 6.1 years versus 21.3 +/- 12.4 years for patients without the mutation (P =0.08). The mutation was not associated with differences in sex, site of disease, or ethnicity. We did not find evidence of allelic interaction with CARD15. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the findings that the IL-23 receptor gene coding variant allele R381Q appears to decrease susceptibility to CD in an Israeli Jewish population. We found a trend toward earlier age of onset, but no interactions with CARD15 or modifying effect on disease location.},

Ulcerous colitis is still effectively treated with salicylates and steroids in its mild and moderate forms. Severe forms require parenteral steroids, cyclosporine or infliximab, and these are successfully used with immunosuppressants (azathioprine or mercaptopurine) in steroid dependence. Maintenance with salicylates, that should be adequately complied with, is an important point. Crohn's disease is treated with steroids in its mild and moderate forms, and again in corticodependent ones with immunosuppressants, which we are using increasingly sooner. Refractory forms or fistulous forms benefit from the use of biological treatments (infliximab) generally accompanied by immunosuppressants.},

   abstract = {The clinical, morphological, and histological features of intestinal tuberculosis (IT) and Crohn's disease (CD) mimic so much, that it becomes difficult to differentiate between them. The sensitivity of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) IgG and ASCA IgA in CD is 60%-80%, whereas the specificity is almost 90%. There are no reports of study of ASCA in patients with IT, nor has it ever been used to differentiate CD from IT. Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; n=25), CD (n=59), and IT (n=30) and 21 healthy controls were included in this study. The location and behavior of CD were classified according to the Modified Montreal classification. Five milliliters of blood was taken from them and serum was stored at -70 degrees C. ASCA antibodies (both IgG and IgA) were estimated using commercially available ELISA kits (AESKU Diagnostics, Germany). Anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody was measured by indirect immunofluorescence test. ASCA IgA was positive in 4.7%, 28%, 33.9%, and 43.3% and ASCA IgG was positive in 4.7%, 24%, 50.8%, and 46.6% of healthy controls and patients with UC, CD, and IT, respectively. Either ASCA IgG or ASCA IgA was positive in 9.5%, 40%, 61% and 66.6% of healthy controls, UC, CD, and IT, respectively. ANCA was positive in 0%, 32%, 10.1%, and 6.6% of healthy controls, UC, CD, and IT, respectively. ASCA IgG was positive in a significantly higher number of patients with CD (P<0.0001) and IT (P<0.0001) in comparison to healthy controls. ASCA IgA was positive in a significantly higher number of patients with UC (P<0.04), CD (P<0.013), and IT (P<0.006) in comparison to healthy controls. In comparisons between diseases, ASCA IgG was positive in significantly more patients with CD (P<0.001) and IT (P<0.001) in comparison to UC. There was no significant difference in ASCA IgA (33.9% vs. 43.3%), ASCA IgG (50.86% vs. 46.6%), or ANCA (10.7%, 7.4%) in patients with CD and IT, respectively. There was no correlation between ASCA and duration, location and behavior of CD, and IT. We conclude that ASCA IgG and ASCA IgA do not help to differentiate between IT and CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated gluten-dependent enteropathy induced by ingestion of gluten-containing products, characterized by intestinal malabsorption and subtotal or total atrophy of intestinal villi, which improves after gluten-free diet (GFD). Untreated patients affected by the classic form of CD are at high risk of malnutrition, but an impairment of nutritional status is frequently reported also in patients with the subclinical form of the disease. Strict adherence to a GFD greatly improves nutritional status, inducing an increase in fat and bone compartments, but does not completely normalize body composition. A lack of improvement in nutritional status may identify incomplete adherence to GFD treatment. Evidence has shown lower body weights and lower fat mass and fat-free mass contents in CD patients. Untreated CD patients oxidize more carbohydrates as energy substrate compared to treated subjects. In addition, circulating ghrelin concentration was reduced after GFD treatment as a possible consequence of body composition improvement, while leptin did not correlate with the changes in body composition and substrate oxidation in patients with CD. A significant correlation was reported between ghrelin and the degree of severity of intestinal mucosal lesions. CD patients might show an alteration in lipid metabolism, i.e. low serum total and high- density lipoprotein-cholesterol as a consequence of lipid malabsorption and decreased intake. In conclusion, weight loss and nutritional deficiencies are relevant clinical features in CD. Thus, an early and accurate evaluation of nutritional status and energy metabolism represents a fundamental tool in the management of CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malabsorption of nutrients, fluids and electrolytes is a key finding in patients with short bowel syndrome. If not compensated for by increased intake, it leads to diminished body stores and subclinical, and eventually clinical, deficiencies. Until recently, management options were limited to interventions aimed at provision of adequate macro- and micronutrients and fluids to prevent malnutrition, nutrient deficiencies and dehydration, treatment of associated infections and correction and prevention of acid-base disturbances. Identification of novel gut hormones, combined with the growing understanding of their pivotal role in intestinal adaptation, has provoked interest in developing more specific therapies. AIM: To provide an update on the recent advances on the use of teduglutide in patients with short bowel syndrome. METHODS: A comprehensive Medline search using the terms teduglutide, ALX-0600, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and glucagon like peptide-2 (GLP-2). RESULTS: Teduglutide (GATTEX, ALX-0600; NPS Allelix Corp) is a synthetic DPP-IV-resistant recombinant human GLP-2 analog that differs from GLP-2 only by an N-terminus substitution of glycine for alanine in position 2 of the peptide that renders the component resistant to enzymatic degradation. Based on the results of the few Phase II studies and the preliminary results of a Phase III trial, teduglutide at doses of 0.05 or 0.10 mg/kg/day may improve many clinical, laboratory and histologic abnormalities in short bowel syndrome patients. It appears to be safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Teduglutide is a first-in-class therapy with the potential to create a new standard of care for patients suffering from short bowel syndrome. Future studies to address the appropriate initial and maintenance dosage and optimal duration of treatment are needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of immunomodulatory agents has changed the management of inflammatory bowel disease. Immunosuppressive drugs (mainly thiopurines) and biological treatments (mainly monoclonal antibodies against TNFalpha) are currently most frequently and earlier used. The recent report of new cases of the rare and almost always fatal hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in young patients on combined therapy with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine and infliximab suggests that the optimal strategies for reducing increased risk of side-effects need to be urgently assessed. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We report the effects of stopping immunosupressants in four Crohn's disease patients previously treated with azathioprine and infliximab for 6-12 months as combined therapy. The appearance of infusion reactions due to immunogenicity and the loss of efficacy of infliximab are evaluated. RESULTS: No adverse events attributable to immunosuppression cessation or changes in infliximab efficacy have been noted during a 6-month evaluation period. CONCLUSIONS: Stopping immunosuppressant therapy in Crohn's patients with a previous good response to combination therapy (azathioprine and infliximab) does not result in an increased risk of adverse events or loss of infliximab efficacy. Our results must be confirmed in larger and longer studies. Until the pathogenic role of this combined therapy in the incidence of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma is clearly defined, we consider that monotherapy with infliximab after a period on combined treatment is a safe and effective strategy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Selective granulocyte-monocyte adsorption (GMA) apheresis is a safe technique that has shown efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially in adult steroid-dependent and steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis. GMA apheresis is performed with Adacolumn, a direct blood perfusion system that selectively adsorbs circulating granulocytes and monocytes. Studies on efficacy of GMA apheresis in paediatric IBD are scarce. Our aim was to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of GMA apheresis in paediatric IBD patients followed for 1 year. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients with a mild to moderate flare-up (6 boys, 3 girls; 5 ulcerative colitis [UC], 4 Crohn disease [CD]) were included. Mean age at inclusion was 13 years and 9 months, and mean disease duration before inclusion was 28 months. All of our patients with UC were steroid-dependent; patients with CD had been unsuccessfully treated with other therapies. GMA apheresis consisted of 5 consecutive weekly sessions lasting 60 minutes each. RESULTS: After the 5 sessions, 4 of 5 patients with UC and 1 of 4 patients with CD achieved remission. This remission was maintained in 2 of 4 patients with UC and in the single patients with CD. Patients taking steroids could begin to taper their daily doses after the second apheresis, and 3 of 5 of these patients reached the end of the study steroid-free. GMA apheresis was well tolerated and no severe side effects related to the technique were observed. CONCLUSIONS: GMA apheresis is a safe, well-tolerated technique in paediatric IBD. As previously reported, we have observed a better efficacy in promoting and maintaining remission, and reducing conventional drugs in patients with UC than in patients with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) are 1.4 to 2.5 times more likely than the normal population to sustain a fracture but the factors involved in the pathogenesis are not clearly understood. Bone mass is affected both by nutrition and by muscular activity. Trauma excepted, the largest voluntary loads on bones come from muscle contraction, not body weight. AIM: To assess the relationship between bone mass (bone mineral content) and muscle mass (lean mass) in CD patients. METHODS: Adult CD patients who had had a whole body, lumbar and hip densitometric evaluation were selected. Information regarding age, gender, weight, duration of CD, age at diagnosis, use of glucocorticoids and disease activity during the year before densitometric evaluation and laboratory parameters were collected. RESULTS: Data from 65 patients (28.8+/-10.6 years, F=44, M=21) were analyzed. Lumbar bone mineral content (BMC), BMC in both hips, total and regional BMC significantly correlated with body weight and total and regional lean mass (LM). In multiple regression analysis, only total LM was shown to be independently associated with lumbar BMC, BMC in both hips and total BMC. LM in upper and lower limbs was shown to be independently associated with BMC in upper and lower limbs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that muscular mass and activity, rather than overall body weight, are important determinants of bone mass and, hence of bone strength in Crohn's disease. Thus, the management of bone loss in inflammatory bowel disease should address the effects of both nutrition and exercise on muscle mass.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) have a high risk of developing osteoporosis, but the mechanisms underlying bone mass loss are unclear. Elevated proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), have been implicated in the pathogenesis of bone resorption. AIM: To assess whether suppression of TNFalpha with infliximab treatment has a beneficial effect on lumbar bone mass. METHODS: Adult CD patients who had received infliximab treatment, and who underwent lumbar densitometric evaluation before and during treatment, were selected. Adult CD patients who had never received infliximab treatment were selected as controls. Information regarding age, sex, weight, duration of CD, use of glucocorticoids and bisphosphonates, and signs of disease activity between both densitometric measurements were collected. RESULTS: Data from 45 patients were analyzed. The control group (n=30, mean [+/- SD] 26.7+/-9 years of age) had a significantly higher increase in body weight between both evaluations (6.26%+/-8%) than the infliximab group (n=15, 30.6+/-13 years), which had an increase of 0.3%+/-7.4%. There was a strong correlation between the final weight and lumbar bone mineral content (BMC) in both groups. The infliximab group had a significant increase in lumbar bone area (4.15%+/-6.6%), BMC (12.8%+/-13.6%) and bone mineral density (8.13%+/-7.7%) between both evaluations (interval 22.6+/-11 months) compared with the control group. The increase in BMC in patients who had received infliximab treatment was significant when compared with control patients who had received glucocorticoids (n=8) or had evidence of disease activity (n=13). CONCLUSION: Infliximab therapy improved lumbar bone mass independent of nutritional status. This finding suggests that TNFalpha plays a role in bone loss in CD.},

   abstract = {Wireless capsule endoscopy offers a revolutionary diagnostic tool for small bowel diseases. Since its formal introduction, it has become an integral part of the diagnostic evaluation for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. This relatively noninvasive imaging modality offered by small bowel capsule endoscopy is appealing to both patients and providers and consequently, the desire to expand its diagnostic role continues to grow. The use of CE in the diagnosis of Crohn disease and chronic diarrhea is being further investigated, as is the potential of employing this technique as a cancer surveillance mechanism in patients with hereditary polyposis syndromes which may involve the small bowel. This review article discusses the current indications for small bowel capsule endoscopy, the results of capsule endoscopy in patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding and small bowel diseases, and patient outcomes following capsule endoscopy. Capsule endoscopy is compared with traditional diagnostic modalities, including small bowel series, enteroclysis, CT, and push enteroscopy. Small bowel capsule endoscopy is the procedure of choice to evaluate obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, and is superior to radiographic procedures in detecting Crohn disease of the small bowel.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The epithelium makes numerous important contributions to intestinal function. It acts as a physical barrier to prevent pathogenic infection, but allows nutrient uptake and the bidirectional passage of ions and water to lubricate the intestinal lumen while restricting fluid loss. The epithelium mediates communication between the immune system and the commensal flora, and plays a major role in antigen sampling and development of tolerance. After mucosal injury, the epithelium must reestablish its barrier and transport functions for homeostasis to be restored. Here, we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the roles of the epithelium in intestinal homeostasis. RECENT FINDINGS: Mechanisms responsible for epithelial communication with enteric flora and pathogens include the regulation and function of Toll-like receptors and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-2, and maintenance and repair of epithelial barrier properties, including the role of growth factors and bacterial peptides in epithelial repair. SUMMARY: Recent advances in our understanding of mechanisms by which the gut epithelium modulates, and is modified by, enteric flora and the mucosal immune system illuminate the importance of the epithelium in gut physiology. The work discussed may also identify novel targets that can potentially be modulated therapeutically, either with existing medications or newer agents in development.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although azathioprine usually is reserved for inflammatory bowel disease that proves difficult to control, routine early use has recently been advocated for children with Crohn disease. However, this practice carries with it an increased risk of adverse reactions. The objective of this study was to look for characteristics at first presentation that may identify those likely to benefit from early azathioprine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study setting was a tertiary pediatric gastroenterology department. Retrospective cohort study of 156 children (93 Crohn disease, 47 ulcerative colitis, 16 indeterminate colitis), comparing characteristics at presentation in those who did and did not eventually require azathioprine. Azathioprine was reserved for patients with frequent relapses and steroid dependence/resistance. Twenty variables were examined, including patient and disease characteristics and initial treatment response. These were analysed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazard regression. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 3.9 years (range 0.5-10.6 years). Azathioprine was used in 36% with Crohn disease and 40% with ulcerative colitis. Median time to commencing azathioprine was 14 months (range 3-77.5 months). Multifactorial analysis revealed an association with endoscopic colitis severity in Crohn disease (P < 0.02). However, only 50% with severe Crohn colitis actually needed azathioprine. There was an association with need for intravenous corticosteroids for induction of remission in Crohn disease (P < 0.006) and ulcerative colitis (P < 0.05). Of these patients, 75% required azathioprine. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the early use of azathioprine in children who require intravenous corticosteroids to induce initial remission. No other characteristics examined were of clinical utility in predicting need for azathioprine.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of wireless capsule endoscopy (CE) provides a unique opportunity to visualize the entire small bowel in a minimally invasive manner. Studies in adult patients have demonstrated that the disposable capsule is well tolerated and highly effective, but few studies have been done in children. The aims of our study were to compare the diagnostic yield of CE and small bowel series in children being evaluated for possible small intestine disease and to determine the risk of developing an adverse event following capsule endoscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all children who underwent CE at 1 institution between August 2002 and July 2005. Results of CE were compared with those of small bowel radiographic studies when available. RESULTS: There were 46 CE studies from 45 patients, 28 male and 17 female, with a mean age of 14.9 +/- 3.6 years and mean weight of 49.7 +/- 17.5 kg. The indications for CE included unresponsive Crohn disease (n = 16), possible intestinal polyps (n = 11), unexplained iron deficiency anemia (n = 7), growth failure (n = 5), unresponsive ulcerative colitis (n = 3), persistent abdominal pain (n = 1), protein-losing enteropathy (n = 1), and allergic enteropathy with occult gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 1). Of the 46 CE studies, 41 were completed and 5 were incomplete studies. Based on the CE, 9 patients were newly diagnosed with Crohn disease, 9 patients with Crohn disease were newly diagnosed with small bowel involvement, 8 patients had upper intestinal polyps, 1 patient had findings consistent with Menetrier disease, and 1 had a duodenal ulcer. Thirty-three patients had small bowel series before CE: 24 studies were normal, 6 had abnormal thickening of the small bowel, 2 had polyps, and 1 patient had antral narrowing. All 9 patients with abnormal small bowel series had abnormal CE studies. Of the 24 patients with normal small bowel series, 20 had completed CE studies, and in 10 children, the study was abnormal. Nine of the 45 subjects had adverse events. Five patients had delayed passage from the stomach, with 2 needing endoscopic retrieval of the CE, and 4 had delayed passage from the small intestine (>5 days), with 2 requiring surgical removal, 1 responding to steroids, and the final patient requiring an ileocolic resection 2 months after the CE for an undiagnosed ileal stricture. The only significant association noted was that older patients were more likely to have intestinal retention. CONCLUSIONS: CE provides a valuable tool in the evaluation of pediatric patients for possible small bowel disease. However, the risk of developing complications appears to be greater in the pediatric population, with 20% of our patients having an adverse event.},

Recent studies have identified innate immunity (NOD2), autophagy (ATG16L1) and Th17 pathway (IL23R) genes in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. The pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) is less clear; however, there is growing evidence that proteins involved in the apical junction complex are involved in UC. Here we review the up-to-date studies on the genetic basis for IBD and explore the newly described UC-associated apical junction complex pointing to a primary defect in barrier defense. We will focus on the PTPRS (encoding PTPsigma) gene and discuss its and other apical junction complex proteins' role in the pathogenesis of UC.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a relatively common chronic debilitating intestinal illness, is composed of two broadly defined groups, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Although several susceptibility genes for CD have been recently described, susceptibility genes exclusive for UC have not been forthcoming. Here, we show that receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPRS-encoding PTPsigma) knockout mice spontaneously develop mild colitis that becomes severe when challenged with two known inducers of colitis. We also demonstrate that E-cadherin and beta-catenin, two important adherens junction proteins involved in maintenance of barrier defense in the colon, act as colonic substrates for PTPsigma. Furthermore, we show that three SNPs (rs886936, rs17130, and rs8100586) that flank exon 8 in the human PTPRS gene are associated with UC. The presence of these SNPs is associated with novel splicing that removes the third immunoglobulin-like domain (exon 9) from the extracellular portion of PTPsigma, possibly altering dimerization or ligand recognition. We propose that polymorphisms in the human PTPRS gene lead to ulcerative colitis.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients was done. Our sample consisted of patients 6 to 17 years of age with CD who had received uninterrupted prednisone at an average daily dose of 0.1 to 0.4 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) for at least 8 weeks. Their heights were plotted on sex-appropriate growth charts at 4 time points: 1 year before LTLDP, at therapy onset, at therapy discontinuation, and 1 year after therapy was discontinued. The height velocities (HVs) were compared with the normal HV established by Tanner. The disease activities of 2 groups were compared: LTLDP plus azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine (AZA/6-MP) and LTLDP alone. RESULTS: One hundred two patients were included. The mean age of our sample was 13.7 +/- 2.7 years (standard deviation). The mean dose of prednisone dose was 0.18 +/- 0.07 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)), for a mean duration of therapy of 14.4 +/- 7.2 months. Throughout the study, 78% of patients had normal HV. Growth deceleration was seen in 19% of patients with prior normal growth. Of this group, 31% had "catch-up" growth 1 year after prednisone was discontinued; the remaining 69% did not. Catch-up growth was more likely in patients who had reached the expected age peak HV, which is defined as 12.5 years for girls and 13.5 years for boys (P = 0.04). In addition, 6 patients reached the peak HV after LTLDP discontinuation; 13 did not. We found no difference in the maintenance of remission rate between the compared groups. CONCLUSIONS: A minority of our study population had growth deceleration. Age was an important factor for subsequent catch-up growth. LTLDP efficacy to maintain remission was not different from that of LTLDP plus AZA/6-MP; differences in concomitant therapies (eg, antibiotics, infliximab) between the 2 groups were not statistically significant.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The primary nutritional therapy (PNT), which consists in the administration of exclusive enteral formula feeds (polymeric, semi-elemental or elemental formula) for a period of no less than 6-8 weeks, has proven to be effective in inducing clinical remission in children with Crohn's disease. The clinical remission does not always include histological remission or cure of the mucosa. Faecal calprotectin is closely correlated with endoscopic and histological findings but is slightly associated with clinical activity scores. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational prospective study including all patients under 14 years of age diagnosed with Crohn's disease between January 2002 and October 2007, and who were fed exclusively with polymeric formula (Modulen IBD, Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland) during the onset of the disease. Clinical controls were carried out (weight, height, body mass index [BMI) and the Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI)) and faecal calprotectin was measured at the beginning and at weeks 4 and 8 of treatment. The clinical remission was defined as having a PCDAI less than or equal to 10. Faecal calprotectin values below 50 microg/g faeces were considered as normal. RESULTS: There were 14 patients (9 males), mean age at diagnosis of 10.74 +/- 2.56 years. At week 4, 71 % of patients (10/14) had achieved clinical remission and a decrease in faecal calprotectin levels that was not significant. After 8 weeks, 85 % of our patients were in clinical remission and faecal calprotectin values had declined significantly without reaching normal levels. CONCLUSION: Primary nutritional therapy administered over a period of 8 weeks is capable of inducing clinical remission and improving the degree of inflammation of the intestinal mucosa.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The natural history of paediatric inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is poorly understood. We aim to describe the disease course in this cohort and generate prognostic information for patients and clinicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient records from 6 tertiary paediatric gastroenterology centres were reviewed to generate data concerning original diagnosis, change in diagnosis, family history, surgical interventions, growth, and presence of extragastrointestinal manifestations. RESULTS: Data were collected on 116 children with Crohn disease (CD), 74 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 20 with indeterminate colitis (IC), followed for a mean period of 3.42, 3.3, and 2.9 years from date of diagnosis, respectively. A male predominance is demonstrated in CD. Revision of diagnosis in patients with IC is mainly to UC, with most children receiving a definitive diagnosis within 2 years of initial presentation. Of the children with UC, 17.6% underwent 1 or more major operations with a median time to surgery of 1.92 years. Of children with CD, 11.6% underwent 1 or more major intraabdominal procedures with a median time to surgery of 1.83 years. We recorded a positive family history in 2.7%, 8.2%, and 10% of cases for CD, UC, and IC, respectively. For both boys and girls with CD, but only for boys with UC, height standard deviation score became more negative over time. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study quantifies certain distinctions between IBDs diagnosed in paediatric and adult populations. We document a trend toward male predominance in children with CD. We also note impaired linear growth in children with CD, whereas it appears maintained in girls with UC. We also have recorded a low incidence of IBDs in the families of this cohort and suggest that environmental influences may be of greater importance. We document that major intraabdominal surgery may be required in about 15% of patients with either UC or CD within 2 years of diagnosis, and that the majority of those diagnosed initially with IC will be reclassified as either UC or CD within 2 years.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parenteral nutrition has a limited role in the in-patient management of inflammatory bowel disease. AIM: To determine nationwide patterns of in-patient parenteral nutrition utilization and its demographic determinants and impact on outcomes. METHODS: We identified inflammatory bowel disease discharges in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 1998 and 2003 and determined rates of parenteral nutrition utilization among US census regions, in-hospital mortality and hospital resource utilization. RESULTS: The parenteral nutrition utilization rate among hospitalized inflammatory bowel disease patients was 6%. Only 64% of Crohn's disease and 55% of ulcerative colitis discharges who received parenteral nutrition had malnutrition, fistulizing or obstructive Crohn's disease, or surgery as an indication. The adjusted odds ratio of receiving parenteral nutrition were 0.36 (95% CI: 0.26-0.51) for the mid-west, 0.47 (0.37-0.56) for the south and 0.70 (0.56-0.89) for the west, compared to the north-east. Use of parenteral nutrition was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (OR 2.5; 95% CI: 1.93-3.24), length of stay (13.7 vs. 5.7 days, P < 0.001) and hospital charges ($51,729 vs. $19,563, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In-patient utilization of parenteral nutrition for inflammatory bowel disease varies markedly by census region, expends significant resources, and leads to potentially significant adverse outcomes. These findings underscore the need for guidelines for judicious parenteral nutrition use in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at increased risk of protein-calorie malnutrition. We sought to determine the prevalence of clinically diagnosable malnutrition among those hospitalized for IBD throughout the United States and whether this malnutrition influenced health outcomes. METHODS: We queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 1998 and 2004 to identify admissions for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) and a representative sample of non-IBD discharges. We assessed the prevalence and predictors of malnutrition and its association with in-hospital mortality and resource utilization. RESULTS: The prevalence of malnutrition was greater in CD and UC patients than in non-IBD patients (6.1% and 7.2% versus 1.8%, P < 0.0001). The adjusted odds ratio for malnutrition among IBD admissions compared with non-IBD admissions was 5.57 [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.29-5.86]. More IBD discharges than non-IBD discharges with malnutrition received parenteral nutrition (26% versus 6%, P < 0.0001). There was increased likelihood of malnutrition among those with fistulizing CD (OR 1.65; 95% CI: 1.50-1.82) and among those who had undergone bowel resection (OR 1.37; 95% CI: 1.27-1.48). Malnutrition was associated with increased in-hospital mortality 3.49 (95% CI: 2.89-4.23), length of stay (11.9 days versus 5.8 days, P < 0.00001), and total charges ($45,188 versus $20,295, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically apparent malnutrition is more frequent among IBD admissions than among non-IBD admissions. Its association with greater mortality and resource utilization may reflect more severe underlying disease that can lead to both malnutrition and worse outcomes. Nonetheless, diagnosable malnutrition may serve as a clinical marker of poor IBD prognosis in hospitalized patients.},

We aimed to assess the effect of two different enteral supplements of Impact(R) Powder (IP; Novartis, Switzerland) on leptin levels and nutritional status in active CD patients during prednisolone treatment and tapering. METHODS: Thirty-one CD patients were randomized to IP Extra (group 1) or IP Standard (group 2). Leptin levels, nutritional, clinical and biochemical markers were studied at inclusion, after 5 and after 9 weeks of the study. RESULTS: Leptin levels, body mass index (BMI) and total cholesterol increased significantly within both groups at week 5 compared to inclusion. Leptin levels correlated with BMI in both groups at inclusion and in group 2 at week 9. In group 1, triglyceride levels remained unchanged, while levels in group 2 increased significantly at week 5 compared to inclusion. Clinical and biochemical markers improved during the study compared to inclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Increased leptin levels during the study progress were transient, decreasing due to prednisolone withdrawal at the end of the study. Both formulas used as adjuvant therapy to prednisolone treatment were able to improve nutritional status in CD patients.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A previously described method for assessment of response pattern to various treatments for CD was used. Patients who received EN during the 10-year period 1995-2005 were prospectively registered. Patient data, clinical outcome, time to relapse and subsequent need for treatment were extracted from the files. Four weeks treatment with polymeric ready-to-use liquid formula was given. The clinical outcome was assessed by pattern recognition of the disease course 30 days (immediate response) and 90 days (long-term response) after start of EN. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (17/14 M/F), median age 14 years (range 7.5 -19.8 years), received 46 courses of EN. Thirty-seven courses (80%) were completed. Immediate response: twenty-five courses (67%) led to complete response (CR), 8 (22%) to partial response (PR) and in 4 courses (11%) no response (NR) was achieved. Long-term response: 21 courses (64%) led to prolonged response (PRO), defined as either maintenance of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), while 12 courses (36%) were followed by loss of response (LR). The median time to relapse was 8.3 months (range 0.5-39 months). CONCLUSION: We found our model of response pattern to be a useful instrument for the description of results obtained during EN in children with CD.},

The concentration of CO in the breath of 23 patients with IBD was 2.5+/-0.9 (1.1-4.3) ppm. This concentration comes within the range of standard values in our previous reports (2.5+/-2.2 ppm). Any significant difference was not observed between 2.4+/-0.9 (1.5-4.3) ppm for the 11 Crohn's disease patients and the 2.6+/-1.0 (1.1-3.9) ppm for the 12 ulcerative colitis patients.

We aim to evaluate pediatric IBD response to adalimumab. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of pediatric IBD patients treated with adalimumab. We defined response as either a decrease in the disease activity index severity or remission after 3-6 months of treatment. RESULTS: Ten patients were identified. Seven had CD, three had ulcerative colitis (UC). All had colonic disease and disease in either the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. Eight patients initially responded to infliximab, 5 with CD and 3 with UC; 2 CD patients had incomplete data for evaluation. The mean and median times between initial infliximab and initial adalimumab were 29.5 and 24 months, respectively. Eight patients responded to adalimumab 40 mg or 80 mg biweekly, or 80 mg initial dose followed by 40 mg biweekly. The mean Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) in CD patients before and after adalimumab were 12 and 4.2, respectively (normal <or=10). The mean Lichtiger Colitis Activity Index (LCAI) in UC patients before and after adalimumab were 9 and 5.1, respectively (normal <10). Corticosteroids were weaned off in 4/7 patients at 1 to 10 months after initiation of adalimumab. One patient with CD and 1 patient with UC failed adalimumab, required surgery, and remained on corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab is useful in pediatric IBD patients who become intolerant of infliximab.},

Studies on health care cost of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are reviewed here. These studies were carried out in various countries with disparate health care systems. In the United States, data were often modeled or retrieved from large insurance schemes. Surgery and in-patient hospitalization accounted for over half the outlay on UC and CD. Fistulous disease in CD and parenteral nutrition were very costly. In Canada, overall charges were lower than in the United States, but there too, surgical costs were relatively high. In European studies, economic data were abstracted directly from patients' files. One pan-European study examined the outlay on UC and CD in a community-based prospective inception cohort followed for 10 years. Overall costs in Europe were lower than in the United States. Surgery, hospitalization, year of follow-up, disease phenotype in CD and ASCA-positivity impacted significantly on costs. In all studies, the cost data were right skewed, aminosalicylates were expensive drugs, and biological agents the most expensive; moreover indirect costs were not calculated. Infliximab raised costs considerably in CD, but there were no long-term follow-up studies, so that the cost-benefit of biological agents remains unknown. In conclusion, costs of managing UC and CD vary by country, surgery, genotype and several other factors. The most important question for further research is whether the biological therapies are cost-effective in the long-term.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of adherence to prescribed medications in children with Crohn disease and to identify possible factors associated with nonadherence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 51 pediatric patients with Crohn disease who were prescribed maintenance therapy with a thiopurine immunomodulator (6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine) and/or mesalamine during a 180-day period. Medication adherence rates were calculated from a validated formula using pharmacy records, and nonadherence was defined as a refill rate of <80% of the prescribed medication. Seventy-five percent of patients were prescribed thiopurine immunomodulators and 86% were prescribed mesalamine. RESULTS: The prevalence of nonadherence was 50% for the thiopurine immunomodulators and 66% for mesalamine. The mean number of emergency department visits for patients adherent to mesalamine was significantly greater than the nonadherent group (P < 0.0008). Having an emergency department visit increased the chances of a patient being adherent to mesalamine therapy by >9-fold (odds ratio, 9.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.87-52.17). The mean number of total health care visits was significantly greater for patients adherent to mesalamine (6.1 +/- 0.8) compared with those who were not adherent (3.0 +/- 0.4) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that nonadherence to thiopurine immunomodulator or mesalamine therapy in pediatric patients with Crohn disease is common. Having a health care visit was associated with being adherent.},

ONS and/or TF in addition to normal food is indicates in undernourished patients with CD or UC to improve nutritional status. In active CD EN is the first line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible. No significant differences have been shown in the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and hole protein formulae for TF. In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid dependent patients in CD. In patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the adaptation phase and should be changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in addition to normal food. Special nutrition support should not be used routinely in patients with mild or moderate acute pancreatitis. EN is the preffered route in patients with pancreatitis and should be attempted before initiating parenteral nutrition. Nutrition assessment in patients with liver disease should include screening for micronutrient deficiencies. Protein restriction should be implemented for the acute management of hepatic encephalopathy and should not be implemented chronically in patients with liver disease.},

In these patients, enteral nutrition should be used unless there exist contraindications. Nutritional support as the primary therapy is no indicated in adults (since steroidal therapy has shown to be more effective) but in the case of intolerance or lack of response to medical treatment. By contrast, enteral nutrition is considered a first line therapy in children. There is no clear benefit with the use of specific formulas (modified fat, glutamine...), so that their routine use is not recommended. In spite of the great technical and scientific advances, there are still many fields in which knowledge should be broaden; some of them are pointed out in this publication.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To extend development of a pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measure by determining its factor structure and associations of factors with generic HRQoL measures and clinical variables. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of children and adolescents ages 8 years to 18 years and their parents attending any of 6 US IBD centers, recruited from either existing registry of age-eligible subjects or visits to participating centers. The survey included generic (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) and IBD-specific (Impact Questionnaire) quality of life measures, disease activity, and other clinical indicators. We carried out factor analysis of Impact responses, comparing resulting factors with results on the generic HRQoL and the clinical measures. RESULTS: We included 220 subjects (161 with Crohn disease and 59 with ulcerative colitis). Initial confirmatory factor analysis did not support the 6 proposed Impact domains. Exploratory factor analysis indicated 4 factors with good to excellent reliability for IBD responses: general well-being and symptoms, emotional functioning, social interactions, and body image. Two items did not load well on any factor. The 4 factors correlated well with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and subscales. Children with higher disease activity scores and other indicators of clinical activity reported lower HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further characteristics of a HRQoL measure specific to pediatric IBD and indicates ways to score the measure based on the resulting factor structure. The measure correlates appropriately with generic HRQoL measures and clinical severity indicators.},

METHODS: One hundred forty patients with CD were compared with 248 matched healthy controls. RESULTS: Plasma homocysteine levels were higher in CD patients than controls (11.8 vs 10.4 micromol/L, P= 0.0004). Vitamin B12 and folate levels were lower in CD subjects compared to controls (207 vs 255 pmol/L, P= 0.0082, and 8.6 vs 11 nmol/L, P= 0036, respectively). Patients with a personal history of ileal resection, ileitis, or colectomy had significantly lower vitamin B12 levels. In multivariate analysis, vitamin B12 and MTHFR 677 TT carriers were the two significant independent factors of plasma homocysteine >15 micromol/L in CD patients (P= 0.0187 and 0.0048, respectively). The significant association between homocysteine and vitamin B12 levels remained significant only in patients with the highest superoxide dismutase values (P < 0.0001). The MTRR AA genotype was a significant independent predictor of CD risk (odds ratio 3.7, 95% CI 1.218-11.649, P= 0.0213). The level of superoxide dismutase was significantly higher (P= 0.0143) and was correlated with Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores (P for trend = 0.0276) in patients carrying MTRR AA genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin B12 and MTHFR 677 TT genotype are the main determinants of hyperhomocysteinemia in CD patients. The association of MTRR 66A>G polymorphism with oxidant stress and disease activity provides rationale for screening vitamin deficiencies in these patients.},

This approach can potentially be harnessed to reduce the incidence or symptoms of chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It becomes desirable to interrogate the vast number of discrete compounds present in foods for their ability to influence the phenotype of a cell carrying a variant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Here we describe two cell-based assays that can now be used to test the ability of food components or extracts, to overcome the functional effects of certain variant SNPs that may be important in human IBD. The first monitors the signal transduction pathways of key pattern recognition receptors, in which SNPs associated with IBD have been identified, and tests for food components or extracts that can modulate these pathways for potential therapeutic benefit. The second models the NOD2 3020insC SNP, which is the most common and highest risk variant in Crohn's disease, and examines the ability of food components or extracts to restore the normal phenotype in the mutant cell line. Such screens provide a scientific basis for the rational choice of foods to be more rigorously investigated in animal models of IBD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Infectious agents are still thought to be involved in the origin of inflammatory bowel disease. The focus in recent years has been more on Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis, adherent-invasive Escherichia coli or yeasts. RECENT FINDINGS: A metaanalysis has shown a significant association of M. avium subsp paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease and a large randomized placebo-controlled trial reported an absence of sustained beneficial effects of combined antibiotic therapy on remission of active Crohn's disease. Adherent-invasive E. coli adhere via type 1 pili to carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6), abnormally expressed by intestinal epithelial cells in Crohn's disease patients. Both colonization of the ileal mucosa and stimulation of ileal epithelial cells by tumour necrosis factor-alpha induce overexpression of CEACAM6, leading to an amplification loop of colonization and inflammation. Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan antibodies are the most prevalent serologic marker in Crohn's disease. Major oligomannose epitopes supporting antibody formation are expressed by Candida albicans in human tissues, suggesting that a loss of tolerance to C. albicans could lead to antibody formation in a subset of Crohn's disease patients who are genetically predisposed. SUMMARY: M. avium subsp paratuberculosis, adherent-invasive E. coli and Candida are good candidates for an infectious aetiology of Crohn's disease on the basis of genetic susceptibility, which relates to impaired function in the defence against intracellular bacteria.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is well established that Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with an increased risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA). The data concerning SBA risk factors in CD are scanty. The aim of this study was to identify them. METHODS: In 11 French centers affiliated with the GETAID (Groupe d'Etude Therapeutique des Affections Inflammatoires du Tube Digestif), we identified 29 patients with CD and SBA. Eighty-seven CD controls without SBA recruited in a single center were matched to the cases for sex, age, duration, and CD site. A conditional logistic regression, taking into account the matching between cases and controls, was performed. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, the cases had had significantly less small bowel resection and received prolonged treatment with salicylates (more than 2 yr), less often than the controls (odds ratio, OR [95% confidence interval, CI] 0.07 [0.01-0.32] and 0.29 [0.10-0.82], respectively). In multivariate analysis, both associations remained significant (OR 0.04 [0.01-0.28], P= 0.001; OR 0.16 [0.03-0.79], P= 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that small bowel resection and prolonged salicylates use may protect against SBA in CD patients.},

   abstract = {Dietary microparticles are non-biological bacterial-sized particles of the gastrointestinal lumen that occur due to endogenous formation (calcium phosphate) or following oral exposure (exogenous microparticle). In the UK, about 40 mg (10(12)) of exogenous microparticles are ingested per person per day, through exposure to food additives, pharmaceutical/supplement excipients or toothpaste constituents. Once ingested, exogenous microparticles are unlikely to pass through the gastrointestinal tract without adsorbing to their surfaces some ions and molecules of the intestinal lumen. Both entropy and ionic attraction drive such interactions. Calcium ions are especially well adsorbed by dietary microparticles which then provide a positively charged surface for the attraction (adsorption) of other organic molecules such as lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans or protein antigen from the diet or commensal flora. The major (but not only) sites of microparticle entry into intestinal tissue are the M-cell rich lymphoid aggregates (termed Peyer's patches in the small bowel). Indeed, it is well established that this is an efficient transport route for non-biological microparticles although it is unclear why. We hypothesise that this pathway exists for "endogenous microparticles" of calcium phosphate, with immunological and physiological benefit, and that "exogenous dietary microparticles", such as titanium dioxide and the silicates, hijack this route. This overview focuses on what is known of these microparticles and outlines their potential role in immune tolerance of the gut (endogenous microparticles) or immune activation (exogenous microparticles) and inflammation of the gut.},

   abstract = {Crohn disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Its etiology remained obscure until recently, when, through an overwhelming body of research, the main theme of its origin became clear. CD develops in individuals who carry risk alleles for the disease that can cause a loss of physiological tolerance to commensal bacteria. As a consequence, immune responses develop that activate a whole range of immunocompetent cells, resulting in the secretion of proinflammatory mediators that ultimately cause mucosal breaks and the formation of ulceration, edema, and loss of proper function.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-term administration of home total parenteral nutrition (HTPN) has permitted patients with chronic intestinal failure to survive for prolonged periods of time. However, HTPN is associated with numerous complications, all of which increase morbidity and mortality. In Canada, a comprehensive review of the HTPN population has never been performed. OBJECTIVES: To report on the demographics, current HTPN practice and related complications in the Canadian HTPN population. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Five HTPN programs in Canada participated. Patients' data were entered by the programs' TPN team into a Web site-based registry. A unique confidential record was created for each patient. Data were then downloaded into a Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp, USA) spreadsheet and imported into SPSS (SPSS Inc, USA) for statistical analysis. RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients were entered into the registry (37.9% men and 62.1% women). The mean (+/- SD) age was 53.0+/-14 years and the duration requiring HTPN was 70.1+/-78.1 months. The mean body mass index before the onset of HTPN was 19.8+/-5.0 kg/m(2). The primary indication for HTPN was short bowel syndrome (60%) secondary to Crohn's disease (51.1%), followed by mesenteric ischemia (23.9%). COMPLICATIONS: over one year, 62.7% of patients were hospitalized at least once, with 44% of hospitalizations related to TPN. In addition, 28.6% of patients had at least one catheter sepsis (double-lumen more than single-lumen; P=0.025) and 50% had at least one catheter change. Abnormal liver enzymes were documented in 27.4% of patients and metabolic bone disease in 60% of patients, and the mean Karnofsky score was 63. CONCLUSIONS: In the present population sample, the data suggest that HTPN is associated with significant complications and health care utilization. These results support the use of a Canadian HTPN registry to better define the HTPN population, and to monitor complications for quality assurance and future research.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Normal sleep is paramount for a healthy lifestyle and high quality of life. Sleep modulates the immune system and thus affects the course of several chronic inflammatory conditions. There are no reported studies that address the role of sleep disturbance in the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to characterize sleep disturbance in IBD using validated measures of sleep and quality of life. METHODS: A self-administered, mail-in questionnaire package was sent to 205 subjects after a brief instruction. The questionnaire package was composed of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a measure of disease severity and the IBD-Quality of Life Questionnaire. A total of 119 subjects were recruited (58% response rate): 80 with inactive IBD, 24 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 15 healthy controls. RESULTS: The IBD subjects reported significantly prolonged sleep latency, frequent sleep fragmentation, higher rate of using sleeping pills, decreased day-time energy, increased tiredness and poor overall sleep quality compared to healthy controls. The abnormal sleep patterns in IBD subjects were similar to IBS subjects. The reported sleep quality was correlated with IBD disease severity score (r(2) = 0.55, P = 0.02). Both IBD and IBS subjects thought that sleep and their disease status were correlated. CONCLUSION: The results show that IBD patients have significant sleep disturbance even when their disease is not active. This problem might affect quality of life, gastrointestinal symptoms and coping ability, and might potentially modify disease severity or increase risk of flare-up. Regardless of the primary or secondary origin of this problem, sleep disturbance should be addressed in the clinical management of patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The majority of children with Crohn disease (CD) are likely to need some form of immunomodulatory therapy to maintain remission and to avoid long-term corticosteroid usage. Although thiopurine agents are commonly used, some children are unresponsive or intolerant to these drugs. Biological agents like infliximab are being increasingly used in these circumstances, but long-term safety has yet to be established. Methotrexate has been shown to induce and maintain remission in CD in many adult studies, but pediatric data are limited. The present report describes our experience of using methotrexate in CD in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All children with CD treated with methotrexate were identified by the departmental database. Case records were reviewed for site of disease, Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index, medications, time to achieve remission, duration of remission, and complications. RESULTS: A total of 10 children received methotrexate, 7 of whom were female and 3 of whom were male. All of the children had colonic involvement and had active disease despite previous standard medical treatments. Seven children exhibited remission with methotrexate treatment. Median time to achieve remission was 12 weeks and median duration of remission was 21 months to the point of assessment. One child had transient increase of alanine aminotransferase levels and another developed neutropenia, which remitted with dose reduction. None needed discontinuation of methotrexate treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Methotrexate is effective and well tolerated in children with CD. It should be considered in those patients who do not experience a remission with standard medications because it may avoid the use of biological agents and their potential uncertain long-term side effects.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nutrition plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and treatment of the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In addition, patients with inflammatory bowel disease are often found to have nutrient deficiencies at the time of diagnosis, whereas others develop features of malnutrition over the course of their illness. Therefore, an understanding of the relationship between nutrients and inflammatory bowel disease is important if these patients are to receive optimal care. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiologic and basic research has helped to shed light on the interaction between diet and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Numerous clinical trials utilizing various types of lipids, including fish oil and short chain fatty acids, suggest that fats play an important role in the inflammatory response that characterizes inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamins and other micronutrients involved in nutrient metabolism and modulation of oxidative stress are also considered in this review. SUMMARY: This update discusses nutritional issues that can be used to help prevent and treat nutrient deficiencies and ameliorate disease activity in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Dysregulation of interleukin-8 (IL-8) production has been proposed to contribute to intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Previous studies, which evaluate adult patients with long-standing or steroid-modulated disease, have reported conflicting results regarding the role of IL-8 in IBD pathogenesis. The present study evaluates IL-8 in colonic organ cultures and sera of newly and previously diagnosed pediatric IBD patients with various degrees of histopathologic activity. Colon and terminal ileum biopsies were obtained from 26 patients with Crohn's disease, 12 with ulcerative colitis, 4 with indeterminate colitis, and 12 age-matched normal controls. IBD patients were additionally characterized as newly or previously diagnosed. Supernatants from organ-cultured lamina propria biopsies and sera were evaluated by ELISA for IL-8 protein. IL-8 increased with degree of histologic inflammation regardless of diagnosis (no pathologic diagnosis, 62.6 ng/ml, interquartile range [IQR] 30.4-94.6 ng/ml; mild, 92.0 ng/ml, IQR 21.9-170.0 ng/ml; moderate, 676.2 ng/ml, IQR 46.4-2967.7 ng/ml; severe, 585.6 ng/ml, IQR 149.7-1602.2 ng/ml; P < 0.01). Lamina propria IL-8 was significantly elevated in moderately and severely inflamed tissue segments (603.26 ng/ml; IQR, 72.15-2240.4 ng/ml) compared to noninflamed and mildly inflamed segments (67.70 ng/ml; IQR, 30.38-124.1 ng/ml; P = 0.0009). There was no significant trend in IL-8 concentration when compared by clinical diagnosis. No significant difference was found in IL-8 concentrations in organ cultures from newly diagnosed patients versus those from previously diagnosed patients. There was no significant correlation between serum IL-8 concentration and organ culture IL-8 concentration. We conclude that higher concentrations of IL-8 are found in more histologically inflamed tissue segments from pediatric IBD patients. IL-8 does not appear to be associated with clinical IBD subtype. IL-8 appears to be an integral part of both early and established mucosal inflammation in pediatric IBD patients. These findings suggest that IL-8-specific therapies may universally modify inflammatory activity in IBD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease commonly recurs after intestinal resection. We evaluated whether the administration of infliximab after resective intestinal surgery for Crohn's disease reduces postoperative recurrence. METHODS: We randomly assigned 24 patients with Crohn's disease who had undergone ileocolonic resection to receive intravenous infliximab (5 mg/kg), administered within 4 weeks of surgery and continued for 1 year, or placebo. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with endoscopic recurrence at 1 year. Secondary end points were clinical recurrence and remission and histologic recurrence. RESULTS: The rate of endoscopic recurrence at 1 year was significantly lower in the infliximab group (1 of 11 patients; 9.1%) compared with the placebo group (11 of 13 patients; 84.6%) (P = .0006). There was a nonsignificant higher proportion of patients in clinical remission in the infliximab group (8 of 10; 80.0%) compared with the placebo group (7 of 13; 53.8%) (P = .38). The histologic recurrence rate at 1 year was significantly lower in the infliximab group (3 of 11 patients; 27.3%) compared with the placebo group (11 of 13 patients; 84.6%) (P = .01). The occurrence of adverse events was similar between the placebo and infliximab groups, and none occurred in the immediate postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of infliximab after intestinal resective surgery was effective at preventing endoscopic and histologic recurrence of Crohn's disease.},

The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of CD patients who require dose intensification and factors associated with dose intensification. METHODS: All CD patients who received at least 8 doses of infliximab at the University of Pittsburgh infusion center were included in an analysis to determine the need for dose intensification. Dose intensification was defined as either an increase in infliximab dose, a decrease in interval, or both. Factors were analyzed for association with dose intensification during follow-up. RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2005 there were 108 CD patients who received at least 8 infliximab doses. At 30 months from initial infusion, 69.1% were event-free from an interval decrease, 48.5% from a dose increase, and 45.7% from any dose intensification. Of the 54 patients who received dose intensification, 75.9% were able to regain response and remained on infliximab. The 30-month event-free rates did not differ by whether the patient had received prior infliximab therapy (P=0.49), had a lapse of more than 6 months between infusions (P=0.75), or were on concomitant immunomodulators (P=0.82). CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of CD patients on long-term infliximab treatment lose response and require an increase in dose and/or decrease in infusion interval. The majority of these patients regain response with dose intensification. Every-8-week maintenance infusions and concomitant immunomodulators did not alter the rate of infliximab dose intensification.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a complex multifactorial disorder characterized by the alternation of a cytokine-driven T-lymphocyte-depending inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, and "off" periods, where patients are completely asymptomatic. Although all the causative factors have not been clearly identified, the continuously growing understanding of the major abnormalities of the inflammatory and immune response leading to the often debilitating symptoms reported by Crohn's disease patients, improves our capacity to characterize new potential therapeutic targets with the subsequent hope to discover new (more efficient and less toxic) drugs. Saying that, in the recent years, tumor necrosis factor-alpha undoubtedly emerges as a key cytokine involved in Crohn's disease pathogenesis, and constant efforts have been made to control tumor necrosis factor-alpha deleterious effects in Crohn's disease. This review schematically summarizes the current understanding of tumor necrosis factor-alpha's role in Crohn's disease pathogenesis as well as the present and the future treatment strategies which may be helpful in patients by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-alpha production and effects. Beside drugs under investigation, several original approaches are described or mentioned, most of them leading to recent patents such as polyclonal anti-TNF-alpha antibodies from avian origin, allowing potentially oral administration, or combination strategies such as vitamin D and anti-TNF-alpha antibodies or methotrexate and anti-TNF-alpha antibodies, or decoy oligodeoxynucleotides interfering with the binding of nuclear factor-kappaB to its target genes promoters.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To study the use patterns of a Persian web-based patient education system for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients in Iran. METHODS: A web-based patient education system was developed with Persian content in three sections: general, ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD). The website included a forum for patients to communicate as a self-help group. A customized web tracking system recorded web use statistics. Polls at the bottom of each page collected the visitors' opinion on the extent of helpfulness and readability of page contents. Web use data were analyzed for an 18-month period from October 2004 to April 2006. RESULTS: Having excluded page visits from search engine robots, the website's homepage was visited 4452 times (mean of monthly visits: 234, range: 102-330). The web pages titled Anatomy of gastrointestinal system, Nutrition in IBD, Diagnostic tests, How to cope with IBD, and IBD in women were the most favorite in general section. The web page titled IBD treatment was the most visited in both CD and UC sections followed by the web pages on cause of disease, diagnostic procedures and complications in CD section; and those titled symptoms, cause of disease and risk factors in the UC section. Overall, the content evaluation polls received 294 hits (from 186 unique visitors) of which, 196 (67%) were from patients, 30 (10%) from patients' relatives/friends, 21 (7%) from doctors, and 47 (16%) from other groups. During the 18-month period, 47 patients registered in the self-help forum, 24 threads were opened, and 97 posts (33 in CD and 64 in UC section) were sent. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the increasing trend of Internet use in developing countries like Iran, and the consequent increase in the proportion of Internet-using patients, and finally the time constraints gastroenterologists face answering patients' questions; similar websites seem to be effective ways of patient education in close future.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active Crohn's disease can be treated using liquid diet therapy (LDT), but non-adherence may limit success, necessitating corticosteroid therapy. Whole-protein polymeric formula (PF) seems to be much more palatable than amino acid-based elemental formula (EF) and thus may significantly improve adherence to LDT. AIM: To compare adherence to LDT using PF versus EF. METHODS: Success in completing a 6-week course of LDT, need for nasogastric tube administration of formula and use of LDT for relapses were compared between children presenting with active disease and treated with EF (n = 53) and children given PF (n = 45). RESULTS: Remission rates were similar (EF 64%, 95% CI 51 to 77 vs PF 51%, 95% CI 37 to 66; p>0.15). 72% (95% CI 60 to 84) given EF completed the initial course of LDT compared with 58% (95% CI 44 to 72) given PF (p = 0.15). Of those failing to complete the initial course, 13% on EF and 16% on PF gave up by choice (non-adherence), the remainder stopping due to treatment failure. Nasogastric administration was more frequent with EF (55%, 95% CI 42 to 68) compared to PF (31%, 95% CI 17 to 45) (p = 0.02). Among those treated successfully at first presentation, LDT was used for 28% of relapses in the EF group (95% CI 12 to 44) and 39% in the PF group (95% CI 19 to 59) (p>0.2) over the next year. CONCLUSION: PF did not effect adherence to LDT but was associated with significantly reduced need for nasogastric tube administration of formula.},

   abstract = {Genetic factors play a significant role in determining inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility. Epidemiologic data support genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of IBD, which include familial aggregation, twin studies, racial and ethnic differences in disease prevalence. Linkage studies have identified several susceptibility genes contained in different genomic regions named IBD1 to IBD9. Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are the most extensively studied genetic regions (IBD1 and IBD3 respectively) in IBD. Mutations of the NOD2 gene are associated with Crohn's disease (CD) and several HLA genes are associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) and CD. Toll like receptors (TLRs) have an important role in the innate immune response against infections by mediating recognition of pathogen-associated microbial patterns. Studying single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in molecules involved in bacterial recognition seems to be essential to define genetic backgrounds at risk of IBD. Recently, numerous new genes have been identified to be involved in the genetic susceptibility to IBD: NOD1/Caspase-activation recruitment domains 4 (CARD4), Chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), IL-11, and IL-18 among others. The characterization of these novel genes potentially will lead to the identification of therapeutic agents and clinical assessment of phenotype and prognosis in patients with IBD.},

NOD-like receptors have been implicated as ancient cellular sentinels mediating protective immune responses against intracellular pathogens. Recent studies have described the genetic association of polymorphisms in NOD-like receptor genes with complex chronic inflammatory barrier diseases, such as Crohn's disease and asthma and with rare auto-inflammatory syndromes including familial cold urticaria, Muckle-Wells syndrome and Blau syndrome. Whereas genetic variability in NLRs may have been an important element to provide plasticity to antigen recognition and host defense in the past, recent changes in the lifestyle of industrialized societies (e.g. hygiene ("cold-chain-hypothesis"), nutrition, or antibiotics) may have turned ancient genetic variability into disease-causing mutations.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Benign oesophageal strictures may occur as a complication of caustic ingestion or severe gastro-oesophageal reflux or as a sequela of oesophageal surgery and other fibrosing conditions. The traditional initial treatment of oesophageal strictures is intraluminal dilation; however, even if frequent, this occasionally may not provide adequate oesophageal lumen capacity or give significant symptom-free intervals, and restricturing after dilation is difficult and challenging. Topical postdilation application of an antifibrotic agent, mitomycin-C, in the treatment of an oesophageal stricture has been described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight centres participated, with a total of 16 patients (4 girls), median age 48 (range 0-276) months. The causes of stricture were as follows: caustic (10), post-trachea-oesophageal fistula repair (2), peptic (2), Crohn disease (1), and dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (1). The median (range) length and diameter of the strictures were as follows: 22 mm (8-50 mm) and 1.5 mm (1-6 mm). Of the 16 patients, 15 had undergone repeated dilations varying from 3 to more than 1000 (daily self-bouginage) before mitomycin-C, and the median interval between dilations was 4 weeks. Mitomycin-C 0.1 mg/mL was applied after dilation for a median time of 3.5 minutes and a median of 3 (1-12) times. RESULTS: Major success, both endoscopic and clinical improvement or cure, occurred in 10 of 16 patients. In 3 of 16 patients the interval period between dilations increased dramatically. Failure of therapy was considered in 3 of 16. All of the patients remained symptom free for a follow-up time of as long as 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Postdilation application of topical mitomycin-C resulted in major success in 62.5% of patients and partial success in 19%, and it may be a useful strategy in oesophageal strictures of differing causes that are refractory to repeated perendoscopic dilation.},

Recent research has added new insights into the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and treatment options for children with inflammatory bowel disease, and the findings will enable clinicians to develop a more rational approach to the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Population-based studies have confirmed the increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in children. Previous medical history and serologies can be predictive of complications in Crohn's disease. Newer radiological and capsule endoscopic modalities have a potential future role in the diagnosis and interval assessment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Biological therapies play an increasingly prominent role in the management of children with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Studies of children with inflammatory bowel disease suggest that behavioral interventions may have a positive impact on morbidity and overall quality of life. SUMMARY: New information concerning the natural history of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and a better understanding of different treatment modalities will enable the development of increasingly effective and individualized pharmacological treatment plans for children with inflammatory bowel disease.},

CD frequently presents during childhood, resulting in pediatric-specific complications, such as growth failure and delayed puberty. Conventional drug therapy for moderate to severe pediatric CD includes induction of remission with corticosteroids, and maintenance of remission with immunomodulators. Patients who have an inadequate response to standard therapy are being increasingly treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) agents. Infliximab has been the most widely studied anti-TNFalpha agent in pediatric CD, and has been shown to be efficacious in this condition. Adalimumab has been proven to be efficacious in adults with CD, but there has been only a single case report in children. CDP571 has been tested in 20 children with CD, showing some efficacy. Finally, thalidomide therapy has been associated with improvement in two small case series. Toxicities of these agents include infusion reactions, infections, malignancies, neurologic disorders, and hematologic derangements.},

   abstract = {Enteropathy defines abnormalities of the small intestinal mucosa, visible with the light microscope, of various etiologies, that can be separated into acute versus chronic conditions. This review focuses on these areas in which recent progress has been made. Severe infections increase mucosal permeability and induce local expression of co-stimulatory molecules allowing antigen penetration in the mucosa, T cell activation and possible disruption of oral tolerance. Biotherapeutics are of importance in the prevention and treatment of (chronic) enteropathy of infectious origin. Celiac disease and cow's milk protein allergy are key examples of chronic enteropathy. The dietary approach to allergy has evolved to include active stimulation of the immature immune system in order to support the establishment of tolerance. Supplementation with probiotics may provide maturational signals for the lymphoid tissue and improve the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Enteral polymeric feeding is effective in Crohn's disease. Dietary nucleotides may improve growth and immunity, optimize maturation, recovery and function of rapidly dividing tissue. Adequate dietary lipids are important not just for caloric value but also for immune-modulatory effects. Lipids may prevent allergic sensitization by downregulating inflammatory response (n-3 but not n-6 fatty acids) whilst protecting the epithelial barrier, regulating immune function and modifying the adherence of microbes to the mucosa, thereby contributing to host-microbe interactions.},

AIM: Characterize the nutritional and socioeconomic profile of patients hospitalized at the Pernambuco "Hospital das Clinicas", Recife, PE, Brazil. METHODS: Cross-sectional study carried out at the gastroenterology clinic, which was previously approved by the Ethics Commission for studies involving human beings. The methods included clinical history data, socioeconomic conditions and nutritional assessment. Data were subject to statistical analysis (Students t test for equal and unequal variables). RESULTS: The sample consisted of 24 male and female patients, with a mean age of 43.83 +/- 16.13 years, mostly married, coming from Recife, with low income, who lived in their own house with relatives. We found a higher prevalence of ulcerative proctocolitis (62.5%), with diagnosis time of more than 5 years, symptoms of abdominal pain, bloody-mucous diarrhea with 6-9 evacuations/day, with the distal colon being the most affected part. Osteoporosis was present in 26.7% of cases. Nutritional status was assessed through the body mass index. The weight loss percentage corresponded to 41.7% and 70.8%, respectively, classified as malnourished, associated or not with high prevalence levels of anemia, hypoalbuminemia and hypocalcemia. Gender correlation evidenced higher triceps fold and arm circumference values in men. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the study limitations, data suggest relevant information about the occurrence of these diseases in the northeast of Brazil, as well as about its frequent association with important nutritional deficiencies.},

   abstract = {Changes in diet greatly affect the mucosal immune system, particularly in diseases such as Crohn's disease and necrotizing enterocolitis. This article examines the hypothesis that alterations in the luminal environment of the intestine regulate the expression of genes in the enterocyte responsible for signaling to immune cells. Genes expressed by the epithelium orchestrate leukocytes in the lamina propria. For example, chemokine expression in the mouse intestinal epithelium, through transgenic means, induced the recruitment of neutrophils and lymphocytes into intestinal tissues. Diet alters the expression of the genes responsible for signaling by a variety of pathways. The introduction of a normal diet to a weanling mouse up-regulates MHC class II expression through a particular isoform of the class II transactivator, a protein that acts in the nucleus. SCFA concentrations in the intestinal lumen vary markedly with diet. SCFAs increase IL-8 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 expression by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity in the enterocyte. Down-regulation of gene expression by butyrate can act through acetylation of the inhibitory transcription factor Sp3. The review therefore describes a number of molecular pathways, explaining how changes in diet may alter leukocyte recruitment by regulating enterocyte gene expression. Myofibroblasts enhance enterocyte chemotactic activity by cleaving inactive precursors; and myofibroblast genes also are regulated by SCFA. It is likely that other similar regulatory mechanisms remain to be discovered.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical experience of our center of the use of infliximab in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all infliximab infusions administered in the Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit from October of 1999 to October of 2006. Fourteen patients (nine with Crohn's disease, three with ulcerative colitis, and two with indeterminate colitis) with a mean age of 9.6 years at diagnosis were treated with infliximab. Seventy-seven infusions were administered. RESULTS: Efficacy was analyzed according to inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn's disease: in severe cases (PCDAI > 30), clinical remission (PCDAI < 10) was obtained in 80 % of the patients at week 10, decreasing to 60 % at week 54. Corticosteroid therapy could be reduced in 89 % of the patients and was discontinued in 55.5 %. Ulcerative colitis: clinical remission (modified Truelove-Witts index < 10) was initially obtained in 100 % of the patients but only 33 % were still in clinical remission at the end of the study. In the two corticosteroid-dependent patients, corticosteroid therapy could be reduced and even discontinued in one (50 %). Indeterminate colitis: neither of the two patients achieved clinical remission. The most frequent adverse effects observed were acute infusional reactions (42.8 % of the patients and 10.3 % of infusions), one of which was severe, and infections (28.6 % of patients), one of which (ileal abscess) required surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of infliximab seems to differ considerably in the distinct types of inflammatory bowel disease and is practically null in indeterminate colitis. Randomized controlled studies in children are required to assess the exact efficacy of infliximab in our patients.},

Ecological treatments including probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are actively studied in Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis. We review herein the literature on the rational use of probiotics in IBD considering efficacy (as evaluated in randomized controlled trials), mechanisms of action and safety issues. A probiotic effect is strictly restricted to one defined strain and cannot be generalized from one to another. There is evidence of efficacy of some probiotic drugs in pouchitis (VSL#3), and in the prevention of recurrence of UC (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917). However, the evidence for efficacy of probiotic drugs in CD is still low as well as that of dietary ecological treatments. Despite an ecological (hopefully nutritional) treatment of IBD is promising, many questions remain unanswered and further clinical and fundamental studies are needed.},

   abstract = {Diarrhea continues to be a prevalent symptom in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), requiring a wide differential diagnosis to define the pathophysiologic mechanisms in individual patients. It is essential that physicians properly evaluate complaints of diarrhea by assessing both patient symptoms and potential physiologic impacts on fluid and electrolyte status. Underlying mechanisms of diarrhea with IBD are the location, extent, and severity of inflammation; malabsorption; altered motility; and iatrogenic causes such as medications, diet, and antibiotic-associated colitis (eg, Clostridium difficile). When treating diarrhea, physicians need to control inflammatory activity using appropriate treatment algorithms. Therapies include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immune modifiers, and, most recently, biologic treatment. Other medications, including loperamide, diphenoxylate, codeine sulfate, and tinctures of opium, slow motility and increase the absorption of fluids and nutrients. For iatrogenic issues, medications that cause diarrhea should be withdrawn and individual diets modified. Not all diarrheas in the IBD patient are the same; therefore, it is essential to tailor therapies according to presumed etiologies. Antidiarrheal agents are not recommended in extremely ill patients and those with known hypersensitivity or evidence of obstruction or colonic dilation, fever, or abdominal tenderness. Concomitant use of loperamide with diphenoxylate and atropine should be avoided in early pregnancy.},

Nevertheless, children with intractable FAP are occasionally referred to EGD to rule out intestinal pathology. We evaluated the role of wireless video capsule endoscopy (VCE) in children referred for EGD with a diagnosis of FAP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten children older than 10 years of age were prospectively enrolled. Children were first studied with the PillCam SB (VCE; Given Imaging, Yokneam, Israel) followed by standard EGD within 2 weeks. After the completion of the study, a questionnaire of tolerance and content regarding the 2 procedures was completed by the patients. RESULTS: Physical examinations and laboratory tests were within normal limits in all of the patients. Patients swallowed the endoscopic capsules without difficulty. There were no complications. VCE identified gastritis in 4 patients (confirmed by biopsies), whereas EGD detected erosive gastritis in only 1 of the 4 children. EGD detected no duodenal abnormalities. VCE detected Crohn disease in the small intestine and cecum in 1 patient. VCE was ranked by 8 patients as convenient and as a preferable procedure compared with EGD. CONCLUSION: The results of this small cohort suggest that in children with FAP, VCE is more sensitive than EGD for detection of macroscopic gastric and small bowel pathologies.},

It can occur in a significant proportion of patients, and may precede clinical evidence of bowel disease. Current evidence suggests that GR is a complex interaction between nutritional status, inflammation, disease severity, and genotype, which causes resistance to the effects of growth hormone. Recent research has identified a key role for the inflammatory cytokines TNF alpha, IL-6, and IL1 beta. This review summarizes current knowledge as well as gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms involved and the usefulness of the different treatment modalities in promoting growth in CD patients.},

We applied proteome analysis (PA) to characterize changes in the protein expression profile of primary IEC from patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Surgical specimens from 18 patients with active CD (N = 6), UC (N = 6), and colonic cancer (N = 6) were used to purify primary IEC from ileal and colonic tissues. Changes in protein expression were identified using 2D-gel electrophoreses (2D SDS-PAGE) and peptide mass fingerprinting via MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) as well as Western blot analysis. PA of primary IEC from inflamed ileal tissue of CD patients and colonic tissue of UC patients identified 21 protein spots with at least 2-fold changes in steady-state expression levels compared to the noninflamed tissue of control patients. Statistical significance was achieved for 9 proteins including the Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor alpha that was up-regulated in CD and UC patients. Additionally, 40 proteins with significantly altered expression levels were identified in IEC from inflamed compared to noninflamed tissue regions of single UC (N = 2) patients. The most significant change was detected for programmed cell death protein 8 (7.4-fold increase) and annexin 2A (7.7-fold increase). PA in primary IEC from IBD patients revealed significant expression changes of proteins that are associated with signal transduction, stress response as well as energy metabolism. The induction of Rho GDI alpha expression may be associated with the destruction of IEC homeostasis under condition of chronic intestinal inflammation.},

The control of lactose digestion phenotypically divides populations into those who can [lactase persistent (LP)] and those who cannot [lactase nonpersistent (LNP)] assimilate lactose. LNP subjects, however, can adapt to lactose intolerance through intestinal bacteria. The DF/LNP status interactions may function as disease risk modifiers. We evaluated the relationship between DF and LNP with colorectal, breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, and stomach cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD; Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). Yearly per capita DF consumption, LNP national prevalence, cancer mortality, and incidence of IBD were obtained from several sources. A negative binomial regression model was used to derive incremental risks. There were statistically significant (P <or= 0.05) increases in risk for colorectal and prostate cancer and ulcerative colitis with DFs and a statistically significant decreased risk for stomach cancer. There were trends (P<0.1) for lung and ovarian cancers and Crohn's disease. As LNP prevalence increased, stomach cancer risk increased, whereas risks of all other conditions decreased (P<0.01). In 3 cancers (prostate, ovarian, and breast), meta-analyses of case-based studies support ecological data. In colorectal cancer, on the contrary, meta-analyses of case-based studies suggest protection. The possible importance of distinguishing LNP/LP status in studies is discussed.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are associated with extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) in approximately 40% of patients. Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha, is effective for induction and maintenance of remission of CD and UC. The role of infliximab for EIMs related to IBD has been less studied, but it is likely as effective. The EIMs may run a course that parallels IBD activity or may present separately. The EIMs that parallel intestinal inflammation (eg, peripheral arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, and episcleritis) generally respond to infliximab. Therefore, treating patients with IBD who have one of these EIMs will more often than not improve the EIM. The EIMs that run a separate course from IBD are more difficult to treat. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) have variable responses to IBD medications. Infliximab is efficacious for uveitis and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AS. The efficacy of infliximab for PSC is unknown. The dosing schedule of infliximab for IBD patients with EIMs should be induction doses with 5 mg/kg at 0, 2, and 6 weeks followed by every 8 weeks. Whether long-term infliximab therapy is necessary to maintain remission of EIMs, as in the case of IBD, has not been established.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha plays a role in the inflammatory process in Crohn disease, a disease with an apparent polygenic basis. We investigated whether polymorphisms in multiple genes involved in the lipopolysaccharide-TNF inflammatory pathway are independently associated with Crohn disease in the Jewish Ashkenazi population. Polymorphisms in CD14, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and TNF-alpha were studied. In addition, we investigated polymorphisms in the TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) gene, which to date has not been studied for an association with Crohn disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To examine whether TLR4 Asp299Gly, CD14-260C/T, TNF-1031T/C, TNF-863C/A, TNF-857C/T, TACE-172C/T, and TACE-154C/A polymorphisms are associated with Crohn disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, we analyzed families with at least 1 child with Crohn disease for association with these mutations using a family-based association test (transmission disequilibrium test) for analysis. RESULTS: The allelic frequency in the patient population of TLR4 G allele was 8.0%, CD14 T allele was 51.3%, TNF-1031C was 18.8%, TNF-863A was 14.2%, TNF-857T was 25.2%, TACE172T was 20.7%, and TACE154A was 24.5%. The transmission disequilibrium test transmitted:untransmitted (T:U) result for TLR4G was T:U = 32:20, for CD14T was T:U = 103:88, for TNF-1031C was T:U = 48:56, for TNF-863A was T:U = 39:42, for TNF-857T was T:U = 63:62, for TACE-172C/T was T:U = 48:59, and for TACE-154C/A was T:U = 52:55. No statistically significant associations were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The transmission disequilibrium test did not demonstrate preferential transmission of these variants in Jewish Ashkenazi patients with Crohn disease. These results suggest that these polymorphisms in the TNF/lipopolysaccharide pathway play little or no role in susceptibility to Crohn disease in the Jewish Ashkenazi population.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Colectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is a potentially curative option for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). A rare, postoperative complication is terminal ileitis which has been poorly documented in paediatric patients. A search of our paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) database revealed two boys with UC who were resistant to medical therapy. They each underwent colectomy with IPAA. One year later, both children represented with bloody diarrhoea and weight loss. Several endoscopies and biopsies showed acute on chronic mucosal inflammation in the pouch and up to 50 cm into the terminal ileum (TI). Biopsies revealed mixed inflammatory infiltrate with no granulomas. CONCLUSION: Development of terminal ileitis after colectomy and IPAA can occur in children with UC. Although every effort should be made to exclude Crohn's disease as a cause of the terminal ileitis, this poorly defined condition should not be considered to be against the diagnosis of UC. More research is needed to develop a better understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of this uncommon condition.},

METHODS: A total of 78 CD patients and 80 healthy controls were evaluated in respect of nutritional status, dietary intake, and life styles factors. RESULTS: These 73/78 CD patients were on immunomodulating therapies. Mean body mass index (BMI) was lower in patients as compared to controls (P= 0.006) but 32% of CD patients and 33.8% of controls had a BMI > 25, whereas 8% and 23.8% in each group, respectively, were obese (BMI > 30Kg/m(2)). Fat free mass was significantly decreased in both genders (P < 0.05) whereas fat mass was decreased only in males (P= 0.01). Energy intake was significantly lower in CD patients (P < 0.0001) and we observed significantly lower adjusted mean daily intakes of carbohydrates, monounsaturated fat, fiber, calcium, and vitamins C, D, E, and K (P < 0.05). 29% of patients had excluded grains from their usual diet, 28% milk, 18% vegetables, and 11% fruits. Milk exclusion resulted in a significantly lower consumption of calcium and vitamin K (P < 0.001) and the exclusion of vegetables was associated to a lower consumption of vitamins C and E (P < 0.05). Physical activity was significantly lower in CD patients (P= 0.01) and this lack of physical activity was inversely correlated with increased fat mass percentage (r=-0.315, P= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that the most prevalent form of malnutrition in CD patients was an excess of body weight, which was concomitant with an inadequate dietary intake, namely micronutrients, clearly related to dietary exclusion of certain foods.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Many IBD patients not responding to azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) preferentially metabolize 6-MP to 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP). We describe the use of allopurinol in AZA/6-MP nonresponders to deliberately shunt metabolism of 6-MP toward 6-thioguanine (6-TGN) and improve clinical responses. METHODS: Twenty outpatients who were AZA/6-MP nonresponders and had high 6-MMP metabolite levels were included. Subjects were commenced on allopurinol 100 mg daily, and the dose of 6-MP/AZA was reduced to 25%-50% of the original dose. RESULTS: After allopurinol was started, mean 6-TGN levels increased from 191.3 (+/- standard error of the mean) +/- 17.1 to 400.3 +/- 36.9 pmol/8 x 10(8) red blood cells (P < .001), whereas mean 6-MMP levels decreased from 10,604.7 +/- 1278.2 to 2000.6 +/- 437.1 pmol/8 x 10(8) red blood cells (P < .001). The addition of allopurinol led to a reduction in the mean partial Harvey Bradshaw Index in Crohn's disease patients from 4.9 +/- 1.0 to 1.5 +/- 0.3 points (P = .001), and in ulcerative colitis patients mean Mayo Scores decreased from 4.1 +/- 0.7 to 2.9 +/- 0.7 points (P = .13). The addition of allopurinol enabled a reduction in mean daily prednisone dosage from 17.6 +/- 3.9 to 1.8 +/- 0.7 mg (P < .001) and led to normalization of transaminase levels, with mean AST levels reducing from 42.5 +/- 8.1 to 23.5 +/- 1.6 IU (P = .12) and mean ALT levels reducing from 101.6 +/- 26.9 to 33.9 +/- 5.2 IU (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of allopurinol to thiopurine nonresponders with high 6-MMP metabolite levels is an effective and safe means of optimizing 6-TGN production, leading to improved disease activity scores, reduced corticosteroid requirements, and normalization of liver enzymes.},

   abstract = {Unexplained diarrhoea is a frequent indication for gastroenterologic referral, and after full investigation the most common final diagnosis is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Some patients with IBS describe an acute onset of symptoms following infective gastroenteritis. Postinfective IBS affects 7% to 31% of individuals infected, and appears to be a nonspecific response to injury which has been reported following Salmonella-, Campylobacter-, and Shigella-related IBS. The strongest risk factor for developing postinfective IBS is severity of the initial diarrhoea illness, but toxigenicity of the infected bacteria, age <60 years, and female sex also are important risk factors. Adverse life events, hypochondriasis, and depression are also important, as is increased enteroendocrine cell and lymphocyte numbers in rectal biopsies. Postinfective IBS and IBS with diarrhoea without an infectious onset both show increased postprandial release of serotonin, whilst constipated patients show a depressed release. Several studies suggest impairment of the serotonin transporter in IBS, which in animal studies has been shown to occur following a range of inflammatory insults. Clinical conditions with an inflammatory basis, such as coeliac and Crohn disease, also are characterised by excess postprandial serotonin release. Several studies report evidence of low-grade inflammation in IBS with diarrhoea. However, reliable markers of low-grade inflammation that may predict response to serotonin antagonists or other anti-inflammatory agents remain a goal for future research.},

   abstract = {The normal colonic microflora is intimately involved in the aetiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). These conditions are often refractile to conventional treatments involving the employment of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drugs, and this has led to a search for alternative therapies based on the use of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. The majority of investigations in this area have been done with probiotics, and while there is increasing interest in the abilities of prebiotics and synbiotics to control the symptoms of IBD, very few randomised controlled trials have been reported. Although the results have been variable, human and animal studies have demonstrated that in many circumstances, these functional foods can alter the composition of the colonic microbiota, reduce inflammatory processes in the gut mucosa, and have the potential to induce disease remission. More work is needed to understand the effects of prebiotics and synbiotics on microbial communities in the gut, and their interactions with the host's immune system.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) may contribute to the alterations in protein and energy metabolism present in children with Crohn's disease (CD), who frequently suffer from growth disturbance. We hypothesized that anti-TNF-alpha therapy would reduce protein losses, due to decreased proteolysis and increased protein synthesis, and that anti-TNF-alpha therapy would decrease resting energy expenditure. METHODS: Children with active CD underwent metabolic assessment immediately before and 2 weeks following initial infliximab infusion. Using the stable isotopes [d5] phenylalanine and [1-13C] leucine, 2 independent measures of protein metabolism were determined during fasting and in response to parenteral nutrition. Energy expenditure, determined by indirect calorimetry, was measured in fasting and parenterally fed states. RESULTS: Fifteen children completed the study. Following infliximab therapy, significant reductions in proteolysis (P < 0.05) were noted in the fasting state (8%-11%) and during parenteral nutrition infusion (10%-12%). Phenylalanine utilization for protein synthesis decreased significantly (8%-13%) following infliximab (P < 0.05). Protein balance was not significantly altered. No significant changes in energy expenditure were observed following infliximab in fasting or parenterally fed states. Supplementation with parenteral nutrition resulted in significantly decreased proteolysis (8%-21%; P < 0.05), increased protein synthesis (37%-45%; P < 0.01), and improved protein balance (P < 0.01) compared to the fasting state. CONCLUSIONS: Following the initial infliximab infusion in children with CD, proteolysis and protein synthesis were significantly reduced in the fasting and parenterally fed states. Supplementation with parenteral nutrition resulted in significant improvements in protein metabolism compared to the fasting state both before and after infliximab therapy.},

There is no information concerning insulin resistance and substrate metabolism in children with Crohn's disease after anti-TNF-alpha therapy. Our aim was to describe changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in children with active Crohn's disease after their initial dose of infliximab. Children with active Crohn's disease underwent measurement of plasma insulin and glucose just before and 2 wk after their initial infusion of infliximab, an anti-TNF-alpha antibody. In addition, resting energy expenditure, with determination of both carbohydrate and lipid oxidation rates, was determined. Measurements were conducted in both fasting and parenterally fed states. Despite no changes in resting energy expenditure, a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in RQ (5%) and carbohydrate oxidation rate (24%), with a corresponding increase in lipid oxidation rate (42%) was found during parenteral nutrition infusion. No differences in plasma insulin, glucose, and insulin resistance were noted when comparing pre- and postinfliximab measurements.},

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of anti-TNF-alpha therapy on albumin and fibrinogen synthesis during both fasting and parenteral nutrition infusion in pediatric patients with active Crohn disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with active Crohn disease scheduled for their initial dose of infliximab underwent assessment immediately before and 2 weeks following infliximab infusion. Using the stable isotope [d5] phenylalanine, rates of fractional and absolute albumin and fibrinogen synthesis were calculated. Measurements were made in both the fasting and parenterally fed states. RESULTS: Fifteen children (mean age 14.9 +/- 0.3) completed the study. The mean serum albumin changed from 3.59 +/- 0.08 to 3.66 +/- 0.04 g/dL, and the mean fibrinogen level decreased from 230 +/- 17 to 187 +/- 8 mg/dL (P < 0.05) following infliximab therapy. During fasting, there were no changes in albumin and fibrinogen synthesis rates following infliximab. During parenteral nutrition infusion, the fractional albumin synthesis rate changed from 11.8% to 15.1%/day (P = 0.06), and the absolute albumin synthesis rate increased from 192 to 248 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) (P < 0.05), whereas no changes in fibrinogen synthesis rates were observed. Synthesis rates of albumin and fibrinogen were increased during parenteral nutrition infusion compared with the fasting state. CONCLUSIONS: Following infliximab therapy, during parenteral nutrition infusion, albumin synthesis increased significantly. Conversely, serum fibrinogen levels decreased following infliximab therapy in the absence of significant change in synthesis rates.},

Abundant literature is devoted to mechanisms by which curcumin may mediate this activity. These insights have prompted investigations in which curcumin as lead molecule serves as a scaffold for synthetic chemical attempts to optimize pharmacological potency. Among the published analogues with notable efficacy are dimethylcurcumin, 1,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,4-pentadien-3-one and 3,5-bis-(2-fluorobenzylidene)-piperidinium-4-one acetate. Results of a small number of clinical pilot studies conducted with curcumin at doses of up to 12 g suggest tentatively that it is safe in humans. Prevention of adenoma recurrence constitutes a clinical paradigm worthy of further investigation for curcumin. Future clinical study should include measurement of mechanism-based pharmacodynamic parameters.},

These endothelin system components are considered to participate in inflammatory and wound healing responses. Previous reports have suggested a role for the endothelin-1 in the pathology of Crohn's disease. In the present study, we immunohistochemically investigated the expressions of the endothelin system components in affected human intestinal tissues of Crohn's disease. Eighteen surgical specimens of colonic tissue obtained from patients with Crohn's disease and 12 normal colonic tissues as controls were examined. Frozen tissue sections cut from the samples were subjected to the immunohistochemical single and double staining. The endothelin system components were expressed mainly in the muscular layers and blood vessels. In diseased colonic tissues, inflammatory infiltration and fibrotic tissue reactions with marked smooth muscle cell proliferation were frequently seen, and were closely associated with increased expressions of the endothelin system components. These results strongly suggest that endothelin-converting enzyme and endothelin type A and type B receptors collectively play a role in the inflammatory and fibrogenic processes of Crohn's disease. Especially, submucosal smooth muscle proliferation, a histological hallmark of strictures, may be attributable to the upregulated endothelin system.},

METHODS: Antibody to porcine pancreatic amylase (PPA) a protease-resistant dietary protein (anti-PPA), was examined in CD patients (N = 104), ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (N = 85), and healthy controls (N = 83), and its relationship with the clinical characteristics of CD was investigated. Antibodies to casein and ovalbumin, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), and antibodies to I2 from Pseudomonas fluorescens (anti-I2) were also examined. RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent (39/104) of the CD patients expressed anti-PPA antibodies, and this percentage was significantly higher as compared with the control group (5%, 4/83) and the UC group (9%, 8/85) (P < 0.001). A significantly higher level of anti-PPA antibodies was detected in patients with "small bowel disease-dominant" CD than in those with "colitis-dominant" CD (P < 0.05). Antibodies to casein and ovalbumin were not specifically expressed in CD patients. As ASCA was detected in 33% and anti-I2 in 46% of the CD patients, 72% of the CD patients were found positive for at least one of the three antibodies including anti-PPA antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients showed a specific antibody response to PPA, as compared with UC patients and controls. There was a significantly higher level of anti-PPA antibody in patients with "small bowel disease-dominant" CD, suggesting that dietary proteins could play a role in the inflammatory response in CD patients with small bowel disease. Anti-PPA antibodies combined with ASCA/anti-I2 may be useful for the diagnosis of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) it is not known whether reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) are a consequence of bone turnover alterations and if BMD improves with treatment. METHODS: In a cohort of children with IBD, we prospectively measured indicators of bone remodeling, body mass index (BMI), disease activity, intact parathyroid hormone, serum IL-6, and insulin-like growth factor-I at diagnosis and then every 6 months for 2 years. BMD was determined annually using dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). BMD Z-scores were calculated using height/age. Baseline measurements and calcium intake were compared with a group of age- and sex-matched healthy children. RESULTS: We observed that at diagnosis total body BMD Z-score (mean +/- SD) was -0.78 +/- 1.02 for Crohn's disease (CD, n = 58), -0.46 +/- 1.14 for ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 18), and -0.17 +/- 0.95 for control (CL, n = 49) (P < 0.01, CD versus CL). In CD, a BMD Z-score <-1.0 was associated with lower BMI and higher serum IL-6. Patients with CD and UC had low bone turnover. Activation of bone formation paralleled clinical improvement, but BMC gain was less than expected over the 2-year study period, especially in CD. Prednisone use did not correlate with low BMD. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased bone turnover occurs in children newly diagnosed with IBD. Although indicators of osteoblast activity increase with clinical improvement, bone mineral accrual does not accelerate. Children with low BMI may be considered for BMD screening, since they are at risk for low bone mass.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Enterostomy is often undergone by patients with Crohn's disease (CD) due to severe anorectal lesions such as rectovaginal fistula (RVF). Reports of successful pregnancy and delivery, which are important determinants of quality of life for female CD patients with stoma, are limited. Thus, we investigated problems associated with pregnancy and delivery in female CD patients at our hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1985 and 2003, five female CD patients with enterostoma carried seven pregnancies and delivered eight babies in our hospital. For this study, we investigated CD activity, fetal growth, stoma complications, and the outcome of delivery in these seven pregnancies. RESULTS: Among the five patients, four underwent loop ileostomy and one loop sigmoidostomy for treatment of RVF or severe stricture of the rectum or sigmoid colon. Except for one case, no fertility treatment was done. During pregnancy, a flare-up was observed in one patient and was successfully treated with corticosteroids. Although home enteral or parenteral nutrition was required in two cases, fetal growth was within the normal range in all pregnancies. Preterm delivery occurred in one case with a twin pregnancy. The mean diameter of stoma increased during pregnancy (p<0.01), and a mucosal laceration of stoma by the edge of an ostomy appliance occurred in one case. All deliveries were safe, with six cesarean sections and one transvaginal delivery. After each delivery, the stoma returned to pre-pregnancy size. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy and delivery in CD patients with stoma is safe and should be encouraged. However, special attention to disease activity, nutritional support, and stoma-related complications is recommended.},

A 1-year prospective study of 76 patients with Crohn disease was conducted. The criterion for eligibility was a Crohn Disease Activity Index score of 150 or lower for at least 1 month. The primary end point was defined as the relapse-free interval from the baseline until the first relapse. Fat intake was assessed using a validated diet history questionnaire. The degree of dietary temperance was assessed using a single-item nominal scale. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the influence of diet. Crohn disease relapse was seen in 25 patients (33%), and 47 patients (62%) remained in continuous remission. A decreased ratio of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) to n-3PUFA (odds ratio = .38; p = .005) was associated with a poor prognosis. Dietary temperance also was significantly associated with prognosis (p = .014). More moderate dietary temperance decreased the risk of relapse (odds ratio = .22; p = .006). Effective prevention of relapse for Crohn disease patients might be achieved through moderate dietary temperance, particularly when the disease condition is unstable.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with altered bone metabolism. This study examined changes in bone formation and resorption after infliximab induction and associations between bone biomarkers, linear growth, and disease activity (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI]) after 54 weeks of infliximab therapy. METHODS: One hundred twelve subjects ages 6-17 years with moderate to severe CD received infliximab induction (5 mg/kg/dose) at weeks 0, 2, and 6; week-10 responders were randomized to infliximab every 8 or every 12 weeks maintenance therapy. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP), urine C-telopeptide of collagen cross-links (CTX-1), and deoxypyrodinoline (DPD) were collected at baseline and 10 weeks. PCDAI and height z-scores were assessed at baseline and at 10 and 54 weeks. RESULTS: Models were adjusted for bone age, gender, height, and steroid use. Baseline BSAP and P1NP levels were negatively associated with PCDAI (both P = .01). BSAP and P1NP increased during induction (both P < .001) and were associated with 54-week increases in height z-score (P < .05 and P < .001, respectively). Improvements in P1NP were associated with 54-week decreases in PCDAI (P = .01). CTX-1 and DPD also increased during induction (P < .001 and P = .01, respectively) but were not associated with changes in PCDAI. Changes in CTX-1 were associated with improvements in height z-score (P < .002). CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab therapy is associated with dramatic increases in BSAP and P1NP, consistent with inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha effects on osteoblasts. The increases in CTX-1 and DPD likely reflect coupling of bone formation and resorption and increases in linear growth.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Childhood Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with poor growth and decreased body mass index (BMI); however, lean mass (LM) and fat mass (FM) deficits prior to therapy have not been characterized. OBJECTIVES: To quantify LM and FM in incident pediatric CD subjects and controls, and to identify determinants of LM and FM deficits. METHODS: Whole body LM and FM were assessed using DXA in 78 CD subjects and 669 healthy controls, ages 5-21 yr. Gender specific z-scores for LM (LM-Ht) and FM (FM-Ht) relative to height were derived using log linear regression models in the controls. Multivariate linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: CD was associated with significantly lower height and BMI for age. Within CD subjects, FM-Ht and LM-Ht were significantly lower in females compared with males (FM-Ht z: -0.66+/-0.83 vs. -0.08+/-0.95, p<0.01; LM-Ht z: -1.12+/-1.12 vs. -0.57+/-0.99, p<0.05). In females, CD was associated with significantly lower LM-Ht (p<0.001) and FM-Ht (p=0.001), adjusted for age, race and Tanner stage, compared with controls. LM and FM deficits were significantly greater in older females with CD; 47% of adolescent females had LM-Ht<or=5th percentile. In non-black males, CD was also associated with lower LM-Ht (p<0.02); FM-Ht deficits were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Incident CD was associated with significant LM deficits in males and females, and FM deficits in females. Future studies are needed to identify etiologies for the age and gender differences and to evaluate therapies for these deficits.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Small bowel disease in the paediatric population is varied and to date has relied on indirect l modalities such as small bowel follow-through with attendant radiation exposure. Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) has the potential to provide a safer and more effective means of investigating the paediatric small bowel. The aim of our study was to prospectively assess the diagnostic yield of WCE compared with standard investigation in children with suspected small bowel disease. METHODS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients, median age 12.5 y (range, 9.4-15.9) with suspected small bowel disease were investigated with WCE. This included 16 patients with suspected small bowel Crohn disease (CD) (10 newly diagnosed; 6 known cases), 6 with obscure or occult gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), 3 with Peutz-Jegher polyposis (PJP), 2 with protein-losing enteropathy and 1 with recurrent abdominal pain. All of the patients had preceding upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (OGD) and ileocolonoscopy, and 24 had a barium meal and follow-through (BMFT). Images were downloaded and analysed and results compared with the endoscopic and radiological findings. RESULTS: Three patients were unable to swallow the capsule (1 CD, 1 PJP and 1 GIB). Two of these patients (1 GIB, 1 PJP) had the capsule placed in the stomach endoscopically and completed the WCE uneventfully thereafter. In 3 patients (CD group) the capsule remained in the stomach and/or proximal duodenum and no small bowel images were obtained. Hence, 24 patients had successful completion of the WCE through the small bowel, 23 of whom had clinically relevant findings identified. In all patients with CD who had successful WCE studies (12/16), small bowel disease was identified (11/12 active disease, 1/12 chronic disease). A possible small bowel bleeding source was identified in all 6 patients with GIB. Two patients with GIB also underwent push enteroscopy and 1 of these had a bleeding source identified. The 2 patients with protein-losing enteropathy had extensive patchy lymphangiectasia of the jejunum and ileum, not detected at OGD. The patient with abdominal pain had an intussusception of the upper jejunum. The 2 PJP patients had small bowel polyps identified, which were not detected at BMFT. WCE was more sensitive for small bowel pathology than both BMFT (19 vs 5; 26% sensitivity compared with WCE) and endoscopic investigations (23 vs 10; 43.4% sensitivity compared with WCE). Two patients with CD had delayed capsule transit. CONCLUSIONS: WCE led to a positive alteration in management in 18/24 (75%) of patients whose small bowel was examined by WCE and in 18/28 (64.3%) who were admitted to the study. WCE was safe, well tolerated, and more sensitive than radiological and standard endoscopic modalities in the detection of small bowel CD distribution, GIB source, and presence of polyps in children.},

We aimed (i) to phenotype these intestinal pigment cells (PC) in archival tissue specimens and (ii) to establish whether PC phenotype is altered in inflammatory conditions, especially Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: PCs contained within PP were identified by routine haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and dark field microscopy of archival ileal sections for: adenocarcinoma (n=16), colonic CD (n=23), non-CD colitis (n=10). Paraffin-embedded serial sections were graded for microscopic inflammation and then investigated immunohistochemically with antibodies against CD68, MAC387, CD14, CD11b, CD15, CD1a, S100, HLA-DR, CD86 and Cathepsin D. Analyses were by light and confocal microscopies. RESULTS: The majority of PCs were CD68 positive (circa 80%) with a minority (circa 20%) staining for MAC387. Microparticles were mainly identified within cathepsin D negative lysosomal compartments. Histological inflammatory grade and disease type had no influence on cell phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The microparticle-containing PCs of the PP base are mainly mature macrophages (CD68) of low metabolic and immunological activity. There is no evidence of differential PC phenotype or activation in differing disease states, including CD.},

Although the recent Montreal classification system allowed classification of upper GI involvement in Crohn's disease (CD), independent of other locations, a consensus regarding the definition of what qualifies as significant "involvement" is still lacking. Reported incidence data vary considerably depending on the definitions used and the selected target population. Pediatric data suggest that upper endoscopy is useful in differentiating CD from ulcerative colitis, when inflammation is otherwise predominantly confined to the colon; however, this question has yet to be studied in adults. Infliximab therapy for upper GI-CD seems as effective as that seen for more distal GI inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The thiopurines, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, are traditional first-line immunomodulatory agents in adult and pediatric Crohn's disease, but the comparative efficacy and safety of methotrexate have seldom been examined. We report outcomes with methotrexate treatment in pediatric patients previously refractory to or intolerant of thiopurines. METHODS: In a four-center, retrospective cohort study, efficacy of methotrexate in maintaining remission was assessed by PCDAI measurements, steroid use, and height velocity. Patients served as their own historical controls. Multivariable analysis controlled for route of methotrexate administration, reason for thiopurine discontinuation, baseline disease activity, and disease duration. RESULTS: Forty-two percent of 60 children treated with methotrexate were in clinical remission without steroids at both 6 and 12 months. A strong steroid sparing effect was observed compared with the year prior to methotrexate (P<0.001). Success rates were similar in previously thiopurine-intolerant and refractory patients. Height velocity increased from -1.9 SDS to -0.14 SDS (P=0.004) in the year following therapy. In a median 3-yr follow-up, a third of the patients did not require escalation of therapy; the others required step-up therapy with infliximab or surgery. Eight children (13%) stopped methotrexate due to adverse events, including, most commonly, elevated liver enzymes, and one serious episode of sepsis. CONCLUSION: Methotrexate appears effective in maintaining remission in pediatric Crohn's disease, when thiopurines have failed. Consideration should be given to its use earlier in pediatric treatment algorithms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The anti-inflammatory effects of n-3 (omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil) have been suggested to be beneficial in chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the efficacy and safety of n-3 for maintaining remission in Crohn's disease (CD). SEARCH STRATEGY: The following databases were searched from their inception without language restriction: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Healthstar, PubMed, and ACP journal club. Experts were contacted for unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) of n-3 for maintenance of remission in CD were included. Studies must have enrolled patients of any age group, who were in remission at the time of recruitment, and were followed for at least six months. The intervention must have been fish oil or n-3 given in pre-defined dosage. Co-interventions were allowed only if they were balanced between the study groups. The primary outcome was relapse rate and secondary outcomes were change in disease activity scores, time to first relapse and adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality using Jadad's criteria. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 4.2 software, weighted by the Mantel-Haenszel method. Random or fixed effect models were used according to degree of heterogeneity and subgroup analyses were performed to address heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: Four studies were eligible for inclusion. There was a non statistically significant benefit of n-3 therapy for maintaining remission (RR 0.64; 95%CI 0.4 to 1.03; P = 0.07). However, the studies were both clinically and statistically heterogeneous (P = 0.01, I(2) = 72%). Three studies used enteric coated capsules (positive effects) and one ordinary gelatin capsules (no advantage). Subgroup analyses of studies which used enteric coated capsules revealed a statistically significant benefit for maintenance of remission (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.69; RD 0.31; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.43); number needed to treat to prevent relapse in 1 year was 3 (95% CI 2 to 5; I(2) = 19%). However, the total number of patients enrolled in these studies was small (n = 166). No significant adverse events were recorded in any of the studies and not enough data were available to analyze the other secondary outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Omega 3 fatty acids are safe and may be effective for maintenance of remission in CD when used in enteric coated capsules. However, there are not sufficient data to recommend the routine use of n-3 for maintenance of remission in CD. The small number of patients in the included studies warrants further larger RCTs.},

The immune response and inflammation are mediated by polyunsaturated fatty acids and influenced by dietary fats and lipid metabolism. This study examined the qualitative and quantitative fat intake of IBD patients and healthy controls on plasma phospholipid and erythrocyte membrane phospholipid (EMP) fatty acid content. Measurement of the fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipid and EMP were performed in 29 UC patients, 20 CD patients, and 31 healthy controls. Anthropometric characteristics and data on dietary intake were also collected. We observed significantly lower lipid intake in UC and CD patients vs controls. The UC and CD patients had significantly higher levels of linoleic acid in their EMP than did controls. There were no significant differences in the levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but there were significantly higher levels of the n-6 in the EMP of UC and CD patients compared with controls. The significant differences persisted after the data were adjusted for potential confounders and lipid intake. Higher levels of linoleic acids and n-6 fatty acids, which are involved in production of proinflammatory mediators, were found in IBD patients compared with controls, thereby implicating n-6 fatty acids in the pathophysiology of the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This prospective, controlled, and multicentric study evaluated nutritional status, body composition, muscle strength, and quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in clinical remission. In addition, possible effects of gender, malnutrition, inflammation, and previous prednisolone therapy were investigated. METHODS: Nutritional status (subjective global assessment [SGA], body mass index, albumin, trace elements), body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis, anthropometry), handgrip strength, and quality of life were assessed in 94 patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 61 female and 33 male, Crohn's Disease Activity Index 71 +/- 47), 50 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; 33 female and 17 male, Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index 3.1 +/- 1.5), and 61 healthy control subjects (41 female and 20 male) from centers in Berlin, Vienna, and Bari. For further analysis of body composition, 47 well-nourished patients with inflammatory bowel disease were pair-matched by body mass index, sex, and age to healthy controls. Data are presented as median (25th-75th percentile). RESULTS: Most patients with inflammatory bowel disease (74%) were well nourished according to the SGA, body mass index, and serum albumin. However, body composition analysis demonstrated a decrease in body cell mass (BCM) in patients with CD (23.1 kg, 20.8-28.7, P = 0.021) and UC (22.6 kg, 21.0-28.0, P = 0.041) compared with controls (25.0 kg, 22.0-32.5). Handgrip strength correlated with BCM (r = 0.703, P = 0.001) and was decreased in patients with CD (32.8 kg, 26.0-41.1, P = 0.005) and UC (31.0 kg, 27.3-37.8, P = 0.001) compared with controls (36.0 kg, 31.0-52.0). The alterations were seen even in patients classified as well nourished. BCM was lower in patients with moderately increased serum C-reactive protein levels compared with patients with normal levels. CONCLUSION: In CD and UC, selected micronutrient deficits and loss of BCM and muscle strength are frequent in remission and cannot be detected by standard malnutrition screening.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Adipokines are fat-derived hormones and cytokines with immune-modulating and metabolic properties. Most of them are associated with insulin resistance. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate circulating levels of adipokines and glucose homeostasis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to evaluate possible associations with the course and characteristics of the disease. METHODS: Serum leptin, resistin, visfatin, retinol-binding protein-4, adiponectin, glucose, insulin, and inflammatory parameters were analyzed in 93 patients with inactive IBD (49 with Crohn's disease [CD], 44 with ulcerative colitis [UC]), 35 patients with active IBD (18 with CD, 17 with UC), and 37 age- and body mass index-matched healthy controls. Ninety-two patients were followed for 6 mo. RESULTS: Leptin was similar in patients with IBD and controls, whereas resistin and visfatin were increased in patients with active disease but not in those in remission. In active and inactive disease, adiponectin was decreased (P < 0.001) and retinol-binding protein-4 was increased (P < 0.001) compared with controls. About 60% of patients with IBD showed increased levels of insulin, whereas serum glucose remained normal, resulting in increased homeostasis model assessment values in most patients. Hyperinsulinemia was associated with the decrease in adiponectin (r = -0.572, P < 0.001) and proved to be an independent protective factor for 6-mo maintenance of remission (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: IBD led to largely similar alterations in circulating adipokines and hyperinsulinemia in patients with CD and those with UC. The unexpected protective effect of hyperinsulinemia on relapse rate denotes the role of the metabolic-inflammatory response as a modulator in IBD.},

OBJECTIVE: To know how task perceptions, perceptions of own ability and perceived barriers regarding nutrition education and treatment of overweight of Dutch GPs have developed from 1992 to 2007. METHODS: In all, 488 GPs, first included in study in 1992, were asked in 2007 to return the Wageningen PCPs Nutritional Practices Questionnaire. Crohnbach's alphas and sum scores were calculated and differences between 1992 and 2007 were investigated using a paired t-test. RESULTS: In all, 247 GPs responded (51%). 'Noticing patients overweight and guidance of treatment' did not change in GPs from 1992 to 2007. The task perception about health education and prevention did not change and the perception of daily activities shifted from the curative to the preventive side. Interest in the influence of nutrition on health increased in 2007. GPs less often managed to counsel on nutrition in daily practice. Their perceived capacity to counsel and their self-efficacy regarding overweight management declined over the years. In 2007, more GPs perceived the barriers 'lack of time' to treat overweight and to give nutrition education. The most important barrier in 2007 was lack of patient motivation. CONCLUSIONS: The GPs perceived overweight and nutrition education as important and were still favourable towards prevention. However, their potential to give nutrition education or guide in treatment of overweight was not fully utilized because of decreased self-efficacy factors and perceived barriers.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease is a long-term chronic condition of the gastrointestinal tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous inflammation that occurs in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form fistulae. The cause is unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of medical treatments in adults to induce remission in Crohn's disease? What are the effects of lifestyle interventions in adults with Crohn's disease to maintain remission? What are the effects of surgical interventions in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease to induce remission? What are the effects of surgical interventions in adults with colonic Crohn's disease to induce remission? What are the effects of medical interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease; and to maintain remission following surgery? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to March 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 60 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aminosalicylates, antibiotics, azathioprine/mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, corticosteroids (oral), enteral nutrition, fish oil, infliximab, methotrexate, probiotics, resection, segmental colectomy, smoking cessation, and strictureplasty.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fecal lactoferrin (FLA) is a neutrophil-derived surrogate marker of intestinal inflammation that is elevated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. However, the correlation between FLA levels and serological markers of disease activity has not been previously reported, to our knowledge. In the present study we evaluated the ability of FLA levels to reflect disease activity in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We further assessed the relationship between FLA levels and customary laboratory and clinical measures of inflammation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fecal specimens were collected from 148 consecutive pediatric patients (79 with Crohn disease, 62 with ulcerative colitis, and 7 with irritable bowel syndrome) and 22 healthy control individuals. Lactoferrin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IBD-SCAN, TECHLAB, Inc). Disease activity was assessed at the time of sample provision by laboratory measures (including erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and albumin) and previously validated disease activity indices (Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index, Kozarek, Harvey Bradshaw Activity Index). RESULTS: Lactoferrin levels were significantly higher in patients with ulcerative colitis (1880 +/- 565 microg/mL) (mean +/- SE) or Crohn disease (1701 +/- 382 microg/mL) than in healthy control individuals under 21 years of age (1.17 +/- 0.47 microg/mL, P < 0.001). Lactoferrin levels correlated significantly with ESR, hematocrit, albumin, and platelet count (P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that FLA levels were comparable to ESR in detecting patients with clinically active disease (P < 0.001). Patients who experienced a clinical flare within 2 months of specimen collection displayed higher lactoferrin levels (845 +/- 452 microg/mL) than did those who remained in clinical remission (190 +/- 90 microg/mL, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Data presented here demonstrate that FLA is a sensitive and specific biochemical marker of inflammation for use in the diagnosis and interval assessment of pediatric patients with IBD, and its level correlates well with both clinical disease activity indices and ESR. Elevated levels of FLA may also identify patients at greater risk for the development of subsequent clinical flares.},

Infection of children with the conventional serotypes of Escherichia coli dramatically declined. During this period many new infective agents notably rota virus were recognised. By contrast, more children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease, have been diagnosed than ever before. Gastrointestinal allergy is increasingly recognised but the pattern of disease has changed. Technological advance in accurate diagnosis occurred with an emphasis upon tissue diagnosis. Introduction to clinical practice of ileocolonoscopy in the late 1970s immensely increased the ability to make the diagnosis of chronic IBD in children. Therapeutic advance has seen development of parenteral nutrition and enteral feeding as major therapies for children. In the UK there has been a rise and fall in university departments of paediatric gastroenterology.},

Data concerning the linear growth response are sparse and can only be accrued in children. METHODS: From September 2000 to February 2004, 32 children and adolescents (63% males; mean age 13.4 years, range 4.7-17.3) with chronically active CD despite immunomodulatory and prior corticosteroid therapy commenced infliximab therapy. Growth parameters standardized for age, gender, and pubertal development prior to and following infliximab therapy were compared. RESULTS: In all, 28 of 32 patients tolerated and responded to the induction regimen and 27 responders continued to receive infliximab via regularly scheduled infusions (n = 22) or episodically (n = 5) for a median of 26 months. Mean standard deviation score (SDS) for height at time of initiation of infliximab therapy was -1.15 +/- 1.2 and had declined despite the use of other therapies from -0.44 +/- 1.1 at initial diagnosis. Increases in height velocity and stature during infliximab therapy were limited by pubertal stage: Tanner I-III: DeltaSDS for height velocity +3.94, for height +0.50, P < 0.001; Tanner IV, V: DeltaSDS for height velocity +0.22, for height 0.02, P = NS. CONCLUSIONS: Height velocity improves and height centile increases during infliximab therapy provided patients are treated prior to or in early puberty. These data support the use of infliximab in young patients with otherwise refractory disease, and suggest that ultimate height in this subset of children with severe CD may be less compromised than with previous therapies.},

   abstract = {The carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin are believed to protect the human macula by absorbing blue light and quenching free radicals. Intestinal malabsorption syndromes such as celiac and Crohn's disease are known to cause deficiencies of lipid-soluble nutrients. We hypothesized that subjects with nutrient malabsorption syndromes will demonstrate lower carotenoid levels in the macula and blood, and that these lower levels may correlate with early-onset maculopathy. Resonance Raman spectrographic (RRS) measurements of macular carotenoid levels were collected from subjects with and without a history of malabsorption syndromes. Carotenoids were extracted from serum and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Subjects with malabsorption (n = 22) had 37% lower levels of macular carotenoids on average versus controls (n = 25, P < 0.001). Malabsorption was not associated with decreased serum carotenoid levels. Convincing signs of early maculopathy were not observed. We conclude that intestinal malabsorption results in lower macular carotenoid levels.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The aim of this prospective clinical evaluation was to investigate the influence of "Fast-track"-treatment in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal operations and its effect on morbidity, hospital stay and recovery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bowel cleaning under enteral hypercaloric nutrition (Biosorb Energie, Fa. Nutricia, Germany) was achieved with Fleet (Ferring Arzneimittel, Germany) one day prior to surgery. A peridural catheter was placed preoperatively. Intraoperative electrolyte substitution should not exceed 12 ml/kg KG/h. In case of decreasing intraoperative blood pressure hydroxyethylstarch 6% was substituted. The nasogastric tube was removed immediately after the operation, the urinary catheter was removed on the first postoperative day. The patients stayed on the intermediate care department for one night and started already there with oral feeding and mobilisation (for 2 h). The following days mobilisation increased to 4 h daily under normal enteral nutrition without infusions. RESULTS: Between June 2003 and January 2006, 147 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery were included in this study. Diverticulitis (n = 114), malignant tumors of the sigmoid colon (n = 6) or rectal cancer (n = 13), colonic adenomas (n = 5), stenotic Crohn's disease (n = 4) and small bowel carcinoid (n = 1), rectal prolaps (n = 1) and elongated colon sigmoideum (n = 4) were indications for surgical treatment. Laparoscopic sigmoid resection (n = 117), left hemicolectomy (n = 11), ileocecal resection (n = 8), anterior resection with total mesorectal excision (n = 9), abdomino-perineal exstirpation (n = 1) and anterior-segmental resection of the rectum (n = 1) were performed. Drainages were removed on the 2nd, peridural catheter on the 3rd postoperative day. Defecation occurred in all patients until the 2 (nd) postop. day. Early postoperative complication rate was 15% (22/147 patients) without mortality. 8 patients (5%) with anastomotic leakage were reoperated. The mean hospital stay was 6 days. The re-admission rate was 3% (4/147 patients) and included one patient with anastomotic leakage. CONCLUSION: "Fast-track"-treatment in combination with minimal-invasive surgery is a safe and comfortable perioperative treatment for patients with elective colorectal operations.},

   abstract = {AIM: There is limited information on the nutrition impact of antitumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment in adult Crohn's disease (CD). This study was performed to examine the effect of a 6-month course of infliximab on enterocyte function, nutrient status, metabolism, and body composition in these patients. METHODS: Seven CD patients were assessed for disease activity, enterocyte function, and body composition prior to, after 6 weeks, and after 6 months of infliximab treatment. Measurements included (1) disease activity: Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, Harvey Bradshaw Index, and C-reactive protein; (2) enterocyte function: folate, homocysteine, vitamin B(12), citrulline, vitamin D, beta-carotene, d-xylose absorption; (3) Prognostic Inflammatory and Nutritional Index (PINI); and (4) body composition and metabolism: body mass index (BMI), fat and lean body mass, resting energy expenditure (RRE), and respiratory quotient. RESULTS: Most patients had improvement in disease activity with infliximab. PINI decreased in all patients (-3.35, P = .04). Plasma folate concentration significantly increased. There was an increase in BMI, fat mass, and lean body mass. The respiratory quotient increased in most patients. Changes in citrulline level and REE were inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease patients have improvements in an index that measures both inflammation and nutrition (PINI) with infliximab therapy. Increases in plasma folate suggest improvement in enterocyte function and/or increased oral intake. The increase in respiratory quotient suggests decreased lipolysis and the lack of a starvation state. It was unclear whether weight gain was predominantly fat or lean muscle mass. These finding also support the use of PINI in Crohn's patients as an overall marker of inflammation and nutrition, and as a measure of response to infliximab therapy.},

The results of this study provide substantial evidence that bowel rest is not necessary to achieve remission in patients with active Crohn's disease receiving nutrition support. Before this study, great controversy existed about the use of nutrition support and bowel rest in the treatment of active Crohn's disease because of a limited number of conflicting studies providing evidence for and against its application. The results of the publication by Greenberg et al are fundamental because they helped to settle this important argument. Furthermore, this pivotal paper changed the clinical guidelines for the use of nutrition support in the management of active Crohn's disease. Since the publication of this pivotal article, many developments in the field of nutrition and in the treatment of Crohn's disease have helped validate and further its results. Subsequent studies and debate center on the use of enteral nutrition as primary treatment in patients with active Crohn's disease. Data regarding the efficacy, composition, and overall role of adult enteral nutrition in the management of Crohn's disease are presented. This article revisits the Greenberg paper and discusses some of these innovations in nutrition.},

Targeting TNF-alpha with monoclonal antibodies has changed the therapeutic landscape for tackling refractory and complicated CD. Intravenous use of infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF-alpha is, however, limited by the occurrence of adverse events, infusion reactions, infectious complications, aggravation of heart failure, the occurrence of neurological demyelinating conditions and induction of rare malignancies. The incremental development of next-generation TNF-alpha antibodies and binding proteins through antibody-engineering techniques has followed, with the aim of producing efficacious drugs that are less expensive to produce, have a convenient route of administration and have fewer side effects. Certolizumab pegol (CDP870, Cimzia) is an engineered humanized anti-TNF-alpha antibody Fab fragment that minimizes the protein component and is conjugated to polyethylene glycol. Clinical studies have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of moderate-to-severe active CD. Reported adverse events in the clinical trial program have been largely of mild-to-moderate severity, and occurred at similar frequencies in the active-treatment and placebo groups. Certolizumab pegol will be a useful addition to the armamentarium of biologic agents that can be used for the long-term treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {Twenty-five percent of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) diagnoses present in childhood, with Crohn's disease (CD) being the most common type. Many children have poor nutrition status at presentation of the disease, which may worsen during the clinical course, with a significant number of children having impaired linear growth. The cause of this poor nutrition status is complex, and contributing factors include inadequate intake, malabsorption, altered energy demands, and losses through stool, particularly in colitis. The principal aim of medical management is to induce disease remission, with minimal side effects, thereby enabling normal growth and development. This must include active consideration of the nutrition needs of such children and how they may be best met. However, our understanding of the manner in which the disease process affects the energy demands of children with CD or how poor nutrition, in turn, may affect the disease course is limited. This may constrain the efficacy and effectiveness of standard therapeutic approaches to care. This review explores the many factors of relevance in the delivery of nutrition support to children with inflammatory bowel disease, and explores the role of exclusive enteral nutrition as a corticosteroid-sparing strategy to induce remission in children with active Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recognizing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is straightforward when alarm symptoms are present, such as bloody diarrhea and weight loss. When the presentation is subtle or atypical, physicians must determine which patients warrant evaluation for IBD. Appropriate use of noninvasive tests can help identify which patients should undergo further investigation. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently IBD serologies lack high enough sensitivity and specificity to make them useful as a screening test for distinguishing IBD from other disorders, but they may have a role in classifying subtypes of IBD. Fecal markers seem promising for helping to differentiate IBD from irritable bowl syndrome and for monitoring disease activity. Pharmacogenetically guided dosing is recommended for safe use of thiopurines but ongoing routine laboratory monitoring remains important. Thiopurine metabolite measurement can be useful but may not be needed in all cases. SUMMARY: Primary care physicians should continue to rely on routine laboratory tests and clinical suspicion to decide which patients with abdominal pain to refer to a gastroenterologist. Serology panels are not useful for IBD screening as the results may lead to unnecessary procedures. Although fecal markers do show promise as a screening test for IBD, patient resistance to providing stool samples may limit its usefulness in disease monitoring. Thiopurine metabolite levels are best used in conjunction with clinical status and routine laboratory tests to monitor clinical response and adverse events.},

   abstract = {AIM: Infliximab (IFX) therapy is highly efficacious for the induction and maintenance of remission in pediatric Crohn disease (CD). However, to date it is unclear how long patients should be given IFX. Given the increasing safety concerns about the concomitant and prolonged use of IFX and azathioprine in CD, we wanted to address the clinical outcome in pediatric CD patients who responded to IFX medication, once IFX was stopped. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Upon induction therapy with 3 IFX infusions, 36 of 38 patients with CD were in clinical remission at 3 months. These 36 responders were separated into 2 groups: 16 patients received no further IFX infusions, whereas 20 patients received scheduled maintenance therapy with IFX for 12 months. RESULTS: Among the 16 patients who received no further IFX infusions, 12 experienced relapse during the 12-month follow-up interval after IFX was stopped. In the group receiving maintenance therapy, 11 of 20 patients remained in clinical remission at 12 months of therapy, whereas 8 patients required adjustment of IFX doses or intervals. Among the 11 children who were in clinical remission and receiving maintenance therapy without dose adjustment, 8 experienced relapse within 12 months after IFX maintenance therapy was stopped. Overall, the relapse rates after IFX induction or maintenance therapy was stopped were 75% and 72%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that IFX is efficacious in controlling severe pediatric CD; however, to induce and maintain clinical remission, repeated IFX infusions are required, with a need for dose adjustment in a substantial number of patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Adalimumab has recently become available for adult patients with Crohn disease (CD) as a viable alternative tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor to infliximab. To our knowledge, there have been no studies reviewing the use of adalimumab in pediatric patients with CD. Our aim was to examine the safety and efficacy of adalimumab therapy in pediatric patients with CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 15 pediatric patients with CD who received adalimumab at a single institution between January 2003 and March 2007. All of the patients had a history of an attenuated response or anaphylaxis to infliximab. Each patient's chart was reviewed for age at diagnosis, sex, extent of disease, age at start of adalimumab therapy, course of therapy, side effects noted during therapy, concurrent medications, and response to adalimumab. Clinical response to adalimumab was classified as complete, partial, or no response based on the patients' ability to be weaned from steroids, increased or decreased need for steroids, or need for surgery during the course of treatment. This study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board. RESULTS: Fifteen pediatric patients with CD received adalimumab for a 33-month period. Of those, 14 patients had adequate follow-up, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. The mean age at initiation of therapy was 16.6 years (median 17.9 years, range 10.3-21.8 years, SD 3.1 years). The majority of patients received an 80-mg loading dose administered subcutaneously and 40-mg doses subsequently every 2 weeks. The median duration of therapy was 6.5 months (range 1-31 months). A total of 272 injections were given. Of the 14 patients with sufficient data for follow-up, 7 (50%) had a complete response, 2 (14%) had a partial response, and 5 (36%) had no response to adalimumab. Complete response was achieved after a median of 5 injections (range 3-11). Of the 14 patients with adequate follow-up, 5 had fistulizing disease; 3 of these maintained fistula closure, 1 had temporary closure, and 1 required surgery to assist with closure. Twenty-six adverse events occurred during therapy. Eight (57%) patients had at least 1 adverse effect. The most common events were abdominal pain and nausea. No serious adverse events were reported, no serious infections occurred, and no adverse events required discontinuation of adalimumab. CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab was well tolerated in pediatric patients with CD. Complete or partial response was observed in 64% of patients. No serious adverse events occurred during therapy. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and to determine optimal dosing of adalimumab in the pediatric population with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-term enteral nutrition may maintain clinical and endoscopic remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the impacts of long-term enteral nutrition on clinical and endoscopic disease activities and mucosal tissue cytokines in patients with quiescent CD. METHODS: Forty patients with CD who achieved clinical remission were included. Of these, 20 received continuous elemental diet (Elental) infusion during the nighttime and a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group) and 20 received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). With these regimens, all 40 patients were monitored for 1 year. Further, ileocolonoscopy was performed at entry, at 6 and 12 months, and mucosal biopsies were taken for cytokine assays. RESULTS: On an intention-to-treat basis, 5 patients (25%) in the EN group and 13 (65%) in the non-EN group had a clinical relapse during the 1-year observation (P = 0.03). The mean endoscopic inflammation (EI) scores were not significantly different between the groups at both entry and 6 months, but at 12 months EI scores were significantly higher in the non-EN group than in the EN group (P = 0.04). Additionally, the mucosal tissue interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels significantly increased with time in the non-EN group (entry versus 12 months, IL-1beta, P = 0.02; IL-6, P = 0.002; TNF-alpha, P = 0.001). In the EN group these cytokines did not show a significant increase. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term enteral nutrition in patients with quiescent CD has a clear suppressive effect on clinical and endoscopic disease activities and the mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of enteral nutrition on post-operative recurrence has not been properly examined. AIM: To investigate the impact of enteral nutrition using an elemental diet on clinical and endoscopic recurrence after resection for Crohn's disease. METHODS: Forty consecutive patients who underwent resection for ileal or ileocolonic Crohn's disease were studied. After operation, 20 patients continuously received enteral nutritional therapy (EN group), and 20 had neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). In the EN group, enteral formula (Elental) was infused through a nasogastric tube in the night-time, and low fat foods were taken in the daytime. All patients were followed up regularly for 1 year after operation. Ileocolonoscopy was performed at 6 and 12 months after operation. RESULTS: One patient (5%) in the EN group and seven (35%) in the non-EN group developed clinical recurrence during 1-year follow-up (P = 0.048). Six months after operation, five patients (25%) in the EN group and eight (40%) in the non-EN group developed endoscopic recurrence (P = 0.50). Twelve months after operation, endoscopic recurrence was observed in six patients (30%) in the EN group and 14 (70%) in the non-EN group (P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term enteral nutritional therapy significantly reduced clinical and endoscopic recurrence after resection for Crohn's disease.},

Recent advances in research on genetic susceptibility have allowed the identification of diverse genes at different levels: (1) Innate immunity; (2) Antigen presentation molecules; (3) Epithelial integrity; (4) Drug transporter; (5) Cell adhesion. The application of genetic testing into clinical practice is close and all genetic markers may have several clinical implications: prediction of disease phenotype, molecular classification, prevention of complications, and prognosis.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, which clinically present as one of two disorders, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Mainstays of drug treatments for IBD include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, methotrexate and cyclosporin. Advances in basic research of the pathophysiological process in IBD have been applied to generate a variety of new therapeutics targeting at different levels of the inflammatory processes. New therapies are classified as: (1) Anti-TNFalpha antibodies; (2) Recombinant cytokines; (3) Selective adhesion blockade; (4) Growth factors; (5) Innate immunostimulation; (6) Nucleic acid based therapies; (7) Gene therapy; (8) Autologous bone-marrow transplantation; (9) Helminths and (10) Extracorporeal immunomodulation. All treatments have the potential to provide more effective and safe treatment for IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease is controversial. Increasing research on the mechanisms by which nutritional therapy improves the clinical well being of patients with Crohn's disease has led to novel formula design and trials comparing two different forms of enteral nutrition. This meta-analysis aims to provide an update on the existing effectiveness data for both corticosteroids versus enteral nutrition and for one form of enteral nutrition versus another for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) as primary therapy to induce remission in Crohn's disease and to examine the importance of formula composition on effectiveness. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were selected using a computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic databases MEDLINE (1966-2006) and EMBASE (1984-2006), as well as the Science Citation Index on Web of Science. Additional citations were sought by manual search of references of articles retrieved from the computerized search, abstracts submitted to major gastroenterologic meetings and published in the journals: American Journal of Gastroenterology, Gut, Gastroenterology, Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, and Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, and from the reviewers' personal files or contact with leaders in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials involving patients with active Crohn's disease defined by a clinical disease activity index were considered for review. Studies evaluating the administration of one type of enteral nutrition to one group of patients and another type of enteral nutrition or conventional corticosteroids to the other group were selected for review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted independently by two authors and any discrepancies were resolved by rereading and discussion. For the dichotomous variable, achievement of remission, individual and pooled trial statistics were calculated as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); both fixed and random effect models were used. The results for each analysis were tested for heterogeneity using the chi square statistic. The studies were separated into two groups: A. one form of enteral nutrition compared with another form of enteral nutrition and B. one form of enteral nutrition compared with corticosteroids. Subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of clinical or disease criteria and formula composition. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the basis of the inclusion of abstract publications, methodologic quality and by random or fixed effects models. MAIN RESULTS: In part A, of the 15 included eligible trials (one abstract) comparing different formulations of EN for the treatment of active CD, 11 compared one (or more) elemental formula to a non-elemental one, three compared enteral diets of similar protein composition but different fat composition, and one compared non-elemental diets differing only in glutamine enrichment. Meta-analysis of ten trials comprising 334 patients demonstrated no difference in the efficacy of elemental versus non-elemental formulas (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.75). Subgroup analyses performed to evaluate the different types of elemental and non-elemental diets (elemental, semi-elemental and polymeric) showed no statistically significant differences. Further analysis of seven trials including 209 patients treated with EN formulas of differing fat content (low fat: < 20 g/1000 kCal versus high fat: > 20 g/1000 kCal) demonstrated no statistically significant difference in efficacy (OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.63 to 2.01). Similarly, the effect of very low fat content (< 3 g/1000 kCal) or type of fat (long chain triglycerides) were investigated, but did not demonstrate a difference in efficacy in the treatment of active CD, although a non significant trend was demonstrated favoring very low fat and very low long chain triglyceride content. This result should be interpreted with caution due to statistically significant heterogeneity and small sample size. Sensitivity analyses had no significant effects on the results. The role of specific fatty acids or disease characteristics on response to therapy could not be evaluated. In part B, eight trials (including two abstracts) comparing enteral nutrition to steroid therapy met the inclusion criteria for review. Meta-analysis of six trials that included 192 patients treated with enteral nutrition and 160 treated with steroids yielded a pooled OR of 0.33 favouring steroid therapy (95% CI 0.21 to 0.53). A sensitivity analysis including the abstracts resulted in an increase in the number of participants to 212 in the enteral nutrition group and 179 in the steroid group but the meta-analysis yielded a similar result (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.56). There were inadequate data from full publications to perform further subgroup analyses by age, disease duration and disease location. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid therapy is more effective than enteral nutrition for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease as was found in previous systematic reviews. Protein composition does not influence the effectiveness of EN in the treatment of active CD. A non significant trend favouring very low fat and/or very low long chain triglyceride content exists but larger trials are required to explore the significance of this finding.},

   abstract = {T-cell mediated acute inflammation of the ileum may occur during Crohn's disease exacerbations. During ileal inflammation, absorption of nutrients and electrolytes by villus cells is decreased with a concomitant increase in crypt and/or villus fluid secretion. These alterations lead to fluid accumulation and the subsequent diarrhoea. Net intestinal fluid secretion consists of HCO3--rich plasma-like fluid. However, the regulation and mechanisms of HCO3- secretion in normal and acutely inflamed ileum are not clearly understood. To study this phenomenon, anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb)- induced in vivo ileal inflammatory mouse models was used for in vitro functional studies with Ussing chamber and pH stat techniques. Three hours after anti-CD3 mAb injection, ileal mucosa stripped of muscular and serosal layers showed a significant increase in short circuit current (Isc) (0.58+/-0.07 microEq h(-1) cm2 versus 1.63+/-0.14 microEq h(-1) cm2). The cAMP-stimulated Isc component was sensitive to glibenclamide but not to DIDS, suggesting that a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Cftr)-mediated anion conductance was responsible. Basal Cl--dependent HCO3- secretion, measured using a pH stat technique, was decreased significantly in anti-CD3-injected mice, with a simultaneous increase in Cl--independent HCO3- secretion that was also inhibited by glibenclamide. Experiments using Cftr-/- mice showed neither an increase in Isc nor an increase in HCO3- secretion, confirming the role for Cftr protein in stimulating anion secretion following anti-CD3 treatment. Western blot analysis indicated that Cftr protein levels were unaltered by anti-CD3 treatment, at least acutely. Finally, an immunoassay for cAMP showed significant increases in intracellular cAMP in villus cells, but not in crypt cells. These studies therefore suggest a shift from a predominantly electroneutral Cl-HCO3- exchange in normal mice, to a predominantly electrogenic anion secretion including HCO3- that occurs via functional Cftr during anti-CD3-mediated acute inflammation.},
