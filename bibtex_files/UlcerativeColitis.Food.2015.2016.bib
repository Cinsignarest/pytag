   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypokalemic pareses are caused by low extracellular potassium levels which reduce the resting membrane potential of muscle cells and make them less excitable. It may be caused by an intracellular shift of potassium, renal potassium loss, reduced potassium intake or increased gastrointestinal loss. CASE PRESENTATION: A woman in her 60s presented with rapid-onset tetraparesis and hyporeflexia starting the day before admission. The patient history revealed several months of low food intake, increased alcohol consumption and diarrhoea. Laboratory tests showed severe hypokalemia (1.5 mmol/l) and hypomagnesemia (0.38 mmol/l), and ECG showed atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit and treated with intravenous normal saline with added potassium and magnesium, with good effect on her symptoms. Urine tests showed high potassium-creatinine ratio (4.22 mmol/mmol creatinine) and increased fractional excretion of magnesium (18.6%). Abdominal CT scan revealed colonic wall thickening, and colonic biopsies showed mild inflammation. Faecal calprotectin was moderately elevated (294 mg/kg). INTERPRETATION: The patient had hypokalemic pareses for which there were several contributing factors. The renal causes were augmented excretion of magnesium and potassium, probably due to increased alcohol consumption. The extrarenal causes were increased gastrointestinal loss, with ulcerative colitis being the presumed explanation, and reduced food intake.},

   abstract = {We aim to review the literature and provide guidance on preventive health measures in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Structured searches were performed in PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from January 1976 to June 2016 using the following keywords: (inflammatory bowel disease OR Crohn's disease OR ulcerative colitis) AND (health maintenance OR preventive health OR health promotion). Abstracts of the articles selected from each of these multiple searches were reviewed, and those meeting the inclusion criteria (that is, providing data regarding preventive health or health maintenance in IBD patients) were recorded. Reference lists from the selected articles were manually reviewed to identify further relevant studies. Patients with IBD are at increased risk of developing adverse events related to the disease course, therapeutic interventions, or non-adherence to medication. Recent studies have suggested that IBD patients do not receive preventive services with the same thoroughness as patients with other chronic diseases. Preventive health measures can avert morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients with IBD. Gastroenterologists and primary care physicians (PCPs) should have an up to date working knowledge of preventive health measures for IBD patients. A holistic approach and better communication between gastroenterologists and PCPs with explicit clarification of roles will prevent duplication of services and streamline care.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic lifelong condition characterized by alternating flare-ups and remission. There is no single known unifying cause, and the pathogenesis is multifactorial, with genetics, environmental factors, microbiota, and the immune system all playing roles. Current treatment modalities for UC include 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants (including purine antimetabolites, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus), and surgery. Therapeutic goals for UC are evolving. Medical treatment aims to induce remission and prevent relapse of disease activity. Infliximab, an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha monoclonal antibody, is the first biological agent for the treatment of UC. Over the last decade, infliximab and adalimumab (anti-TNF-alpha agents) have been used for moderate to severe UC, and have been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission. Recent studies have indicated that golimumab (another anti-TNF-alpha agent), tofacitinib (a Janus kinase inhibitor), and vedolizumab and etrolizumab (integrin antagonists), achieved good clinical remission and response rates in UC. Recently, golimumab and vedolizumab have been approved for UC by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Vedolizumab may be used as a first-line alternative to anti-TNF-alpha therapy in patients with an inadequate response to corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants. Here, we provide updated information on various biological agents in the treatment of UC.},

   abstract = {Dendritic cells present in the digestive tract are constantly exposed to environmental antigens, commensal flora, and invading pathogens. Under steady-state conditions, these cells have high tolerogenic potential, triggering differentiation of regulatory T cells to protect the host from unwanted proinflammatory immune responses to innocuous antigens or commensals. On the other hand, these cells must discriminate between commensal flora and invading pathogens and mount powerful immune response against pathogens. A potential result of unbalanced tolerogenic versus proinflammatory responses mediated by dendritic cells is associated with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, food allergies, and celiac disease. Herein, we review the dendritic cell population involved in mediating tolerance and immunity in mucosal surfaces, the progress in unveiling their development in vivo, and factors that can influence their functions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis [UC] is associated with colonic mucosa barrier defects and bacterial dysbiosis, but these features may simply be the result of inflammation. Therefore, we sought to assess whether these features are inherently abrogated in the terminal ileum [TI] of UC patients, where inflammation is absent. METHODS: TI biopsies from paediatric inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] subsets [Crohn's disease [CD; n = 13] and UC [n = 10]], and non-IBD disease controls [n = 12] were histologically graded, and alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff stained biopsies were quantified. The mucosal barrier was assessed for mucin [MUC2], immunoglobulin [Ig]A, IgG, and total bacteria (fluorescence in-situ hybridisation [FISH probe EUB338]) by immunofluorescence. The regulation of mucin secretion was investigated by NLRP6 gene expression and immunofluorescence. The composition of the active mucosa-associated microbiota was explored by sequencing the 16S rRNA amplicon generated from total RNA. RESULTS: Despite the absence of ileitis, UC patients displayed ileal barrier depletion illustrated by reductions in mucin-containing goblet cells and mucin production and altered epithelial NLRP6 expression. In both CD patients with ileitis and UC patients with normal histology, bacteria coated with IgA and IgG penetrated the TI mucin layer. Biopsy 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a reduction in alpha-diversity by three methods [Shannon, Simpson, and Equitability indices] between UC and non-IBD paediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an underlying defect in the UC-afflicted intestinal tract even in the absence of inflammation, implicating barrier and microbial changes as primary abnormalities in UC that may play a causative role in disease development.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Discuss issues regarding clinical trial design for the development of biosimilars in the European Union and the United States, with special focus on monoclonal antibodies used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. METHODS: A search of the Internet as well as PubMed was conducted through June 2014 for information related to the clinical development of biosimilars using the keywords biosimilar, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) websites were searched for biosimilar guidelines. RESULTS: The EMA began issuing draft guidelines for the development of biosimilars almost a decade ago and has approved numerous biosimilars. The US FDA has issued draft guidances providing stepwise considerations for the nonclinical and clinical development of biosimilars but has yet to approve a biosimilar under this pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical trials aim to resolve uncertainties that may remain following nonclinical development regarding the similarity of the proposed biosimilar with the reference product. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies form the backbone of early clinical development and serve to inform phase 3 clinical development. Factors to be considered in clinical development include study population, design, end points, sample size, duration, and analytical methods.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet plays a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Dietary zinc may influence risk of disease through effects on autophagy, innate and adaptive immune response and maintenance of the intestinal barrier. METHODS: We analysed data from 170 776 women from the Nurses Health Study I and Nurses Health Study II, who were followed for 26 years. Zinc intake was assessed using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires administered every 4 years. Incident CD and UC were ascertained by medical record review. Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders determined the independent association between zinc intake and incident disease. RESULTS: Over 3 317 550 person-years (p-y) of follow-up, we identified 269 incident cases of CD and 338 incident cases of UC. Zinc intake ranged from 9 mg/day in the lowest quintile to 27 mg/day in the highest quintile. Compared with women with the lowest quintile of intake, the multivariate hazard ratios (HR) for CD were 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65 - 1.29) for women in the second quintile of intake, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.40 - 0.89) for the third quintile, 0.57 (95% CI, 0.38 - 0.86) for fourth quintile and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.50 - 1.10) for the highest quintile (Ptrend = 0.003). The association was stronger for dietary zinc (HR 0.63, 95% CI, 0.43 - 0.93, comparing extreme quintiles) than for zinc intake from supplements. Neither dietary nor supplemental zinc modified risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: In two large prospective cohorts of women, intake of zinc was inversely associated with risk of CD but not UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC); yet, there are few prospective studies of dietary factors. None have examined the association between adolescent diet and risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (CD and UC). METHODS: This study included women enrolled in Nurses' Health Study II who completed a validated high school dietary questionnaire in 1998. We examined the effect of dietary patterns (prudent or Western diet) and individual components of each patterns. We documented incident cases of CD and UC through 2011 based on physician review of medical records and used Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for confounders to estimate hazard ratios and confidence intervals for CD and UC. RESULTS: Over 763,229 person-years of follow-up, we identified 70 incident cases of CD and 103 cases of UC. Compared with women in the lowest quartile of a prudent diet score (characterized by greater intake of fruits, vegetables, and fish), women in the highest quartile had a 53% lower risk of CD (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.98; P trend = 0.04). Specifically, greater intake of fish (P trend = 0.01) and fiber (P trend = 0.06) were associated with lower risk of CD. In contrast, Western diet score was not associated with risk of CD. Neither dietary patterns nor individual food or nutrient groups was associated with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent diet is associated with risk of CD, but not UC, offering insights into disease pathogenesis.},

The Food and Drug Administration has classified these factors in category B, which means that they do not demonstrate a fetal risk. However, during pregnancy fetuses are exposed to high anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels that are measurable in their plasma after birth. Since antibodies can transfer through the placenta at the end of the second and during the third trimesters, it is important to know the safety profile of these drugs, particularly for the fetus, and whether maintaining relapse of the disease compensates for the potential risks of fetal exposure. The limited data available for the anti-TNF drugs to date have not demonstrated any significant adverse outcomes in the pregnant women who continued their therapy from conception to the first trimester of gestation. However, data suggest that anti-TNFs should be discontinued during the third trimester, as they may affect the immunological system of the newborn baby. Each decision should be individualized, based on the distinct characteristics of the patient and her disease. Considering all the above, there is a need for more clinical studies regarding the effect of anti-TNF therapeutic agents on pregnancy outcomes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is the most common form of inflammatory bowel disease in the UK. UC can have a considerable impact on patients' quality of life. The burden for the NHS is substantial. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of interventions, to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of all interventions and comparators (including medical and surgical options), to estimate the expected net budget impact of each intervention, and to identify key research priorities. DATA SOURCES: Peer-reviewed publications, European Public Assessment Reports and manufacturers' submissions. The following databases were searched from inception to December 2013 for clinical effectiveness searches and from inception to January 2014 for cost-effectiveness searches for published and unpublished research evidence: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, The Cochrane Library including the Cochrane Systematic Reviews Database, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Health Technology Assessment database and NHS Economic Evaluation Database; ISI Web of Science, including Science Citation Index, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science and Bioscience Information Service Previews. The US Food and Drug Administration website and the European Medicines Agency website were also searched, as were research registers, conference proceedings and key journals. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review [including network meta-analysis (NMA)] was conducted to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of named interventions. The health economic analysis included a review of published economic evaluations and the development of a de novo model. RESULTS: Ten randomised controlled trials were included in the systematic review. The trials suggest that adult patients receiving infliximab (IFX) [Remicade((R)), Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd (MSD)], adalimumab (ADA) (Humira((R)), AbbVie) or golimumab (GOL) (Simponi((R)), MSD) were more likely to achieve clinical response and remission than those receiving placebo (PBO). Hospitalisation data were limited, but suggested more favourable outcomes for ADA- and IFX-treated patients. Data on the use of surgical intervention were sparse, with a potential benefit for intervention-treated patients. Data were available from one trial to support the use of IFX in paediatric patients. Safety issues identified included serious infections, malignancies and administration site reactions. Based on the NMA, in the induction phase, all biological treatments were associated with statistically significant beneficial effects relative to PBO, with the greatest effect associated with IFX. For patients in response following induction, all treatments except ADA and GOL 100 mg at 32-52 weeks were associated with beneficial effects when compared with PBO, although these were not significant. The greatest effects at 8-32 and 32-52 weeks were associated with 100 mg of GOL and 5 mg/kg of IFX, respectively. For patients in remission following induction, all treatments except ADA at 8-32 weeks and GOL 50 mg at 32-52 weeks were associated with beneficial effects when compared with PBO, although only the effect of ADA at 32-52 weeks was significant. The greatest effects were associated with GOL (at 8-32 weeks) and ADA (at 32-52 weeks). The economic analysis suggests that colectomy is expected to dominate drug therapies, but for some patients, colectomy may not be considered acceptable. In circumstances in which only drug options are considered, IFX and GOL are expected to be ruled out because of dominance, while the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ADA versus conventional treatment is approximately pound50,300 per QALY gained. LIMITATIONS: The health economic model is subject to several limitations: uncertainty associated with extrapolating trial data over a lifetime horizon, the model does not consider explicit sequential pathways of non-biological treatments, and evidence relating to complications of colectomy was identified through consideration of approaches used within previous models rather than a full systematic review. CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients receiving IFX, ADA or GOL were more likely to achieve clinical response and remission than those receiving PBO. Further data are required to conclusively demonstrate the effect of interventions on hospitalisation and surgical outcomes. The economic analysis indicates that colectomy is expected to dominate medical treatments for moderate to severe UC. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42013006883.

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a major form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) worldwide. Better understanding of the pathogenesis of UC has led to the development of novel therapeutic agents that target specific mediators of the inflammatory cascade. A number of biological agents have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of UC and several more are currently in various phases of drug development. The commonly used agents include TNFalpha antagonists (e.g. infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab) and anti-integrin agents (vedolizumab). These biological agents have profoundly influenced the management of UC patients, especially those with refractory disease. This paper reviews the currently available knowledge and evidence for the use of various biological agents in the treatment of UC.},

   abstract = {Diet and nutritional factors have emerged as possible interventions for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which are characterised by chronic uncontrolled inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Microalgal species are a promising source of n-3 PUFA and derived oxylipins, which are lipid mediators with a key role in the resolution of inflammation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of an oxylipin-containing lyophilised biomass from Chlamydomonas debaryana on a recurrent 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis mice model. Moderate chronic inflammation of the colon was induced in BALB/c mice by weekly intracolonic instillations of low dose of TNBS. Administration of the lyophilised microalgal biomass started 2 weeks before colitis induction and was continued throughout colitis development. Mice were killed 48 h after the last TNBS challenge. Oral administration of the microalgal biomass reduced TNBS-induced intestinal inflammation, evidenced by an inhibition of body weight loss, an improvement in colon morphology and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-17. This product also down-regulated colonic expressions of inducible nitric oxide, cyclo-oxygenase 2 and NF-kappaB, as well as increased PPAR-gamma. In addition, lyophilised microalgal biomass up-regulated the expressions of the antioxidant transcription factor nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 and the target gene heme oxygenase 1. This study describes for the first time the prophylactic effects of an oxylipin-containing lyophilised microalgae biomass from C. debaryana in the acute phase of a recurrent TNBS-induced colitis model in mice. These findings suggest the potential use of this microalga, or derived oxylipins, as a nutraceutical in the treatment of IBD.},

   abstract = {Aim of the present study is to develop embelin lipid nanospheres (LNE) for better treatment of ulcerative colitis. Embelin LNs were developed using soya bean oil/virgin coconut oil as liquid lipid carrier and soya/egg lecithin as stabilizer by hot homogenization followed by ultrasonication technique. The particle size of LNEs ranged from 196.1+/-3.57 to 269.2+/-1.05nm with narrow polydispersity index values whereas zeta potential was from -36.6 to -62.0mV. Embelin was successfully incorporated into lipid nanospheres with entrapment efficiency about 99%. There was no interaction between embelin and selected liquid lipids which was confirmed by FTIR studies. In vitro drug release studies performed using Franz diffusion cell and results showed sustained release of embelin. Embelin LNs were stabilized with egg and soya lecithin, embelin release from these LNs followed Higuchi model and first order model, respectively, however mechanism of drug release in both LNs was non-Fickian. In vivo studies were carried out using acetic acid induced ulcerative colitis rat model and results revealed that treatment with embelin LNs significantly reduced clinical activity and macroscopic scores compared to embelin conventional suspension. Treatment with embelin LNs decreased MPO, LDH and LPO levels, increased reduced GSH levels which indicated better treatment of ulcerative colitis was achieved. This was also confirmed by improved histopathological conditions. Thus embelin LNs could be favourably used for treatment of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two major forms of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Vitamin A (VA) and vitamin D (VD) may be associated with reduction in inflammation in these disorders. The aim of this review was to show the current evidence that may associate VA and VD with IBDs. Data linking VA, VD, and IBDs were studied. Both VA and VD may be related to the immune system in different manners. The active form of VA, retinoic acid, may be related to the growth factor-beta and release of interleukin-10 (IL-10), thus involved with the resolution of the inflammation. Its deficiency is associated with the increase of disease activity. The active form of VD is 1,25(OH)2D3 that produces biological effects via the nuclear hormone receptor named VD receptor (VDR), which may interfere with the immune cells and macrophages leading to the suppression of the inflammatory process by decreasing the release of TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8, IL-12, and IL-23. VDR may also activate nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 expression and stimulate the production of the defensin and cathelicidin that are important to the homeostasis of the mucosal immune barrier. The use of VA and VD could be helpful in the treatment and prevention of IBDs but more studies are necessary to establish the precise role of these compounds in the prevention or remission of these inflammatory processes.},

   abstract = {Adjuvants to the traditional therapy of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been studied to enhance the efficacy of the treatment and improve patients' quality of life. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega3FA) have been associated with attenuation of the inflammatory responses in IBD, possibly acting as substrates for anti-inflammatory eicosanoid production, similar to prostaglandins and leukotrienes. omega3FA also act as substrates for the synthesis of resolvins, maresins and protectins, indispensable in resolving inflammation processes. These acids may influence the development or course of IBD by: reducing oxidative stress, production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and proinflammatory cytokines; working as chemopreventive agents; and decreasing the expression of adhesion molecules. There are numerous controversies in the literature on the effects of omega3FA in the prevention or treatment of IBD, but their effects in reducing inflammation is incontestable. Therefore, more studies are warranted to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms and establish the recommended daily intake to prevent or induce remission in IBD patients.},

Meta-analysis of several randomized controlled trials have confirmed benefit for the administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea and to treat acute infectious diarrhea. Individual studies have also suggested benefit of probiotics to prevent acute gastroenteritis and serve as an adjunct in ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, CDI, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic in breastfed babies. Although promising, larger well-designed studies need to confirm these findings.

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic, relapsing and remitting set of conditions characterized by an excessive inflammatory response leading to the destruction of the gastrointestinal tract. While the exact etiology of inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests that the human gastrointestinal microbiome plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Manipulation of the gut microbiome has therefore emerged as an attractive alternative for both prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against inflammation. Despite its growing popularity among patients, review of the current literature suggests that the adult microbiome is a highly stable structure resilient to short-term interventions. In fact, most evidence to date demonstrates that therapeutic agents targeting the microflora trigger rapid changes in the microbiome, which then reverts to its pre-treatment state once the therapy is completed. Based on these findings, our ability to treat inflammatory bowel disease through short-term manipulations of the human microbiome may only have a transient effect. Thus, this review is intended to highlight the use of various therapeutic options, including diet, pre- and probiotics, antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplant, to manipulate the microbiome, with specific attention to the alterations made to the microflora along with the duration of impact.},

C. butyricum (Cb) is a probiotic and has been employed in the treatment of immune diseases. This study tests a hypothesis that specific immunotherapy (SIT) plus oral Cb (an over-the-counter probiotic) alleviates the UC symptoms. In this study, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, clinical study at our hospital. A total of 80 patients with relapsing-remitting ulcerative colitis and high levels of specific IgE antibody was randomly divided into 4 groups, and were treated with SIT or/and Cb, or placebo, respectively for 1 year. The results showed that a food antigen-specific Th2 polarization immune response was observed in UC patients with food allergy (FA). The frequency of regulatory B cells was significantly less in UC patients with FA as compared with healthy subjects. The UC patients with FA were treated with SIT and Cb showed significant amelioration of UC clinical symptoms, reduction of using UC-control medicines, and suppression of the skewed Th2 polarization, which did not occur in those treated with either SIT alone, or Cb alone, or placebo. In conclusion, combination of SIT and Cb efficiently alleviates a fraction of UC patients.},

   abstract = {Mast cells are constitutively found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The three major physiological functions of GI mast cells comprise of - as far as we know - regulation of GI functions, namely epithelial and endothelial functions, crosstalk with the enteric nervous system, and contribution to the host defense against bacterial, viral and parasitic agents. A number of chronic GI diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and food allergies, are thought to be associated with mast cell hyperplasia and humoral activity. Clinical conditions characterized by a decrease in mast cell functionality are not known so far. In the present review, we summarize current evidence which show that human mast cells play a central role at the GI barrier, both in health and disease.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been reported to have putative health effects including the prevention of inflammation and obesity. Historically, polyphenols have been regarded as antinutritionals and while such effects may be beneficial in obese subjects, they may be deleterious in nutritionally compromised individuals. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the effect of EGCG in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated mouse model of ulcerative colitis. Following induction of colitis, mice were treated with EGCG (3.2 mg/g) as the sole source of drinking fluid for 3 days. EGCG treatment mitigated DSS-induced colon shortening and spleen enlargement. EGCG also decreased colonic protein levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, as well as colonic lipid peroxides compared to DSS-treated controls. We observed that EGCG reduced DSS-induced gastrointestinal permeability. These beneficial effects were offset by enhanced body weight loss in EGCG-treated mice compared to DSS-treated controls. These effects were related to decreased protein and lipid digestion in EGCG-treated mice compared to DSS-treated controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that although EGCG may exert anti-inflammatory effects, its ability to modulate macronutrient digestion may represent a dose-limiting adverse effect that must be considered in the context of its use for treating inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {The association of carboxymethyl starch (CMS) and alginate is proposed as a novel matrix for the entrapment of bioactive agents in microspheres affording their protection against gastrointestinal degradation. In this study, the enzyme diamine oxidase (DAO) from white pea (Lathyrus sativus) was immobilized by inclusion in microspheres formed by ionotropic gelation of CMS/alginate by complexation with Ca(2+) . The association of CMS to alginate generated a more compact structure presenting a lesser porosity, thus decreasing the access of gastric fluid inside the microspheres and preventing the loss of entrapped enzyme. Moreover, the immobilized enzyme remained active and was able to oxidize the polyamine substrates even in the presence of degrading proteases of pancreatin. The inclusion yield in terms of entrapped protein was of about 82%-95%. The DAO entrapped in calcium CMS/alginate beads retained up to 70% of its initial activity in simulated gastric fluid (pH 2.0). In simulated intestinal fluid (pH 7.2) with pancreatin, an overall retention of 65% of activity for the immobilized DAO was observed over 24 H, whereas in similar conditions the free enzyme was totally inactivated. Our project proposes the vegetal DAO as an antihistaminic agent orally administered to treat food histaminosis and colon inflammation.},

   abstract = {In ulcerative colitis (UC) the butyrate metabolism is impaired, leading to energy-deficiency in the colonic cells. The effect of inflammation on the butyrate metabolism was investigated. HT-29 cells were incubated with pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and/or IFN-gamma) for 1 and 24 h. Cells were additionally stimulated with butyrate to investigate its anti-inflammatory potential. Butyrate uptake and oxidation were measured using (14)C-labeled butyrate. Gene expression of the butyrate metabolism enzymes, interleukin 8 (IL-8; inflammatory marker) and villin-1 (VIL-1; epithelial cell damage marker) was measured via quantitative RT-PCR. Significantly increased IL-8 expression and decreased VIL-1 expression after 24 h incubation with TNF-alpha and/or IFN-gamma confirmed the presence of inflammation. These conditions induced a decrease of both butyrate uptake and oxidation, whereas the gene expression was not reduced. Simultaneous incubation with butyrate counteracted the reduced butyrate oxidation. In contrast, 1 h incubation with TNF-alpha induced a significant increased IL-8 expression and decreased butyrate uptake. Incubation with TNF-alpha and/or IFN-gamma for 1 h did not induce cell damage nor influence butyrate oxidation. The inflammation-induced downregulation of the butyrate metabolism was not caused by a reduced gene expression, but appeared consequential to a decreased butyrate uptake. Increasing the luminal butyrate levels might have therapeutic potential in UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) have been associated with an abnormal mucosal response to the gastrointestinal microbiota. Although dietary fiber affects the gastrointestinal microbiota, there is limited information on the role of fiber on IBD activity. We investigated factors associated with fiber consumption and whether it was associated with flares in patients with IBD. METHODS: We collected a completed 26-item dietary survey from 1619 participants in the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Partners Internet cohort (Crohn's disease, 1130; ulcerative colitis/indeterminate colitis, 489). Eligible individuals were in remission based on disease activity index at baseline and completed a follow-up survey 6 months later. Fiber and whole grain consumption were categorized into quartiles and deciles. Disease flare at 6 months was defined as a disease activity index score exceeding remission cutoff values, and/or an IBD-related surgical procedure or hospitalization since baseline. RESULTS: Participants with longer duration of disease, past history of surgery, and past IBD hospitalization ate less fiber. The risks for disease flare differed by disease type. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of fiber consumption, participants with Crohn's disease in the highest quartile were less likely to have a flare (adjusted odds ratios [OR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.90). Participants with Crohn's disease who reported that they did not avoid high-fiber foods were approximately 40% less likely to have a disease flare than those who avoided high-fiber foods (adjusted OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.43-0.81). There was no association between fiber intake and flares in patients with ulcerative colitis (adjusted OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 0.92-3.60). CONCLUSIONS: Intake of dietary fiber is associated with reduced disease flares in patients with Crohn's disease, but not UC. Recommendations to limit dietary fiber should be re-evaluated.},

Environmental factors such as dietary patterns may increase symptoms in UC patients. AIM: To validate and implement a questionnaire to identify foods that exacerbates symptoms in UC patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted to validate and to assess the relationship of food and symptoms in Mexican UC patients. RESULTS: The IVC obtained was 0.56 in the questionnaire and kappa = 0.03 in foods from animal origin, 0.5 cereals and tubers, 0.2 legumes, 0.4 vegetables and fruits, 0.4 fats and 0.3 in others. The evaluation was carried out in UC patients (n = 233), 65% active and 35% in UC remission, the current age was 45 (SD; 15) years in active UC and 40 (SD; 15) years in UC remission. Three food groups were made based on the frequency of symptoms: Group A; symptoms more often, especially the active vs remission (P <0.05); Group B caused more symptoms in remission UC vs active UC (P = 0.07) and Group C caused more symptoms in the active UC (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Foods with higher frequency of symptoms in patients with UC were: beans, whole milk, plum, lima beans and spicy sauce.},

RESULTS: After treating with SIT and CB, the clinical symptoms of UC were markedly suppressed as shown by reduced truncated Mayo scores and medication scores. The serum levels of specific IgE, interleukin (IL)-4 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were also suppressed. Treating with SIT alone or CB alone did not show appreciable improvement of the clinical symptoms of UC. CONCLUSIONS: UC with food allergy can be ameliorated by administration with SIT and butyrate-production probiotics.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prebiotic dietary fibers resist digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract and allow for stimulation of bacteria in the distal intestine and colon. Stimulation of bacteria among different individuals varies greatly, depending on a wide range of variables. OBJECTIVE: To determine the range of differences in response between individuals, a preclinical in vitro fermentation was conducted with six fecal donors. The primary objective was to compare the fecal microbiota of six individuals at baseline, 12 h and 24 h post-exposure to partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG). METHOD: Fecal donations were collected from six healthy individuals consuming a non-specific Western diet, free of antibiotic treatments in the past year, not affected by any GI diseases and not consuming any probiotic or prebiotic supplements. Fecal samples were exposed to 0.5 g of PHGG and measured for bacterial changes at 0, 12 and 24 h based on 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Parabacteroides increased from 3.48% of sequence reads to 10.62% of sequence reads after 24 h (p = 0.0181) and Bacteroidetes increased from 45.89% of sequence reads to 50.29% of sequence reads (p = 0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: PHGG stimulates growth of Parabacteroides, a genus of bacteria that have been inversely associated with IBS and ulcerative colitis. PHGG provides stimulation of beneficial Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides and Parabacteroides), which may be correlated with many positive health markers and outcomes. PHGG is a prebiotic dietary fiber that is readily fermentable.},

The prevalence of IBD in celiac patients has been reported as 5-10 times higher than in the general population. The possibility of the presence of CD in IBD should be considered in IBD patients with long-term iron deficiency anemia (IDA) not responsive to iron supplementation. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is characterized by intestinal and extra intestinal symptoms due to the ingestion of gluten-containing food in subject without CD and/or wheat allergy. Patients with Crohn's disease and SR-NCGS were more significantly affected by joint pains compared to UC patients (50% versus 11.1%). In Crohn's patients, a higher percentage of fatigue (50% versus 38.9%) and headache (27.3% versus 22.2%) was evident. For the association between NCGS and IBD new studies are warranted and, at this moment, a gluten free diet (GFD) may be useful more in CrD than in UC.},

The antioxidant mineral selenium (Se) was measured in serum samples from 106 IBD patients (53 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 53 with Crohn's disease (CD)) and from 30 healthy controls. Serum Se concentrations were significantly lower in UC and CD patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001) and significantly lower in CD patients than in UC patients (p = 0.006). Se concentrations in patients were significantly influenced by sex, body mass index (BMI), the inflammatory biomarker alpha-1-antitrypsin, surgery, medical treatment, the severity, extent, and form of the disease and the length of time since onset (p < 0.05). Se concentrations in IBD patients were positively and linearly correlated with nutritional (protein, albumin, prealbumin, cholinesterase and total cholesterol) and iron status-related (hemoglobin, Fe and hematocrit) parameters (p < 0.05). A greater impairment of serum Se and cardiovascular status was observed in CD than in UC patients. An adequate nutritional Se status is important in IBD patients to minimize the cardiovascular risk associated with increased inflammation biomarkers, especially in undernourished CD patients, and is also related to an improved nutritional and body iron status.},

   abstract = {Diet may be a successful part of the treatment plan for improving outcome in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aimed to systematically review all published clinical trials evaluating the effects of a regular diet on symptoms of IBD. Three medical databases were searched for clinical trials evaluating an intervention that involved dietary manipulation using a regular diet on adults with IBD whose symptoms were objectively measured before and after the intervention. The most common types of regular diet interventions that we observed in the literature fell into the following three categories: low residue/low fiber diets, exclusion diets, or other specific diets. Of all included studies, the few that were of higher quality and that observed a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in the diet group compared to the control group fell under the exclusion diet group or the other specific diet group. We were able to identify several high quality clinical trials evaluating dietary manipulations on symptoms of IBD. Exclusion diets and the low FODMAP diet are two areas identified in this review that show promise for having therapeutic benefits for patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {Prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs) control cellular adaptation to hypoxia. PHDs are found involved in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, the exact role of PHD3, a member of the PHD family, in IBD remains unknown. We show here that PHD3 plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier function. We found that genetic ablation of Phd3 in intestinal epithelial cells led to spontaneous colitis in mice. Deletion of PHD3 decreases the level of tight junction protein occludin, leading to a failure of intestinal epithelial barrier function. Further studies indicate that PHD3 stabilizes occludin by preventing the interaction between the E3 ligase Itch and occludin, in a hydroxylase-independent manner. Examination of biopsy of human ulcerative colitis patients indicates that PHD3 is decreased with disease severity, indicating that PHD3 down-regulation is associated with progression of this disease. We show that PHD3 protects intestinal epithelial barrier function and reveal a hydroxylase-independent function of PHD3 in stabilizing occludin. These findings may help open avenues for developing a therapeutic strategy for IBD.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic, relapsing inflammatory bowel diseases associated with significant morbidity. Conventional therapies for these diseases include corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies. Over the years tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists alone or in combination with other therapies have emerged as the cornerstone of treatment for induction and maintenance of remission of moderate to severe UC and CD. Unfortunately, some patients with moderate to severe UC and CD are unable to attain or maintain remission with TNF-alpha antagonist treatment. Vedolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is the first integrin receptor antagonist approved that selectively antagonizes alpha4beta7 gastrointestinal integrin receptors. US Food and Drug Administration approval is for treatment of patients with moderate to severe active UC and CD who have inadequate response with, lost response to, or are intolerant to a TNF-alpha antagonist or an immunomodulator; or have inadequate response with, are intolerant to, or demonstrate dependence on corticosteroids. When administered according to approved dosing in patients with moderate to severe CD and UC, vedolizumab induces clinical response rates up to 31.4% and 47.1% at week 6, and clinical remission rates up to 39% and 41.8% at week 52, respectively. Serious adverse events reported with vedolizumab include serious infections, malignancies, and anaphylaxis. Since vedolizumab is gastrointestinal selective, to date, it has not shown evidence of causing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; however, postmarketing studies monitoring for this adverse effect are ongoing. Further assessment of vedolizumab earlier in the course of these diseases and in combination with other therapies is warranted.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Plant-based diets (PBDs) are a healthy alternative to westernized diets. A semivegetarian diet, a PBD, has been shown to prevent a relapse in Crohn disease. However, there is no way to measure adherence to PBDs. OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple way of evaluating adherence to a PBD for Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). DESIGN: PBD scores were assigned according to the frequency of consumption provided on a food-frequency questionnaire, obtained on hospitalization for 159 patients with ulcerative colitis and 70 patients with Crohn disease. Eight items considered to be preventive factors for IBD were scored positively, and 8 items considered to be IBD risk factors were scored negatively. The PBD score was calculated from the sum of plus and minus scores. Higher PBD scores indicated greater adherence to a PBD. The PBD scores were evaluated on hospitalization and 2 years after discharge for 22 patients with Crohn disease whose dietary pattern and prognosis were established. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Plant-Based Diet score. RESULTS: The PBD scores differed significantly, in descending order, by dietary type: pro-Japanese diet, mixed type, and pro-westernized diet (Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test). The PBD scores in the ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease groups were 10.9 +/- 9.5 and 8.2 +/- 8.2, respectively. For patients with Crohn disease, those with long-term remission and normal C-reactive protein concentration were significantly more likely to have PBD scores of 25 or greater than below 25 (chi2). CONCLUSION: The PBD score is a valid assessment of PBD dietary adherence.},

Interaction of the gut microbiota on the host inflammatory response has suggested that alternative therapies, such as probiotics, might have a complementary role in treating and preventing disease flares. Multiple probiotics and their formulations have been studied for both the induction and maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis (UC); however, mainly Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and VSL#3 have been shown to provide significant benefits for the prevention and treatment of mild to moderate UC. Although these data are promising, there is still a paucity of robust, randomized-controlled trials to suggest that probiotics be utilized as part of a standard treatment regimen. With continued research and a movement toward carefully selected, individualized management based on an individual's specific microbiota composition and function, probiotics may become an integral part of tailored therapy for UC.},

   abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Water extract of Raphanus sativus L. (RSL) seeds was traditionally used to treat digestive inflammatory complaints in Korean culture. RSL seeds exerted antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-septic functions, suggesting their pharmacological potential for the treatment of inflammatory pathologies associated with oxidative stress such as inflammatory bowel disease. AIM OF THIS STUDY: We evaluated the intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of RSL seed water extract (RWE) in experimental rat models of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS)- or dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RWE was characterized by determining the content of sinapic acid as a reference material and then assayed in the DSS and TNBS models of rat colitis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 10 groups (n=7/group): non-colitic control, DSS or TNBS control, DSS colitis groups treated with RWE (100mg/kg) or mesalazine (25mg/kg), and TNBS colitis groups treated with various doses (10, 40, 70, and 100mg/kg) of RWE or mesalazine (25mg/kg). RWE or mesalazine treatment started the same day of colitis induction and rats were sacrificed 24h after the last treatment followed by histological and biochemical analyses. RESULTS: Oral administration with RWE suppressed intestinal inflammatory damages in both DSS- and TNBS-induced colitic rats. The treatment with 100mg/kg RWE recovered intestinal damages caused by TNBS or DSS to levels similar to that of mesalazine, decreasing the activity of myeloperoxidase activity and the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta. RWE treatment inhibited malondialdehyde production and glutathione reduction in colon of colitis rats. The administration of RWE at dose of 100mg/kg also suppressed the TNBS- or DSS-stimulated expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, inducible nitric oxide, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Furthermore, RWE inhibited p38 kinase and DNA-nuclear factor-kappaB binding activities, both of which were stimulated in the colitic rats. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings show that RWE ameliorates intestinal oxidative and inflammatory damages in DSS and TNBS models of rat colitis, suggesting its beneficial use for the treatment of intestinal inflammatory disorders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mast cells in the gut play an important role in the innate and adaptive immune responses that are relevant to human inflammatory bowel disease. However, the contribution of mast cells to the development of inflammatory bowel disease is not well understood. This study aimed to determine the role of mast cells in oxazolone-induced colitis and to explore whether the mast cell membrane stabiliser tranilast could ameliorate colonic inflammation. METHODS: Wild-type rats and mast cell-deficient rats were sensitised and challenged with oxazolone, then treated with tranilast after challenge. Controls were treated with saline. RESULTS: Mast cell-deficient rats presented a weak response to oxazolone, while wild-type rats showed severe ulcerative colitis after stimulation with oxazolone. The mast cell-deficient rats model had a significantly lower disease activity index score than wild-type rats model (1.8+/-1.64 vs. 8.3+/-0.58 respectively; P<0.01). Tranilast could reduce the secretion of cytokines, immunoglobulins and myeloperoxidase activity in tranilast treatment groups compared with the model group. The number of mast cells in the wild-type model was higher than in the other groups. There was no significant change in mast cell-deficient rats. CONCLUSION: Mast cells play an important role in oxazolone-induced colitis. The mast cell membrane stabiliser tranilast can ameliorate oxazolone-induced colitis via a mast cell-dependent pathway.},

   abstract = {Isotretinoin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1982 and revolutionized acne therapy. Soon afterwards, case reports appeared suggesting a link between inflammatory bowel disease and use of isotretinoin. As reviewed in this article, an increasing number of case-control and prospective (cohort) studies have been reported that examined associations between use of isotretinoin and inflammatory bowel disease. Published epidemiologic studies of the use of isotretinoin and risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis vary according to whether the design was a case-control study or cohort study and by other important design differences. The strengths and limitations of the studies, such as their ability to control for important confounding variables (e.g., the severity of acne and use of antibiotics), also differ widely. Results across epidemiologic studies have been inconsistent and most studies have not found a strong association or a dose-response relationship. Based upon results from laboratory studies, several biological mechanisms have been proposed to account for either a positive (pathogenic) or inverse (protective) association between isotretinoin and inflammatory bowel disease. Although epidemiologic study findings are generally consistent with a correct temporal relationship (i.e., exposure to isotretinoin preceded the onset of inflammatory bowel disease), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis often have an insidious onset with some symptoms occurring well before a clinical diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease is made. Taken overall, results from epidemiologic (case-control and cohort) studies completed to date do not show a consistent association between isotretinoin use and risk of inflammatory bowel disease. There is no clear evidence of a causal link.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The stability and composition of intestinal flora plays a vital role in human wellbeing throughout life from as early as birth. Over the past 50 years, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of probiotic administration in pediatric gastroenterology. This document aims to provide a recommendation score on probiotic utilization in pediatric gastroenterology, together with a review of current knowledge concerning its benefits, tolerability, and safety. STUDY DESIGN: Published literature was selected without study design restriction: clinical guidelines, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, outcomes research and case-controlled studies were selected using the following MESH-validated terms: probiotics, diarrhea, acute diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, bacterial diarrhea, nosocomial diarrhea, prophylactic diarrhea, Helicobacter pylori infection, colic, infantile colic, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), inflammatory bowel disease, constipation, and allergy. Once the validity and the quality of results were evaluated, a recommendation score and level of evidence were assigned for pediatric gastrointestinal-related conditions, according to the updated Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines: 1a for systematic review (SR) of RCTs, 1b for individual RCT, 1c for SR and individual RCT, 2a for SR of cohort studies, 2b for individual cohort studies, 2c for outcomes research, and 3a for SR of case-control studies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Latin American Expert group consensus recommends the use of the following probiotics for pediatric gastrointestinal conditions: prevention of acute infectious diarrhea (AID): 1b for Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), and L. reuteri; prevention of nosocomial diarrhea: 1 b for B. lactis Bb12, B. bifidum, LGG and Streptococcus thermophiles; treatment of AID: 1a for LGG and S. boulardii, 1b for L. reuteri; prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: 1b for LGG and S. boulardii; prevention of traveler's diarrhea: 1b for S. boulardii; prevention of infantile colic: 1a for L. reuteri DSM 17938; treatment of infantile colic: 1b for L. reuteri DSM 17938; prevention of NEC: 1a for B. breve, mixtures of Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus, LGG, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri DSM 17938; induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis: 1b for VSL#3; improving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome: 2c for LGG and VSL#3.},

   abstract = {AIM: To analyze the changes of different Lactobacillus species in ulcerative colitis patients and to further assess the therapeutic effects of selected Lactobacillus strains on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis in BALB/c mice. METHODS: Forty-five active ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and 45 population-based healthy controls were enrolled. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and real-time PCR were performed for qualitative and quantitative analyses, respectively, of the Lactobacillus species in UC patients. Three Lactobacillus strains from three species were selected to assess the therapeutic effects on experimental colitis. Sixty 8-week-old BALB/c mice were divided into six groups. The five groups that had received DSS were administered normal saline, mesalazine, L. fermentum CCTCC M206110 strain, L. crispatus CCTCC M206119 strain, or L. plantarum NCIMB8826 strain. We assessed the severity of colitis based on disease activity index (DAI), body weight loss, colon length, and histologic damage. RESULTS: The detection rate of four of the 11 Lactobacillus species decreased significantly (P < 0.05), and the detection rate of two of the 11 Lactobacillus species increased significantly (P < 0.05) in UC patients. Relative quantitative analysis revealed that eight Lactobacillus species declined significantly in UC patients (P < 0.05), while three Lactobacillus species increased significantly (P < 0.05). The CCTCC M206110 treatment group had less weight loss and colon length shortening, lower DAI scores, and lower histologic scores (P < 0.05), while the CCTCC M206119 treatment group had greater weight loss and colon length shortening, higher histologic scores, and more severe inflammatory infiltration (P < 0.05). NCIMB8826 improved weight loss and colon length shortening (P < 0.05) with no significant influence on DAI and histologic damage in the colitis model. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of an L. crispatus CCTCC M206119 supplement aggravated DSS-induced colitis. L. fermentum CCTCC M206110 proved to be effective at attenuating DSS-induced colitis. The potential probiotic effect of L. plantarum NCIMB8826 on UC has yet to be assessed.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Phyllanthus niruri L. belongs to the Euphorbiaceae, and is known by the common name of 'stonebreaker' in Brazil. Some species within the Phyllanthus genus are widely used in traditional medicine to counteract different types of anti-inflammatory diseases. OBJECTIVES: In this study, the preventive intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of spray-dried extract of P. niruri (SDEPn) was tested in the model of acetic acid (10%)-induced ulcerative colitis in the rat. METHODS: Colitis animals were given orally at doses 25, 100 and 200 mg/kg. Colons tissue was analysed by macroscopic score, by histopathology score, by the immunohistochemical examination of tumour necrosis factor alpha, p53 and interferon gamma; by spectroscopic ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry (UV/VIS) analysis of the levels of myeloperoxidase, malonaldehyde and total glutathione. KEY FINDINGS/RESULT: Pretreatment of the extract to colitic rats significantly attenuated colonic macroscopic damage induced by acetic acid (P < 0.01). Spray-dried extract of P. niruri prevented glutathione depletion (P < 0.001) and malondialdehyde levels (P < 0.05) declined. Spray-dried extract of P. niruri significantly reduced microscopic damage to tissues, such as leukocyte infiltration accompanied by a significant reduction in myeloperoxidase activity (P < 0.5). Immunohistochemistry revealed a decline in the TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and p53 protein (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Spray-dried extract of P. niruri has a beneficial effect in the acute phase of acetic acid-induced colitis in the rat, which is probably related to its antioxidant properties.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacteria play a role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in IBD. Compositional alterations may also change the metabolic capacities of the gut bacteria. OBJECTIVE: To examine the metabolic activity of the microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), UC or pouchitis compared with healthy controls (HC) and determine whether eventual differences might be related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained from 40 HC, 83 patients with CD, 68 with UC and 13 with pouchitis. Disease activity was assessed in CD using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, in UC using the UC Disease Activity Index and in pouchitis using the Pouchitis Disease Activity Index. Metabolite profiles were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of metabolites identified in HC (54) was significantly higher than in patients with CD (44, p<0.001), UC (47, p=0.042) and pouchitis (43, p=0.036). Multivariate discriminant analysis predicted HC, CD, UC and pouchitis group membership with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs: pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate and nonanoate), and of some protein fermentation metabolites, were significantly decreased in patients with CD, UC and pouchitis. Hexanoate levels were inversely correlated to disease activity in CD (correlation coefficient=-0.157, p=0.046), whereas a significant positive correlation was found between styrene levels and disease activity in UC (correlation coefficient=0.338, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Faecal metabolic profiling in patients with IBD relative to healthy controls identified MCFAs as important metabolic biomarkers of disease-related changes.

   abstract = {The intestinal microbiota is one of the key players in the etiology of ulcerative colitis. Manipulation of this microflora with probiotics and prebiotics is an attractive strategy in the management of ulcerative colitis. Several intervention studies for both the induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis patients have been performed. Most of these studies evaluated VSL#3 or E. Coli Nissle 1917 and in general there is evidence for efficacy of these agents for induction and maintenance of remission. However, studies are frequently underpowered, lack a control group, and are very heterogeneous investigating different probiotic strains in different study populations. The absence of well-powered robust randomized placebo-controlled trials impedes the widespread use of probiotics and prebiotics in ulcerative colitis. However, given the promising results that are currently available, probiotics and prebiotics may find their way to the treatment algorithm for ulcerative colitis in the near future.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and an unspecific IBD. The unclear etiology of IBD is a limiting factor that complicates the development of new pharmacological treatments and explains the high frequency of refractory patients to current drugs, including both conventional and biological therapies. In view of this, recent progress on the development of novel patented products to treat IBD was reviewed. AREAS COVERED: Evaluation of the patent literature during the period 2013 - 2014 focused on chemical compounds, functional foods and biological therapy useful for the treatment of IBD. EXPERT OPINION: Majority of the patents are not conclusive because they were based on data from unspecific methods not related to intestinal inflammation and, when related to IBD models, few biochemical and molecular evaluations that could be corroborating their use in human IBD were presented. On the other hand, methods and strategies using new formulations of conventional drugs, guanylyl cyclase C peptide agonists, compounds that influence anti-adhesion molecules, mAbs anti-type I interferons and anti-integrin, oligonucleotide antisense Smad7, growth factor neuregulin 4 and functional foods, particularly fermented wheat germ with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are promising products for use in the very near future.},

   abstract = {Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC). Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Akkermansia muciniphila and Desulfovibrio spp. are commensal microbes colonising the mucus gel layer of the colon. Both species have the capacity to utilise colonic mucin as a substrate. A. muciniphila degrades colonic mucin, while Desulfovibrio spp. metabolise the sulfate moiety of sulfated mucins. Altered abundances of these microorganisms have been reported in ulcerative colitis (UC). However their capacity to bind to human colonic mucin, and whether this binding capacity is affected by changes in mucin associated with UC, remain to be defined. METHODS: Mucin was isolated from resected colon from control patients undergoing resection for colonic cancer (n = 7) and patients undergoing resection for UC (n = 5). Isolated mucin was purified and printed onto mucin microarrays. Binding of reference strains and three clinical isolates of A. muciniphila and Desulfovibrio spp. to purified mucin was investigated. RESULTS: Both A. muciniphila and Desulfovibro spp. bound to mucin. The reference strain and all clinical isolates of A. muciniphila showed increased binding capacity for UC mucin (p < .005). The Desulfovibrio reference strain showed increased affinity for UC mucin. The mucin binding profiles of clinical isolates of Desulfovibrio spp. were specific to each isolate. Two isolates showed no difference in binding. One UC isolate bound with increased affinity to UC mucin (p < .005). CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that differences exist in the mucin binding capacity of isolates of A. muciniphila and Desulfovibrio spp. This study highlights the mucin microarray platform as a means of studying the ability of bacteria to interact with colonic mucin in health and disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory conditions, characterised by remissions and relapses episodes, whose main manifestations are ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis (UC), one of the main forms of IBD, has as standard treatment the use of corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory drugs. The use of antibiotics has been also reported, but the possible adverse effects, such as disturbance of the indigenous microbiota or resistance induction, should be taken into consideration, and thus the use of probiotics emerges as a possible alternative option of treatment. In this study, the oral administration of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis BB-02 was evaluated as a preventive strategy for acute experimental UC induced in female BALB/c mice by ingestion of 3.5% dextran sulphate sodium in drinking water during 7 days. During this time, the daily disease activity index was evaluated, and on the seventh day the animals were euthanised to collect intestines and liver for analysis. Treatment with the probiotic resulted in clinical improvement of the animals. The histological and morphometric analyses showed a reduction of lesions and oedema in the gut, but there was no increase in the production of mucin. The dosage of secretory immunoglobulin A was significantly higher in the colitis group and reduced in the group treated with the probiotic. There was also a reduction in the inflammation of the colon, as demonstrated by a decrease in neutrophils infiltration, and KC/CXCL-1 levels. The intestinal permeability, which is typically increased during the onset of IBD, was also reduced by treatment with probiotic. Based on these data, it can be concluded that the bacterium B. infantis BB-02 has a probiotic potential for the attenuation of UC, but further studies should be conducted to verify the mechanism of protective action of the bacterium.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Anxiety, depression, and altered memory are associated with intestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Understanding the link between these behavioral changes and IBD is important clinically since concomitant mood disorders often increase a patient's risk of requiring surgery and developing secondary functional gastrointestinal diseases. Anxiety-like behavior (light/dark box test) and recognition memory (novel object recognition task) were determined at the peak and during resolution of inflammation in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) mouse model of acute colitis. DSS (5 days) was administered via drinking water followed by 3 or 9 days of normal drinking water to assess behavior during active or resolving inflammation, respectively. Disease (weight, colon length, and histology) was assessed and the composition of the gut microbiota was characterized by using qPCR on fecal pellet DNA. In a subset of mice, pretreatment with probiotics was started 1 wk prior to commencing DSS. During active inflammation (8 days), mice demonstrated impaired recognition memory and exhibited anxiety-like behavior vs. CONTROLS: These behavioral defects were normalized by 14 days post-DSS. Shifts in the composition of the gut microbiota were evident during active inflammation, notably as decreases in lactobacilli and segmented filamentous bacteria, which were also reversed once the disease had resolved. Administration of probiotics could prevent the behavioral defects seen in acute DSS. Taken together, our findings indicate that changes in mood and behavior are present during acute inflammation in murine IBD and associated with dysbiosis and that these outcomes can be prevented by the administration of probiotics.},

   abstract = {Melatonin is produced in the pineal gland as well as many other organs, including the enterochromaffin cells of the digestive mucosa. Melatonin is a powerful antioxidant that resists oxidative stress due to its capacity to directly scavenge reactive species, to modulate the antioxidant defense system by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and to stimulate the innate immune response through its direct and indirect actions. In addition, the dysregulation of the circadian system is observed to be related with alterations in colonic motility and cell disruptions due to the modifications of clock genes expression. In the gastrointestinal tract, the activities of melatonin are mediated by melatonin receptors (MT2), serotonin (5-HT), and cholecystokinin B (CCK2) receptors and via receptor-independent processes. The levels of melatonin in the gastrointestinal tract exceed by 10-100 times the blood concentrations. Also, there is an estimated 400 times more melatonin in the gut than in the pineal gland. Gut melatonin secretion is suggested to be influenced by the food intake. Low dose melatonin treatment accelerates intestinal transit time whereas high doses may decrease gut motility. Melatonin has been studied as a co-adjuvant treatment in several gastrointestinal diseases including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis. The purpose of this review is to provide information regarding the potential benefits of melatonin as a co-adjuvant treatment in gastrointestinal diseases, especially IBS, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis.},

   abstract = {The present study investigated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of dietary protocatechuic acid (PCA), a simple hydrophilic phenolic compound commonly found in many edible vegetables, on dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis and its associated hepatotoxicity in rats. PCA was administered orally at 10 mg kg(-1) to dextran sulphate sodium exposed rats for five days. The result revealed that administration of PCA significantly (p < 0.05) prevented the incidence of diarrhea and bleeding, the decrease in the body weight gain, shortening of colon length and the increase in colon mass index in DSS-treated rats. Furthermore, PCA prevented the increase in the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, markers of liver toxicity and markedly suppressed the DSS-mediated elevation in colonic nitric oxide concentration and myeloperoxidase activity in the treated rats. Administration of PCA significantly protected against colonic and hepatic oxidative damage by increasing the antioxidant status and concomitantly decreased hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation levels in the DSS-treated rats. Moreover, histological examinations confirmed PCA chemoprotection against colon and liver damage. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that PCA significantly inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expression in the colon of DSS-treated rats. In conclusion, the effective chemoprotective role of PCA in colitis and the associated hepatotoxicity is related to its intrinsic anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties.},

METHODS: A search of the Internet as well as PubMed was conducted through August 2014 for information related to the clinical use of biosimilars in chronic inflammatory disorders using the keywords biosimilar, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) websites were searched for biosimilar guidelines. RESULTS: Articles and guidelines relating to integrating biosimilars into the clinical management of patients with inflammatory disorders have been published by regulatory agencies, professional associations, healthcare providers, and others. CONCLUSIONS: The recent approval of the biosimilar infliximab in some countries makes biosimilars a reality for rheumatologists and others involved in the care of patients with inflammatory disorders. To successfully and confidently integrate biosimilars into clinical practice, physicians must understand factors such as variation in innovator/reference products, extrapolation of data, naming and labeling, interchangeability and automatic substitution, and pharmacovigilance.},

   abstract = {Alterations of intestinal microflora may significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of different inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. There is emerging interest on the role of selective modulation of microflora in inducing benefits in inflammatory intestinal disorders, by as probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). To summarize recent evidences on microflora modulation in main intestinal inflammatory disorders, PubMed was searched using terms microbiota, intestinal flora, probiotics, prebiotics, fecal transplantation. More than three hundred articles published up to 2015 were selected and reviewed. Randomized placebo-controlled trials and meta-analysis were firstly included, mainly for probiotics. A meta-analysis was not performed because of the heterogeneity of these studies. Most of relevant data derived from studies on probiotics, reporting some efficacy in ulcerative colitis and in pouchitis, while disappointing results are available for Crohn's disease. Probiotic supplementation may significantly reduce rates of rotavirus diarrhea. Efficacy of probiotics in NSAID enteropathy and irritable bowel syndrome is still controversial. Finally, FMT has been recently recognized as an efficacious treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. Modulation of intestinal flora represents a very interesting therapeutic target, although it still deserves some doubts and limitations. Future studies should be encouraged to provide new understanding about its therapeutical role.},

   abstract = {In Digestive Disease Week 2016, interesting data were presented on the eventual role of certain foods in inflammatory bowel disease, although the value of these data is relative. Also of interest were epidemiological studies, of which several analysed the natural history of the disease. Some presentations dealt with the search for individual predictive factors, a pressing need in clinical practice. Unfortunately, some of the findings presented were of dubious value. A study suggesting that a simple parameter as increased blood monocytes could be a clear predictive factor of poor outcome could perhaps be highlighted (the results were striking but had multiple limitations). In contrast, more interesting data were presented on monitoring and optimising biological therapy in the search for an individually-tailored approach. New studies were presented on the levels of distinct anti-TNF agents, vedolizumab and even ustekinumab. One study aimed to estimate the safety of anti-TNF agents on the basis of the patient's genetic (and clinical) features. There is no new evidence that will change our clinical practice. Equally, the data on colon cancer prevention will not modify our clinical practice, although one study reported a promising new strategy, consisting of the use of a new stool DNA test, with very promising results in the detection of high-grade dysplasia or colorectal cancer in these patients.},

Rats were divided into seven groups. Four groups received oral P. atlantica, butyrate, L. casei and the combination of three agents for 10 consecutive days. The remaining groups were negative and positive controls and a sham group. Macroscopic and histopathological examinations were carried out along with determination of the specific biomarker of colonic oxidative stress, the myeloperoxidase (MPO). Compared with controls, the combination therapy exhibited a significant alleviation of colitis in terms of pathological scores and reduction of MPO activity (55%, p=0.0009). Meanwhile, the macroscopic appearance such as stool consistency, tissue and histopathological scores (edema, necrosis and neutrophil infiltration) were improved. Although single therapy by each P. atlantica, butyrate, and L. casei was partially beneficial in reduction of colon oxidative stress markers, the combination therapy was much more effective. In conclusion, the combination therapy was able to reduce the severity of colitis that is clear from biochemical markers. Future studies have to focus on clinical effects of this combination in management of human ulcerative colitis. Further molecular and signaling pathway studies will help to understand the mechanisms involved in the treatment of colitis and inflammatory diseases.},

   abstract = {Oral prescription medical foods have long been used in hospital settings but are also appropriate therapies for gastrointestinal disorders in outpatient medical practice. Oral serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) has been shown in clinical studies to reduce loose stools and improve stool consistency as well as other symptoms (i.e., abdominal pain, bloating, and urgency) in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and human immunodeficiency virus-associated enteropathy. This case series reports the outcomes of 14 IBS patients who received SBI as an addition to standard of care at an individual physician's clinical practice. The patients: 2 IBS with constipation (IBS-C), 7 IBS-D, 2 mixed diarrhea and constipation IBS (IBS-M) and 3 undefined IBS (IBS-U; also described by some physicians as IBS-Bloating), ranged in age from 22-87 years. SBI (5 g or 10 g daily dose) was added to the patient's current standard care and followed for several weeks to determine if symptoms were improved with the addition of SBI. Overall, 12 of the 14 patients indicated some level of improvement through direct questioning of the patients regarding changes from the prior visit. One IBS-Bloating patient had a resolution of symptoms and two patients (1 IBS-Bloating and 1 IBS-C) discontinued therapy because of insufficient relief. The 12 patients who continued on therapy reported an overall improvement in symptoms with better stool consistency, decreased frequency as well as reductions in abdominal pain, bloating, distention, and incontinence. In most cases, therapeutic effects of SBI were seen within the first four weeks of therapy with continued improvements at subsequent visits. SBI has a multifaceted mechanism of action and may help to manage IBS by providing a distinct protein source required to normalize bowel function, gastrointestinal microbiota, and nutritionally enhance tight junction protein expression between intestinal epithelial cells. SBI as a medical food provides a safe option for patients with IBS-D but may have application in other forms of IBS.},

   abstract = {Terminal ileitis (TI) is an inflammatory condition of the terminal portion of the ileum that may occur acutely with right lower quadrant pain followed or not by diarrhea, or exhibit chronic obstructive symptoms and bleeding and normally it is associated to Crohn's disease (CD) although it may be associated to other different conditions. This review intended to contribute to a better understanding of TI in order to help in the diagnosis, medical approach and patient care. This work was performed on a survey of articles collected in different databases and a retrospective search was carried out to identify relevant studies in the field. Pathological conditions such as ulcerative colitis, the intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, infectious diseases, eosinophilic enteritis, malignant diseases, spondyloarthropathies, vasculitides, ischemia, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis and others may be related to ileitis but it is commonly referred to CD. To a correct therapeutic approach, it is necessary to understand the causes of this inflammation process. The performance of a clinical, laboratory, endoscopic, and histopathological evaluation of the individuals is crucial to the correct diagnosis and treatment once the inflammation of the ileum may occur due to different pathological conditions besides CD, leading to difficulties in the diagnosis. Thus, an individual approach is necessary once the correct diagnosis is crucial for the immediate therapeutic approach and recovering of the patient.},

   abstract = {Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated to a change in stool consistency or frequency, include low-grade inflammation and intestinal microbiota changes. Few and disappointing data are available for prebiotics. A few controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics are instead available with favourable effects, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. A recent report from the Rome foundation group included 32 RCTs of probiotics, most of which showed an overall modest improvement in symptoms, with the patients most benefitting from probiotics being those with predominant diarrhoea and those having a post-infectious IBS. A review focusing only on children with functional gastrointestinal disorders concluded that probiotics are more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders, although no effect on constipation was evident. The role for probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears logical: the endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a central role in their development, and various probiotics have been found effective in animal models of IBD. However, research in humans has been overall quite limited, and it would seem that after a phase of intense research in the first decade of this century, the pace has slowed down, with fewer clinical trials been published in the past 2-3 years. To summarize current evidence: no probiotic has proven successful in Crohn's disease. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, data are more promising, and a very recent meta-analysis, that included 23 randomized controlled trials, concluded that there is evidence of efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in helping inducing and maintaining remission, as well as in maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis. It is fair to state that for both IBD and IBS, more well-designed, rigorous, randomized clinical trials must be performed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telmisartan is an antihypertensive angiotensin II receptor blocker. This antihypertensive shows antiinflammatory activity. PURPOSE: In this study, the antiinflammatory activity of telmisartan was tested in an acetic acid (10%) model of ulcerative colitis (UC) in rats. METHODS: Rats were given 1, 3, and 5mg/kg/day of telmisartan orally for 3 days before induction of UC. The same doses were also administered 2 and 24h after induction. Rats from the non-colitis and non-treated colitis groups were administered vehicle (saline, 5 ml/kg) orally and another group received sulfasalazine (50mg/kg/day). Colons tissue was analyzed by macroscopic, by histopathology, by the immunohistochemical examination of RANKL/RANK pathway; by ELISA analysis of the levels of IL-10, TNF-alpha, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and malonaldehyde (MDA). RESULTS: Telmisartan at 5mg/kg reduced levels of MPO, MDA, TNF-alpha and increased of IL-10 (p<0.05). Additionally, telmisartan reduced macroscopic damage, number of ulcers, and inflammatory and histopathological processes such as neutrophil infiltration, changes in cytoarchitecture, and necrosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed down-regulation of nuclear factor-kappaB receptor/nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANK/RANKL) in groups treated with sulfasalazine or telmisartan. CONCLUSION: Telmisartan exerts beneficial effects in an acetic acid model of colitis in rats. These effects may be due to accelerated termination of the acute inflammatory phase, indicated by decreased TNF-alpha and increased production of IL-10 and low expression of RANKL and RANK.},

   abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Many Chinese herbs are traditionally used as medicine to improve the functions of gastrointestinal tract. Some of these herbs are also promising agents for the improvement of the gut microbiota and the treatment of ulcerative colitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By screening seven traditional Chinese herbs, we found that Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis were the most effective in promoting the growth of probiotics including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in vitro. We then evaluated the effects of Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis on the growth of the bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella spp.) in vitro. In in vivo experiment, we gavage administrated trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid induced ulcerative colitis (UC) rats with Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis extracts. After two weeks treatment, we analyzed the structure of the gut microbiota and examined the UC symptoms by employing qPCR and animal pathology detection techniques. RESULTS: Both Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis promoted the growth of probiotics - Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in vitro. Red Ginseng also inhibited the growth of some pathogen strains. In vivo, Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis improved the structure of gut microbiota and relieved the symptoms of ulcerative colitis in vivo. Compared with Semen Coicis, Red Ginseng was more effective in relieving the symptoms of ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Red Ginseng could promote the growth of probiotic bacteria in vitro. Red Ginseng and, to a lesser extent Semen Coicis, gave positive results in an experimental in vivo model for ulcerative colitis.},

In the maintenance treatment of inactive Crohn's disease probiotics, when administered alone, were found ineffective in preventing clinical and/or endoscopic recurrence. By contrast, a combination of a probiotic agent (eg, Saccharomyces boulardii) with standard pharmacological therapy can promote clinical benefit.

On April 5, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration concurred with this recommendation and approved CT-P13 (Inflectra; Pfizer Inc.) for all diseases for which infliximab had previously been approved, including adult and pediatric moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and pediatric and adult moderate to severe and fistulizing Crohn's disease. This was despite the absence of any randomized controlled trials studying the infliximab biosimilar in any inflammatory bowel disease. This highly controversial approach has been criticized by various rheumatology and gastroenterology professional societies around the world. This review will cover the stepwise approach to biosimilar development, issues of extrapolation and interchangeability, and conclude with a discussion of the regulatory, intellectual property issues, and financial implications, which will all intersect in the decision and ability to prescribe a biosimilar or reference anti-tumor necrosis factor drug.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the colonic mucosa. Administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to animals is a frequently used model to mimic human colitis. Deregulation of the immune response to the enteric microflora or pathogens as well as increased intestinal permeability have been proposed as disease-driving mechanisms. To enlarge the understanding of the pathogenesis, we have studied the effect of DSS on the immune system and gut microbiota in mice. Intestinal inflammation was verified through histological evaluation and myeloperoxidase activity. Immunological changes were assessed by flow cytometry in spleen, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes and through multiplex cytokine profiling. In addition, quantification of the total amount of bacteria on colonic mucosa as well as the total amount of lactobacilli, Akkermansia, Desulfovibrio and Enterobacteriaceae was performed by the use of quantitative PCR. Diversity and community structure were analysed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) patterns, and principal component analysis was utilized on immunological and T-RFLP patterns. DSS-induced colitis show clinical and histological similarities to UC. The composition of the colonic microflora was profoundly changed and correlated with several alterations of the immune system. The results demonstrate a relationship between multiple immunological changes and alterations of the gut microbiota after DSS administration. These data highlight and improve the definition of the immunological basis of the disease and suggest a role for dysregulation of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of colitis.},

   abstract = {Intestinal permeability plays a critical role in the etiopathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. Defensins, including porcine beta-defensin (pBD)2, are crucial antimicrobial peptides for gut protection owing to their antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of pBD2 on mucosal injury and the disruption of the epithelial barrier during the pathological process of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. The effects and mechanism of pBD2 were evaluated both using a DSS-induced C57BL/6 mouse model and, in vitro, using Caco-2 and RAW264.7 cells. DSS-induced colitis was characterized by higher disease activity index, shortened colon length, elevated activities of myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase, histologic evidence of inflammation, and increased expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8. pBD2 increased the expression of zonula occludens-1, zonula occludens-2, claudin-1, mucin-1, and mucin-2 mRNA and proteins, and it decreased permeability to FITC-D, as well as apoptosis, in DSS-treated mice. pBD2 also decreased inflammatory infiltrates of the colon epithelium. In Caco-2 cells, pBD2 increased transepithelial electrical resistance and mucin mRNA expression, and it decreased the permeability of FITC-D while preserving the structural integrity of the tight junctions. The effects of pBD2 appeared to be through upregulation of the expression of genes associated with tight junctions and mucins, and by suppressing DSS-induced increases in inflammation, inducible NO synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and apoptosis. These results show that pBD2 improves DSS-induced changes in mucosal lesions and paracellular permeability, possibly by affecting the activation of NF-kappaB signaling. The present study demonstrates that intrarectal administration of pBD2 may be a novel preventive option for ulcerative colitis.},

We aimed to study food intake in children with IBD and evaluated the relation of dietary intake with disease activity and nutritional status in these children. METHODS: This cross-sectional study investigated 68 children and adolescents with IBD (57 Crohn disease, 11 ulcerative colitis). Evaluation included clinical, laboratory, and nutritional assessment including 3 days diet record. RESULTS: Compared with recommended daily allowance, the intake of patients with IBD was significantly poor for carbohydrates (75%, P = 0.016), calcium (49%, P < 0.05), magnesium (76%, P < 0.05), vitamin A (72%, P < 0.05), vitamin E (57%, P < 0.05), and fiber (44%, P < 0.05) and higher for protein (175%, P < 0.05), iron (112%, P < 0.05), and water-soluble vitamins (118%-189% P < 0.05). Compared with the intakes of healthy children from National Nutritional Survey, the intake of IBD group was lower for calories (78%, P = 0.012), carbohydrates (61% P < 0.05), magnesium (67% P < 0.05), vitamin C (34%, P < 0.05), and fiber (54%, P < 0.05) and high for B12 (141%, P < 0.05). Fifty subjects ate ordinary diets, 7 of 68 children were on exclusive enteral nutrition and 11 of 68 consumed regular food with different polymeric formulas supplements. Compared with children without supplements, children on exclusive enteral nutrition and nutritional supplements (18/68) had significantly better intakes of energy (1870 +/- 755 vs 2267 +/- 432, P < 0.05), carbohydrates (223 +/- 97 vs 292 +/- 99, P < 0.05), and all minerals (P < 0.05) and micronutrients (P < 0.05). Dietary intake was not different by disease status (remission or relapse). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of nutritional supplements, food intake is inadequate for many nutrients in many children with IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The interaction between a disturbed microbial composition, the intestinal mucosal barrier and the mucosal immune system plays an important role in IBD and its chronicity. It has been indicated that due to the altered microbial composition the balance between T regulatory cells (Treg) and T helper cells (Th) 17 is disturbed, leading to an inflammatory state. The present study shows that oral intake of a specific multi fibre mix (MF), designed to match the fibre content of a healthy diet, counteracts IBD-like intestinal inflammation and weight loss in dextran sodium sulphate treated mice. This reduction in inflammation might be brought about, at least in part, by the MF-induced decrease in inflammatory cytokines, increase in IL-10 and the relative increase in Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Moreover, the Treg percentage in the MLN correlates with the percentage of tolerogenic lamina propria derived CD103+RALDH+dendritic cells in the MLN, suggesting that these play a role in the observed effects. In children with CD exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a widely used safe and effective therapy. Optimizing enteral nutritional concepts with the tested fibre mix, know to modulate the gut microbiota composition, SCFA production and inflammatory status (as indicated by the present study) could possibly further improve efficacy in inducing remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The north-south geographical gradient of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) prevalence, its epidemiology, the genetic association of vitamin D receptor polymorphisms, and results in animal models suggest that vitamin D plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD. AIMS: The purpose of this review was to critically appraise the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D therapy in patients with IBD. METHODS: MEDLINE, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched from inception to May 20, 2014 using the terms 'Crohn's disease', 'ulcerative colitis' and 'vitamin D'. Results: Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with IBD. Limited clinical data suggest an association between low vitamin D concentration and increased disease activity in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). To date, only two small open label trials and one randomized controlled trial have shown a positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on disease activity in patients with CD; no effect has been shown for UC. An optimal vitamin D supplementation protocol for patients with IBD remains undetermined, but targeting serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels between 30 and 50 ng/mL appears safe and may have benefits for IBD disease activity. Depending on baseline vitamin D serum concentration, ileal involvement in CD, body mass index, and perhaps smoking status, daily vitamin D doses between 1800-10,000 international units/day are probably necessary. CONCLUSION: Increasing preclinical and clinical evidence suggests a role for vitamin D deficiency in the development and severity of IBD. The possible therapeutic role of vitamin D in patients with IBD merits continued investigation.},

   abstract = {This study evaluated whether dietary resistant starch (RS) and green tea extract (GTE), which have anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties, protect against colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) using a rat model, also investigated potential mechanisms of action of these agents including their effects on the gut microbiota. Rats were fed a control diet or diets containing 10% RS, 0.5% GTE or a combination of the two (RS + GTE). CAC was initiated with 2 weekly azoxymethane (AOM) injections (10mg/kg) followed by 2% dextran sodium sulphate in drinking water for 7 days after 2 weeks on diets. Rats were killed 20 weeks after the first AOM. Colon tissues and tumours were examined for histopathology by H&E, gene/protein expression by PCR and immunohistochemistry and digesta for analyses of fermentation products and microbiota populations. RS and RS + GTE (but not GTE) diets significantly (P< 0.05) decreased tumour multiplicity and adenocarcinoma formation, relative to the control diet. Effects of RS + GTE were not different from RS alone. RS diet caused significant shifts in microbial composition/diversity, with increases in Parabacteroides, Barnesiella, Ruminococcus, Marvinbryantia and Bifidobacterium as primary contributors to the shift. RS-containing diets increased short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and expression of the SCFA receptor GPR43 mRNA, and reduced inflammation (COX-2, NF-kB, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA) and cell proliferation P< 0.05. GTE had no effect. This is the first study that demonstrates chemopreventive effects of RS (but not GTE) in a rodent CAC model, suggesting RS might have benefit to patients with ulcerative colitis who are at an increased risk of developing CRC.},

   abstract = {AIM: To explore the preventive and therapeutic effects of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) supernatant on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis in mice. METHODS: Forty C57BL/6J male mice were randomly divided into four groups: control group, model group, treatment group, and prevention group. Mice were weighed daily. On day 10, the colon length was measured, the colorectal histopathologic damage score (HDS) was assessed, and plasma interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-6, and IL-4 levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of transcription factor retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-gammat (RORgammat) and IL-17A in colon inflammatory mucosa tissue were determined by immunohistochemical assay, and the expression levels of RORgammat mRNA, IL-17A mRNA, and IL-6 mRNA were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The proportion of Th17 in mononuclear cells in spleen was assayed by fluorescence activated cell sorter. RESULTS: When compared with the model group, the colon length (P < 0.05) and body weight (P < 0.01) in the treatment and prevention groups were significantly increased, and the colon HDS was decreased (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). There was no statistical difference between the treatment group and prevention group. After treatment with F. prausnitzii supernatant, the plasma levels of IL-17A and IL-6 (P < 0.05), the protein and mRNA expression of IL-17A and RORgammat, and the Th17 cell ratio of spleen cells (P < 0.01) were significantly decreased compared to the model group. Plasma IL-4 level in the prevention group was significantly higher than that in the model group (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between these two groups in the expression of IL-6 in both the plasma and colon mucosa tissues. CONCLUSION: F. prausnitzii supernatant exerts protective and therapeutic effects on DSS-induced colitis in mice, probably via inhibition of Th17 differentiation and IL-17A secretion in the plasma and colon mucosa tissues. It can also improve colitis in mice by downregulating IL-6 and prevent colitis by upregulating IL-4.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In ulcerative colitis (UC), dietary supplements may have anti-inflammatory properties and improve disease course. We investigated the effects of casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP), a fraction of bovine whey protein, in active UC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a randomized open-label intervention study, 24 patients with active UC involving 10-40 cm of the distal colon were randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio into two groups. The first group was administered their usual treatment plus a daily supplement of CGMP 30 g, and the second group was administered a dose escalation to 4800 mg oral mesalamine daily (standard treatment) for 4 weeks. Clinical, endoscopic, mucosal and circulating disease activity markers were monitored. Acceptance of and adherence to CGMP up to 8 weeks were documented. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of treatment, 10 of 16 (63%) patients who received CGMP had an unchanged or decreased Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI), which was similar to the four of eight (50%) (P = 0.67) patients on the standard treatment. The number of patients in which SCCAI decreased by three or more did not differ between the two groups: nine of 16 (56%) in the CGMP group vs. four of eight (50%) in the standard treatment group (P = 0.77). Changes in disease extent and severity were similar between the two groups. CGMP was well tolerated and accepted by the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of CGMP as a nutritional therapy to standard treatment was safe and accepted by patients with active distal UC. The disease-modifying effect of CGMP was similar to that of the mesalamine dose escalation.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a consecutive sample of children with newly diagnosed IBD referring to Mofid Children's University Hospital in Tehran (Iran) between November 2013 and March 2015. Data on age, gender, history of cow's milk allergy (CMA), IBD type, routine laboratory tests, and colonoscopic and histopathological findings were gathered. Food allergy was assessed with the skin prick test (SPT). RESULTS: A total of 28 patients including 19 ulcerative colitis (UC), 7 Cronh's disease (CD), and two with unclassified colitis with a mean age of 8.3 +/- 4.4 years. (57.1% females, 42.9% were studied. History of CMA was present in eight patients (28.6%). Seventeen patients (60.7%) had at least one food allergy (68.4% of UC vs. 42.9% of CD, P = 0.230). Ten patients (35.7%) had multiple food allergies (36.8% of UC vs. 42.9% of CD, P > 0.999). Common allergic foods were cow's milk (28.6%), beef, seafood, albumen, wheat, and walnuts (each 10.7%), and peanuts and chestnuts (each 7.1%). The SPT showed CMA in 68.4% (8/17) of UC but none of the CD patients (P = 0.077). CONCLUSION: Food allergy is frequent in Iranian pediatric IBD patients with CMA being the most common observed allergy. The CMA seems to be more frequent in UC than in CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have an increasingly important role in the evaluation of new therapies for inflammatory bowel disease. The US Food and Drug Administration has issued formal guidance to describe the role of PRO instruments in evaluation of claims for product labelling. However, no validated PRO exists for ulcerative colitis. AIM: To investigate whether the PROs from the Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) for UC can be modified, to develop an interim PRO for use in clinical trials, alone or in combination with endoscopy. METHODS: Data from an induction trial of a mesalazine (mesalamine) formulation were used to compare effect sizes between mesalazine and placebo for PRO items (stool frequency and rectal bleeding) alone and in combination with endoscopy. The operating properties of the PRO were validated using data from a phase 2 trial of MLN02, a humanised antibody to the alpha4beta7 integrin in patients with UC. RESULTS: A two-item PRO (PRO2) consisting of rectal bleeding = 0 and stool frequency </=1 or </=2, combined with an endoscopy subscore </=1 yielded statistically significant differences between active drug and placebo. This combination yielded the most similar effect sizes and placebo rates for remission, compared to the primary trials. Use of PRO items alone yielded high placebo remission rates in both data sets, although rates were lower when the items were combined and remission defined as PRO2 = 0. CONCLUSION: Patient-reported outcomes items derived from the Mayo Clinic Score combined with endoscopy as a co-primary endpoint may be an appropriate interim outcome measure for ulcerative colitis trials.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Colonic fermentation in patients with UC in remission was compared with that in matched healthy subjects on habitual diets and when dietary fibre was increased. DESIGN: Fibre intake, faecal output of fibre (measured as non-starch polysaccharide (NSP)), starch, microbiota and fermentation products, and whole gut transit time (WGTT) were assessed in association with habitual diet and when dietary intake of wheat bran (WB)-associated fibre and high amylose-associated resistant starch (RS) was increased in an 8-week, randomised, single-blind, cross-over study. RESULTS: Despite a tendency to lower habitual fibre intake in UC patients, faecal NSP and starch concentrations were threefold higher than in controls, whereas concentrations of phenols and short-chain fatty acids, pH and WGTT were similar. Increasing RS/WB intake was well tolerated. In controls (n=10), it more than doubled faecal NSP and starch excretion (p=0.002 for both), had no effect on NSP usage and reduced WGTT (p=0.024). In UC patients (n=19), high intake of RS/WB tended to normalise gut transit, but did not increase the proportion of NSP fermented. Increasing intake of RS/WB had little effect on faecal fermentation patterns or the structure of the microbiota. However, faeces from the UC cohort had lower proportions of Akkermansia muciniphila and increased diversity within Clostridium cluster XIVa compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Gut fermentation of NSP and starch is diminished in patients with UC. This cannot be explained by abnormal gut transit and was not corrected by increasing RS/WB intake, and may be due to abnormal functioning of the gut microbiota.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly Crohn's disease (CD), is associated with increased microbial-specific IgG and IgA antibodies, whereas alterations of anti-food antibodies are still disputed. The knowledge about IgG subclass antibodies in IBD is limited. In this study we analysed IgG subclass antibodies specific for nutritional and commensal antigens in IBD patients and controls. METHODS: Serum IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 specific for wheat and milk extracts, purified ovalbumin, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis lysates and mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were analysed by ELISA in patients with CD (n = 56), ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 29), acute gastroenteritis/colitis (n = 12) as well as non-inflammatory controls (n = 62). RESULTS: Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) of all IgG subclasses and anti-B. fragilis IgG1 levels were increased in CD patients compared to UC patients and controls. The discriminant validity of ASCA IgG2 and IgG4 was comparable with that of ASCA pan-IgG and IgA, whereas it was inferior for ASCA IgG1/IgG3 and anti-B. fragilis IgG1. Complicated CD defined by the presence of perianal, stricturing or penetrating disease phenotypes was associated with increased ASCA IgG1/IgG3/IgG4, anti-B. fragilis IgG1 and anti-E. coli IgG1 levels. Anti-food IgG subclass levels were not different between IBD patients and controls and did not correlate with food intolerance. In contrast to anti-microbial Abs, food-specific IgG responses were predominately of the IgG4 isotype and all food-specific IgG subclass levels correlated negatively with age. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the notion that the adaptive immune recognition of food and commensal antigens are differentially regulated.},

Recent studies suggest that guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) expressed in the GI tract constitutes a novel pharmacological target in the treatment of FGID and IBD. Endogenous GC-C agonists - guanylin peptides: guanylin and uroguanylin, by the regulation of water and electrolyte transport, are involved in the maintenance of homeostasis in the intestines and integrity of the intestinal mucosa. Linaclotide, a synthetic agonist of GC-C was approved by Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency as a therapeutic in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). Lately, several preclinical and clinical trials focused on assessment of therapeutic properties of synthetic agonists of uroguanylin, plecanatide, and SP-333. Plecanatide is currently tested as a potential therapeutic in diseases related to constipation and SP-333 is a promising drug in ulcerative colitis treatment. PURPOSE: Here, we discuss the most recent findings and future trends on the development of GC-C agonists and their use in clinical trials.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology. It has been proposed that modifying the bacterial flora in intestine with probiotics may decrease the inflammatory process and prevent relapses in UC. We investigated the possible protective and therapeutic effects of a single strand of probiotic, Bifidobacterium infantis (BI), on colonic inflammation, in rats with regular feedings. Two groups of Lewis rats were prepared (n = 8). The first group was the control, sham-fed group (n = 4). The other group was the experimental BI-fed group (n = 4). Colitis was induced in both groups by intrarectal administration of TNBS under light anesthesia. The sham-fed colitis induced groups received a daily oral gavage feeding of 1.0 mL distilled water, whereas the B. infantis-fed group received 0.205 g of B. infantis dissolved in 1.0 mL distilled water daily. The change in body weight and food and water intake was recorded over the course of each study and analyzed. The rats were euthanized and tissues from the descending colon were harvested and analyzed microscopically and histologically. Results of our study indicated significant reduction in inflammation, mucosal damage, and preservation of goblet cells, as compared to the control animals. Modulation of gastrointestinal (GI) flora suggests a promising field in developing strategies for prevention and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases by dietary modifications.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of the Punica granatum peel extract on symptoms of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHOD: Patients with UC were randomized to receive an aqueous extract of the P. granatum peel (6 g of dry peel/day) or placebo for four weeks complementary to standard medications. Symptoms were assessed using the Lichtiger Colitis Activity Index (LCAI) at baseline, week 4, and week 10 (follow-up). Clinical response was defined by >/= 3 point decrease in LCAI. RESULTS: The LCAI score was similarly reduced in both the P. granatum (-1.68 +/- 3.85, P = 0.019) and placebo groups (-1.39 +/- 2.41, P = 0.002). Clinical response was higher with P. granatum compared with placebo at week 4 (41.4% vs. 18.2%, P = 0.055), but not at week 10 (48.3% vs. 36.4%, P = 0.441). CONCLUSIONS: The P. granatum peel extract seems effective in complementary management of UC. Further studies in a larger sample of patients are warranted. IRCT2014040617156N1.},

   abstract = {Goji berry (Lycium barbarum) exerts immune modulation and suppresses inflammation in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesized that Goji berry had beneficial effects on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice through suppressing inflammation. Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were supplemented with a standard AIN-93G diet with or without 1% (w/w) Goji berry for 4 weeks. Then, colitis was induced by supplementing 3% DSS in drinking water for 7 days, followed by 7 days of remission period to mimic ulcerative colitis symptoms. Goji berry supplementation ameliorated DSS-induced body weight loss, diminished diarrhea and gross bleeding, and resulted in a significantly decreased disease activity index, as well as DSS-associated colon shortening. Moreover, 30% mortality rate caused by DSS-induced colitis was avoided because of Goji berry supplementation. Histologically, Goji berry ameliorated colonic edema, mucosal damage and neutrophil infiltration into colonic intestinal tissue in response to DSS challenge, which was associated with decreased expression of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, as well as inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 and cyclooxygenase-2. In conclusion, Goji supplementation confers protective effects against DSS-induced colitis, which is associated with decreased neutrophil infiltration and suppressed inflammation. Thus, dietary Goji is likely beneficial to inflammatory bowel disease patients as a complementary therapeutic strategy.},

A healthy gut environment is regulated by the exquisite balance of intestinal microbiota, metabolites, and the host's immune system. Imbalance of these factors in genetically susceptible persons may promote a disease state. Manipulation of the intestinal microbiota with prebiotics, which can selectively stimulate growth of beneficial bacteria, might help to maintain a healthy intestinal environment or improve diseased one. In this review, analytical methods for identification of intestinal bacteria and an update on the correlation of the intestinal microbiota with human health and disease were discussed by introducing our recent studies to determine the prebiotic effects of a fiber-rich food in animal model and on healthy people and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC).},

   abstract = {The present study explains the effect of concomitant administration of synbiotics with the polysaccharide based colon targeted delivery system. As the gut microflora get deranged on administration of mesalamine, drug release from such delivery systems is expected to be jeopardised because the release trigger is dependent solely on the colonic microbiota. To overcome this limitation, mesalamine was formulated as microspheres with guar gum and xanthan gum (prebiotics). These were combined with probiotics containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longumand Saccharomyces boulardi. Dissolution studies of the prepared formulation conducted in simulated colonic fluid clearly demonstrated its superiority over the marketed, delayed release dosage forms of mesalamine. The therapeutic benefit of the concomitant administration of synbiotic with mesalamine was evidenced by the comparative evaluation of faecal contents, weight gain trend and histopathological studies conducted in rats. The results suggest that co-administration of synbiotics with mesalamine can be used as a convenient methodology to achieve efficient and cost-effective targeting of the drug to colon.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Crohn's disease (CD), the involvement of food antigens in immune responses remains unclear. The objective of this study was to detect immune responses against food antigens in CD patients and examine the mechanism in a mouse model of colitis. METHODS: We enrolled 98 CD patients, 50 ulcerative colitis patients, and 52 healthy controls (HCs) to compare the levels of serum immunoglobulin (Ig)Gs against 88 foods. The presence of serum IgGs against foods was also examined in interleukin (IL)-10 knockout (KO) mice in which CD4(+) T cell activation by antigenic food protein was assessed. Mice transferred with IL-10 KO cells received diets with or without food antigens, and the development of colitis was evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of IgGs against various foods, especially vegetables, grains, and nuts, was significantly higher in CD patients than in HCs. Similarly, the prevalence of IgGs against food proteins was higher in IL-10 KO mice than in BALB/c mice. Beta-conglycinin, identified as an antigenic food proteins in IL-10 KO mice, induced CD4(+) T cell production of interferon-gamma and IL-17 through dendritic cell antigen presentation. Elimination of the food antigens ameliorated the development of colitis in mice without altering the composition of their intestinal microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: In CD colitis mice, intestinal inflammation via CD4(+) T cell hyperactivation was induced by food antigens associated with high serum IgG levels and was ameliorated by the elimination of food antigens. This disrupted immunological tolerance to food antigen, which might act as an exacerbating factor, remains to be elucidated in CD patients.},

   abstract = {The gut is a unique tissue where a refined balance is maintained between immune responses and tolerance to a variety of foreign antigens including food and commensal bacteria. Although activation of T helper (Th) cells, such as Th1 and Th17 cells, is responsible for the host defense against invading pathogens in the gut, inappropriate Th1/Th17 responses cause onset and/or progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprised of two major disorders; ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Therefore, the inflammatory responses by Th1/Th17 cells in the gut are tightly regulated through a number of mechanisms. In the human intestine, several innate immune cell subsets play important roles in the maintenance of the gut homeostasis by controlling adaptive immune responses. We recently identified CD14+ CD163low cells and CD14+ CD163high CD160high cells as Th17-inducing dendritic cells and anti-inflammatory phagocytes, respectively. In addition, the dysfunction of these cell subsets was observed in the patients with IBD. Therefore, it would be an important future issue to analyze the mechanisms underlying regulation of intestinal innate immune cell homeostasis for the development of a novel therapeutic intervention for IBD.},

   abstract = {Saffron, the dried red-orange stigmas of Crocus sativus L, has been known as a flavoring agent, food coloring and traditional herbal medicine. Pharmacological effects of saffron are mainly attributed to crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin and safranal. These components especially crocin, have significant effects including antidepressant and anticonvulsant, analgesic, anti-cancer and other therapeutic effects on different parts of our body namely cardiovascular, immune, respiratory, genital-urinary and central nervous system. According to the reports and findings, saffron plays a key role to cure different digestive system disorders via chemopreventive, inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, antioxidant effects and radical scavenging, genoprotective property, prevention of lipid peroxidation and anti-inflammatory processes. The outcome of the above mentioned mechanisms shows potential therapeutic properties of saffron against liver cancer, hepatotoxicity, fatty liver, hyperlipidemia, stomach cancer, peptic ulcer, colon cancer, ulcerative colitis, diabetes and pancreas cancer and ileum contractions. According to global statistics, the susceptibility to intestinal diseases is considered as a significant matter and can be important in health planning in any community. Several strategies for treatment and prevention of the digestive system diseases have provided that the use of herbal remedies seems effective and useful. Considering the available findings, the present study aims to introduce saffron as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent against gastrointestinal tract disorders. However, further clinical studies seem necessary in various aspects of saffron effects in different parts of body to verify these findings.},

   abstract = {This study sought to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of mango (Mangifera Indica L.) polyphenolics containing gallic acid and gallotanins, and the role of the miR-126/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis in vitro and in vivo. Polyphenolics extracted from mango (var. Keitt) were investigated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated CCD-18Co cells. Rats received either a beverage with mango polyphenolics or a control beverage, and were exposed to three cycles of 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) followed by a 2-wk recovery period. The mango extract (10 mg GAE/L) suppressed the protein expression of NF-kappaB, p-NF-kappaB, PI3K (p85beta), HIF-1alpha, p70S6K1, and RPS6 in LPS-treated CCD-18Co cells. LPS reduced miR-126 expression, whereas, the mango extract induced miR-126 expression in a dose-dependent manner. The relationship between miR-126 and its target, PI3K (p85beta), was confirmed by treating cells with miR-126 antagomiR where mango polyphenols reversed the effects of the antagomiR. In vivo, mango beverage protected against DSS-induced colonic inflammation (47%, P = 0.05) and decreased the Ki-67 labeling index in the central and basal regions compared to the control. Mango beverage significantly attenuated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and iNOS at the mRNA and protein level. Moreover, the expression of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR was reduced, whereas, miR-126 was upregulated by the mango treatment. These results suggest that mango polyphenols attenuated inflammatory response by modulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at least in part through upregulation of miRNA-126 expression both in vitro and in vivo; thus, mango polyphenolics might be relevant as preventive agents in ulcerative colitis.

   abstract = {SCOPE: Tannin-rich fruits have been evaluated as alternative prevention strategies for colorectal cancer based on their anti-inflammatory properties. This study compared tannin-rich preparations from mango (rich in gallotannins) and pomegranate (rich in ellagitannins) in the dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis model. METHODS AND RESULTS: In rats, mango and pomegranate beverages decreased intestinal inflammation and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mucosa and serum. The mango beverage suppressed the ratio of phosphorylated/total protein expression of the IGF-1R-AKT/mTOR axis and downregulated mRNA expression of Igf1, Insr, and pik3cv. Pomegranate decreased p70S6K and RPS6, as well as Rps6ka2, Map2k2, and Mapk1 mRNA. In silico modeling indicated a high binding of docked of gallic acid to the catalytic domain of IGF-1R, which may suppress the activity of the enzyme. Ellagic acid docked effectively into the catalytic domains of both IGF-1R and EGFR. In vitro assays with lipopolysaccharide-treated CCD-18Co cells using polyphenolic extracts from each beverage, as well as pure compounds, corroborated the predictions made in silico. CONCLUSION: Mango polyphenols inhibited the IGF-1R- AKT/mTOR axis, and pomegranate polyphenols downregulate the mTOR downstream pathway through reductions in ERK1/2. These results suggest that extracts rich in gallo- and ellagitannins act on different molecular targets in the protection against ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, involves chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Previously, Sasa quelpaertensis leaves have been shown to mediate anti-inflammation and anti-cancer effects, although it remains unclear whether Sasa leaves are able to attenuate inflammation-related intestinal diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of Sasa quelpaertensis leaf extract (SQE) using an in vitro co-culture model of the intestinal epithelial environment. MATERIALS/METHODS: An in vitro co-culture system was established that consisted of intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce inflammation. RESULTS: Treatment with SQE significantly suppressed the secretion of LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-6, and IL-1beta in co-cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages. In addition, expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were down-regulated in response to inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation by SQE. Compared with two bioactive compounds that have previously been identified in SQE, tricin and P-coumaric acid, SQE exhibited the most effective anti-inflammatory properties. CONCLUSIONS: SQE exhibited intestinal anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting various inflammatory mediators mediated through nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-kB) activation. Thus, SQE has the potential to ameliorate inflammation-related diseases, including IBD, by limiting excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D substitution is recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Specific guidelines are lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation with respect to dosage and patient compliance. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 167 Crohn disease/ulcerative colitis outpatients. Patients were screened for serum vitamin D (25OHD2+3) at the end of summer and in late winter. Demographic data, history of vitamin D supplementation were recorded and matched with prescription records. RESULTS: A total of 57 subjects used vitamin D supplementation (mean dose 1104 IU/day). 25OHD2+3 levels were lower (p < 0.001) in winter both in substituted and unsubstituted group, without any differences between groups within the same season. 25OHD2+3 levels did not correlate with the substitution dose. 52.1 % of subjects were fully compliant with substitution. 25OHD2+3 and prevalence of vitamin D deficit in this group were comparable with unsubstituted subjects except a higher prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (p < 0.02). CONCLUSION: Fixed dosage of 1100 IU/day of vitamin D was insufficient to correct the deficiency. Patient compliance with vitamin D supplementation was low, however this fact did not significantly contribute to the degree of vitamin D deficiency in this dosage (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 21).},

   abstract = {The seeds of Phaseolus calcaratus Roxburgh (PHCR) are common legumes that comprise part of the daily diet in Chinese and Korean culture. Recent findings highlight anti-inflammatory and anti-septic potentials of catechin-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (CGP) isolated from PHCR seeds. We investigated the intestinal anti-inflammatory activity and associated mechanisms of CGP using a rat model of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Oral treatment with CGP (10mg/kg body weight) suppressed body weight loss and intestinal inflammatory damages in TNBS-induced colitic rats. This treatment reduced myeloperoxidase activity and malondialdehyde level, but increased glutathione level in the TNBS colitic rats. CGP treatment also inhibited the TNBS-mediated increases in nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 proteins or mRNA levels. This inhibition was accompanied by the increased mRNA levels of mucins MUC2 and MUC3. The CGP treatment prevented phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, IkappaB-alpha, and DNA-nuclear factor-kappaB binding, all of which were increased in the inflamed colons of TNBS-treated rats. Furthermore, oral administration with a crude PHCR butanol extract (100mg/kg body weight) which contains 1.5% of CGP showed intestinal anti-inflammatory potentials similar to that of CGP. Collectively, our current findings suggest that CGP or CGP-containing PHCR seeds may have favorable effects on intestinal inflammatory diseases.},

Vedolizumab, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in May 2014 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC and Crohn's disease, is a newly developed anti-integrin therapy. This review focuses on the preclinical development of vedolizumab and data from early trials, and details the results of the landmark trails that led to its approval in the USA with a specific focus on the management of UC. Additionally, data on safety and the current UC management protocols are also discussed.},

   abstract = {Midkine is a multifunctional cytokine and growth factor displaying proinflammatory and pro-tumorigenic activity. Its association with bowel diseases has not been fully elucidated. Our purpose was to delineate midkine expression pattern by RT-qPCR in inflamed/cancerous bowel (n=208) and whole blood (n=150) in colorectal cancer (CRC), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) and to evaluate midkine dynamics in early postoperative period following colorectal surgery. The expression of midkine was significantly up-regulated in stage III CRC and independently associated with lymph node metastasis. The expression of midkine in whole blood was up-regulated solely in N1 CRC. Midkine expression in cancer-free tissue (CRC) was also elevated and dependent on CRC advancement. In IBD, inflammation increased the bowel expression of midkine solely in UC, in a manner proportional to the disease clinical activity. Large and small bowel differed with respect to the expression of midkine in quiescent tissue (higher in small bowel) and to its correlation pattern with chemokines (in a large bowel) and angiogenic factors and cell cycle regulators (in a small bowel). Circulating midkine and its expression in whole blood dropped directly following colorectal surgery; however, the concentration of midkine in serum was restored on postoperative day three. Midkine is involved in bowel inflammation in UC and lymph node metastasis in CRC, rendering midkine an attractive target for their treatment. Owing to midkine elevation in early postoperative period and its overexpression in tumor-adjacent tissue, targeting midkine might be considered also as a prevention of CRC recurrence following curative tumor resection.},

   abstract = {Intestinal inflammation induced with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) is used to study acute or chronic ulcerative colitis in animal models. Decreased gut tissue anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 concentration and mRNA abundance are associated with the development of chronic bowel inflammation. Twelve piglets of 3 days old were fitted with an intragastric catheter and randomly allocated into control and DSS groups by administrating either sterile saline or 1.25 g of DSS/kg body weight (BW) in saline per day, respectively, for 10 days. Growth rate and food conversion efficiency were reduced (p<0.05) in the DSS piglets compared with the control group. Quantitative histopathological grading of inflammation in the jejunum and colon collectively showed that the DSS treatment resulted in 12 fold greater (p<0.05) inflammation severity scoring in the colon than in the jejunum, indicative of chronic ulcerative colitis in the colon. Upper gut permeability endpoint was 27.4 fold higher (p<0.05) in the DSS group compared with the control group. The DSS group had higher concentrations and mRNA abundances (p<0.05) of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the jejunal and colonic tissues compared with the control group. Colonic concentration and mRNA abundance of IL-10 were reduced (p<0.05), however, jejunal IL-10 mRNA abundance was increased (p<0.05) in the DSS group compared with the control group. In conclusion, administration of DSS at 1.25 g/kg BW for 10 days respectively induced acute inflammation in the jejunum and chronic inflammation and ulcerative colitis in the colon with substantially decreased colonic concentration and mRNA abundance of IL-10 in the young pigs, mimicking the IL-10 expression pattern in humans Associated with chronic bowel inflammation.},

METHODS: A computerized search of databases [Cochrane Library, Pubmed/Medline, PsychINFO, and Scopus] through March 2014 was performed. We screened the reference sections of original studies and systematic reviews in English language for CAM in IBD, CD and UC. Randomized controlled trials [RCT] and controlled trials [CT] were referred and assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: A total of: 26 RCT and 3 CT for herbal medicine, eg aloe-vera gel, andrographis paniculata, artemisia absinthium, barley foodstuff, boswellia serrata, cannabis, curcumin, evening primrose oil, Myrrhinil intest(R), plantago ovata, silymarin, sophora, tormentil, wheatgrass-juice and wormwood; 1 RCT for trichuris suis ovata; 7 RCT for mind/body interventions such as lifestyle modification, hypnotherapy, relaxation training and mindfulness; and 2 RCT in acupuncture; were found. Risk of bias was quite heterogeneous. Best evidence was found for herbal therapy, ie plantago ovata and curcumin in UC maintenance therapy, wormwood in CD, mind/body therapy and self-intervention in UC, and acupuncture in UC and CD. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary and alternative therapies might be effective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases; however, given the low number of trials and the heterogeneous methodological quality of trials, further in-depth research is necessary.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon with unclear pathogenesis. A dysbiotic intestinal microbiota is regarded as a key component in the disease process and there has been significant interest in developing new treatments which target the microbiota. AIM: To give an overview of the studies to date investigating prebiotics and synbiotics for the treatment of UC. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed and related search engines was carried out using the terms "ulcerative colitis" in combination with "prebiotic", "synbiotic" or "dietary fibre". RESULTS: In total 17 studies on humans examining the effect of prebiotics in UC were found. Five major groups could be distinguished. Fructo-oligosaccharides were tried in six studies (mean 35 patients included, range 9-121). One study found a clinical response while two demonstrated indirect evidence of an effect. Germinated barley foodstuff was used in 8 studies (mean 38 patients, range 10-63). One study found an endoscopic response, while four noted a clinical response and two some indirect effects. Galacto-oligosaccharides, lactulose and resveratrol were used in one study each (mean 48 patients, range 41-52). One study found an endoscopic response and one a clinical response. CONCLUSION: There is yet inadequate evidence - especially in humans - to support any particular prebiotic in the clinical management of UC. However, due to the bulk of evidence supporting the effect of the microbiota on colonic inflammation, there is enough potential to justify further high-quality clinical trials investigating this subject.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The relevance of spatial composition in the microbial changes associated with UC is unclear. We coupled luminal brush samples, mucosal biopsies and laser capture microdissection with deep sequencing of the gut microbiota to develop an integrated spatial assessment of the microbial community in controls and UC. DESIGN: A total of 98 samples were sequenced to a mean depth of 31,642 reads from nine individuals, four control volunteers undergoing routine colonoscopy and five patients undergoing surgical colectomy for medically-refractory UC. Samples were retrieved at four colorectal locations, incorporating the luminal microbiota, mucus gel layer and whole mucosal biopsies. RESULTS: Interpersonal variability accounted for approximately half of the total variance. Surprisingly, within individuals, asymmetric Eigenvector map analysis demonstrated differentiation between the luminal and mucus gel microbiota, in both controls and UC, with no differentiation between colorectal regions. At a taxonomic level, differentiation was evident between both cohorts, as well as between the luminal and mucosal compartments, with a small group of taxa uniquely discriminating the luminal and mucosal microbiota in colitis. There was no correlation between regional inflammation and a breakdown in this spatial differentiation or bacterial diversity. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a conserved spatial structure to the colonic microbiota, differentiating the luminal and mucosal communities, within the context of marked interpersonal variability. While elements of this structure overlap between UC and control volunteers, there are differences between the two groups, both in terms of the overall taxonomic composition and how spatial structure is ascribable to distinct taxa.},

   abstract = {The role of the food delivery matrix in probiotic performance in the intestine is not well understood. Because probiotics are often provided to consumers in dairy products, we investigated the contributions of milk to the health-benefiting performance of Lactobacillus casei BL23 in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine model of ulcerative colitis. L. casei BL23 protected against the development of colitis when ingested in milk but not in a nutrient-free buffer simulating consumption as a nutritional supplement. Consumption of (acidified) milk alone also provided some protection against weight loss and intestinal inflammation but was not as effective as L. casei and milk in combination. In contrast, L. casei mutants deficient in DltD (lipoteichoic acid d-alanine transfer protein) or RecA (recombinase A) were unable to protect against DSS-induced colitis, even when consumed in the presence of milk. Mice fed either L. casei or milk contained reduced quantities of colonic proinflammatory cytokines, indicating that the L. casei DltD(-) and RecA(-) mutants as well as L. casei BL23 in nutrient-free buffer were effective at modulating immune responses. However, there was not a direct correlation between colitis and quantities of these cytokines at the time of sacrifice. Identification of the cecal microbiota by 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that L. casei in milk enriched for Comamonadaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae; however, the consumption of neither L. casei nor milk resulted in the restoration of the microbiota to resemble that of healthy animals. These findings strongly indicate that probiotic strain efficacy can be influenced by the food/supplement delivery matrix.},

   abstract = {Some of the most common symptoms of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, which include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. It is therefore not surprising that clinicians and patients have wondered whether dietary patterns influence the onset or course of IBD. The question of what to eat is among the most commonly asked by patients, and among the most difficult to answer for clinicians. There are substantial variations in dietary behaviors of patients and recommendations for them, although clinicians do not routinely endorse specific diets for patients with IBD. Dietary clinical trials have been limited by their inability to include a placebo control, contamination of study groups, and inclusion of patients receiving medical therapies. Additional challenges include accuracy of information on dietary intake, complex interactions between foods consumed, and differences in food metabolism among individuals. We review the roles of diet in the etiology and management of IBD based on plausible mechanisms and clinical evidence. Researchers have learned much about the effects of diet on the mucosal immune system, epithelial function, and the intestinal microbiome; these findings could have significant practical implications. Controlled studies of patients receiving enteral nutrition and observations made from patients on exclusion diets have shown that components of whole foods can have deleterious effects for patients with IBD. Additionally, studies in animal models suggested that certain nutrients can reduce intestinal inflammation. In the future, engineered diets that restrict deleterious components but supplement beneficial nutrients could be used to modify the luminal intestinal environment of patients with IBD; these might be used alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents, or as salvage therapy for patients who do not respond or lose responsiveness to medical therapies. Stricter diets might be required to induce remission, and more sustainable exclusion diets could be used to maintain long-term remission.},

   abstract = {It is important to have clear goals for treating inflammatory bowel disease in clinical practice and in research. Conventional end points for trials in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have been based on composite indices, such as the Mayo Clinic Score and the Crohn's Disease Activity Index; these indices incorporate symptoms, signs, and findings from laboratory tests and sometimes endoscopic assessments. Although definitions of clinical response and remission have been based on these indices for regulatory purposes, they are difficult to apply to practice because they are complex and not intuitive to clinicians. This has caused a disconnect between clinical trials and practice. Recently, the use of composite indices in trials has been reevaluated in Food and Drug Administration-sponsored Gastroenterology Regulatory Endpoints and the Advancement of Therapeutics workshops due to concerns about the validity of the indices. Alternative measures of outcome and definitions of response are being developed. Patient-reported outcomes are psychometric instruments created and defined by patients to quantify symptoms. A combination of end points, comprising patient-reported outcomes and objective evaluation of inflammation by endoscopy, offers a clinically meaningful and scientifically valid alternative to existing composite indices. Unlike composite indices, response definitions based on endoscopy and patient-reported outcomes can be readily applied in practice. This convergence of outcome assessment in clinical trials and practice could expedite implementation of "treat-to-target" algorithms, in which therapy is progressively intensified until a specific treatment goal is reached. This approach could improve patient care by reducing rates of disease-related complications, surgery, and hospitalization.},

   abstract = {To date, associations between consumption of vegetables and fruit and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease have been a controversial subject. Therefore, we carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate the associations. A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure to identify all relevant studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from random-effects or fixed-effects models were calculated. Publication bias was estimated using Egger's test and the funnel plot. A total of 14 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. On the basis of the highest versus the lowest analysis, consumption of vegetables was associated inversely with the risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) (OR=0.71, 95% CI 0.58-0.88, n=9 studies), but not with Crohn's disease (CD) (OR=0.66, 95% CI 0.40-1.09, n=8 studies). Higher consumption of fruit was associated inversely with the risk of UC (OR=0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.96, n=8 studies) and CD (OR=0.57, 95% CI 0.44-0.74, n=10 studies). For intake of vegetables and the risk of CD, subgroup analysis showed a significant association for studies carried out in Europe (OR=0.36, 95% CI 0.23-0.57), but not in Asia (OR=1.00, 95% CI 0.50-2.03). No significant publication bias was found for the analysis of intake of vegetables and the risk of UC, intake of fruit and the risk of UC, and intake of vegetables and the risk of CD. This meta-analysis indicates that consumption of vegetables and fruit might be associated inversely with the risk of UC and CD, and the results need to be further confirmed.},

   abstract = {Our previous study demonstrated that a combination of alternative medicine berberine and conventional 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) showed promise to be a novel therapeutic strategy for ulcerative colitis (UC). This present study aims to sketch the pre-clinical toxicity profile of this combination (1:10 dose ratio) on mice. In acute toxicity test, the determined median lethal dose (LD50) was 278.7 mg/kg berberine plus 2787 mg/kg 5-ASA. The results from subacute toxicity test demonstrated that no toxic signs of clinical symptoms, no significant changes in hematological or biochemical parameters were detected in mice treated with 14 + 140, 28 + 280 or 56 + 560 mg/kg of berberine plus 5-ASA treatment. Histological examinations revealed that accompanied with an increase in spleen weight, frequently recorded enlargement and white pulp hyperplasia of spleen were detected in mice when exposed to three doses of combination treatments. Further in vitro assessment suggested that the spleen toxicity was originated from berberine by its inhibition in cell viability and cell proliferation of lymphocytes. The results of this study indicate that the combination of berberine and 5-ASA shows a slight toxic effect on spleen, suggesting that this combination should be used with caution for patients.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition associated with rectal bleeding and urgency, tenesmus, and diarrhea. Several medical therapies can be used in the treatment of UC. Aminosalicylates are widely used based on their efficacy in the induction and maintenance of remission. Although corticosteroids are effective in patients with more severe disease, systemic use is associated with significant safety concerns. The newer corticosteroid budesonide has lower systemic bioavailability and, consequently, a more favorable safety profile. A budesonide extended-release formulation allows once-daily dosing and delivers the agent locally throughout the colon. Biologic agents used for the treatment of moderate to severe UC include the tumor necrosis factor inhibitors infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab, and the integrin inhibitor vedolizumab. Rectally administered therapy can also be useful in the treatment of UC. In October 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a budesonide foam formulation for inducing remission in patients with active mild to moderate distal UC extending up to 40 cm from the anal verge. Budesonide foam rapidly distributes to the sigmoid colon and the rectum and avoids some of the drawbacks of suppositories and enemas.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Vedolizumab was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]. No study to date has examined the rate of postoperative infectious complications among patients who received vedolizumab in the perioperative period. We sought to determine the 30-day postoperative infectious complication rate among inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] patients who received vedolizumab within 12 weeks of an abdominal operation as compared to patients who received tumour necrosis factor alpha [TNFalpha] inhibitors or no biological therapy. METHODS: A retrospective chart review between May 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015 of adult IBD patients who underwent an abdominal operation was performed. The study cohort comprised patients who received vedolizumab within 12 weeks of their abdominal operation and the control cohorts were patients who received TNFalpha inhibitors or no biological therapy. RESULTS: In total, 94 patients received vedolizumab within 12 weeks of an abdominal operation. Fifty experienced postoperative complications [53%], 35 of which were surgical site infections [SSIs] [36%]. The vedolizumab group experienced significantly higher rates of any postoperative infection [53% vs 33% anti-TNF and 28% non-biologics; p<0.001] and SSI [37% vs 10% and 13%; p<0.001]. On univariate and multivariate analysis, exposure to vedolizumab remained a significant predictor of postoperative SSI [p<0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-seven per cent of IBD patients who received vedolizumab within 30 days of a major abdominal operation experienced a 30-day postoperative SSI, significantly higher than patients receiving TNFalpha inhibitors or no biological therapy. Vedolizumab within 12 weeks of surgery remained the only predictor of 30-day postoperative SSI on multivariate analysis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An epidemiological association implicating diet in IBD risk or protection is widely accepted. Patients with IBD often make links to diet, but there is a dearth of literature exploring dietary perceptions and practices in this population. Our objective was to evaluate dietary beliefs and behaviors in IBD patients. METHODS: We developed a questionnaire assessing demographics, dietary beliefs and habits in IBD patients. This was prospectively administered to 400 consecutive patients attending our IBD clinics. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 48.4 years; 55% were female, 88% white, 39% had Crohn's disease and 51% had ulcerative colitis. Around 48% felt that diet could be the initiating factor in IBD and 57% felt it could trigger a flare. Worsening symptoms with certain foods was reported by 60%. About 66% deprived themselves of their favorite foods in order to prevent relapse. Three-fourth of patients believed that IBD affects appetite, more so during a relapse. Nearly half had never received any formal dietary advice, and two-thirds requested for further dietary advice. After adjusting for other predictors, the IBD subtype and ethnicity of the patients remained as significant factors for influencing beliefs held by patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that patients hold beliefs pertaining to the role of diet in IBD, with a high level of consistency around key perceived triggers. Whether all the symptoms reported are due to active inflammation cannot be ascertained, but the potential exists for dietary components triggering active disease and perpetuating gut injury, impacting on quality of life and health care costs.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis is a major inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), characterized by inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract through chronic or relapsing immune system activation. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential protective effect of oat beta-glucan (betaG) against colitis induced by DSS in mice. Eighty mice were randomly divided into the control group (no DSS, no betaG), DSS group (DSS only), DSS + L-betaG group (DSS plus 500 mg per kg betaG), and DSS + H-betaG group (DSS plus 1000 mg per kg betaG). Compared with the DSS group, administration of betaG significantly reduced clinical symptoms with less weight loss, diarrhea and shortening of the colon, the severity of colitis was significantly inhibited as evidenced by the reduced disease activity index (DAI) and degree of histological damage in colon. Moreover, treatment with betaG not only decreased myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), and nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, but also inhibited mRNA and protein expression of pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and iNOS. This suggests that oat betaG in diet might exhibit an anti-inflammatory function against colitis through inhibition of expression of pro-inflammatory factors.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Association of Signal transducers and activators of transcription-4 (STAT4) gene polymorphism with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease have been investigated in a number of epidemiological studies, but the results are inclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to more precisely estimate the relationship. METHODS: The databases of Pubmed and CBM updated to October, 2014 were retrieved. Random- or fixed-effect model was used to estimate odd radio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) on the basis of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Seven articles containing 2196 Crohn's disease (CD) cases, 1588 ulcerative colitis (UC) cases and 4126 controls were identified. We detected a significant association between STAT4 rs7574865 polymorphism and IBD susceptibility in overall population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.855, 95% CI=0.760-0.962, P=0.009), but not in Caucasian and Asian population, respectively. No association was detected between rs7574865 polymorphism and CD susceptibility in overall, Asian and Caucasian population, respectively. Interestingly, a significant association was detected between rs7574865 with UC susceptibility in overall population (G vs. T, OR=0.881, 95% CI=0.798-0.972, P=0.012; GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.788, 95% CI=0.679-0.914, P=0.002; GG vs. TT, OR=0.683, 95% CI=0.498-0.937, P=0.018) and Caucasians (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.833, 95% CI=0.701-0.990, P=0.038; GG+GT vs. TT, OR=0.667, 95% CI=0.456-0.975, P=0.037; GG vs. TT, OR=0.636, 95% CI=0.433-0.934, P=0.021), respectively, and a possible association was found in Asian population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.709, 95% CI=0.503-0.998, P=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: STAT4 rs7574865 gene is IBD risk factor, and this gene polymorphism is associated with UC susceptibility, especially in Caucasians. To confirm these findings, further studies with more sample size are required for a definitive conclusion.},

   abstract = {The purpose of the study was to assess the effects and the protective mechanism of konjac oligosaccharide (KOS) on the ulcerative colitis (UC) model induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) in rats. KOS (1.0 and 4.0g/kg/day) was administered for 14days after the induction of colitis with TNBS. The status of the rats was assessed by morphological and biochemical methods. The effect of KOS on the colonic microflora was also assessed by studying the bacteria profile and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production in feces by standard culture techniques and gas chromatography, respectively. KOS administration improved rat weight, colonic length, damage score, structure of gut microbiota, production of SCFA, and reduced colon tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Therefore, our results indicate that KOS is an anti-inflammatory and could be useful as a prebiotic to design functional foods for UC.},

   abstract = {Several epidemiological investigations have been conducted to evaluate the relationship between dietary fiber intake and inflammatory bowel diseases, but the results are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively summarize the evidence from observational studies. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Knowledge were searched for relevant articles published up to November 2014. The combined relative risks were calculated with the fixed- or random-effects model. Dose-response relationship was assessed using restricted cubic spline model. We hypothesized that the meta-analysis could yield a summary effect, which would indicate that dietary fiber intake could decrease the risk of ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease (CD). Overall, 8 articles involving 2 cohort studies, 1 nested case-control study, and 5 case-control studies were finally included in this study. The pooled relative risks with 95% confidence intervals of ulcerative colitis and CD for the highest vs lowest categories of dietary fiber intake were 0.80 (0.64-1.00) and 0.44 (0.29-0.69), respectively. A linear dose-response relationship was found between dietary fiber and CD risk, and the risk of CD decreased by 13% (P < .05) for every 10 g/d increment in fiber intake. The results from this meta-analysis indicated that the intake of dietary fiber was significantly associated with a decreased risk of inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) has been recommended as a therapeutic tool for ulcerative colitis (UC) treatment. However, to date, no meta-analysis has been performed on this topic. METHODS: We performed a literature search on PubMed, MEDLINE, Science Direct and EMBASE. We evaluated success rates for induction of remission, relapse rates and side effects, expressed as Intention-To-Treat. Odd ratios (OR), pooled OR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, based on the Mantel-Haenszel method. Heterogeneity was assessed by using the chi2 and I2 statistics and, if present, a random-effects model was adopted. RESULTS: We selected six eligible trials, with 719 patients, 390 assigned to the study group and 329 to the control group. EcN induced remission in 61.6% of cases, while in the control group (mesalazine) the remission was achieved in 69.5% of cases, with a mean difference of 7.9%. The pooled OR was 0.92 (95% CI 0.15-9.66, p=0.93). A single study showed a better performance of EcN than the placebo. A relapse of the disease occurred in 36.8% in the EcN group and in 36.1% in the control group (mesalazine), with a mean difference of 0.8%, OR=1.07, with a 95% CI of 0.70-1.64 (p=0.74). Side effects were comparable (OR=1.44, 95% CI 0.80-2.59, p=0.22). CONCLUSIONS: EcN is equivalent to mesalazine in preventing disease relapse, thus confirming current guideline recommendations. EcN seems to be as effective as controls in inducing remission and therefore, its use cannot be recommended as in one study the comparison was performed against placebo. Further studies may be helpful for this subject.},

Living in an underdeveloped area of China, residents in southwestern region have diverse dietary habits. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of food intolerance in the UC patients in this area and to discuss some of the possible risk factors leading to the condition. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Food antibodies in serum of 80 patients with active UC were determined by standard enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). This study examined the risk factors contributing to high titers of food antibodies and the dietary patterns correlating with food intolerance in these demographics. RESULTS: 83.8% of patients (67/80) were found to be seropositive for food intolerance. Patients of female, aged between 20 to 40 and the one who tended to have a high fat diet were tested to be highly seropositive (p<0.05). Neither spicy food intake nor the course the disease manifested any relationship with the presence of food intolerance (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Active UC patients in southwestern region of China have showed to be high seropositive in food intolerance, particularly in female and young patients. Dietary patterns with high in fat intake seem to have caused high prevalence of seropositivity in food intolerance. Although rice has been taken as staple food and the spicy food has been popular among citizen in this region, these foods have indicated to no effect on food intolerance in this study.},

Areas covered: This review focuses on the rationale of use, efficacy, and safety profile of all biologics currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, including tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (Infliximab and biosimilars, adalimumab, and golimumab), and the more recent vedolizumab. Expert opinion: Although biologics have been available in clinical practice for ulcerative colitis for about 15 years, there are several aspects that have not been fully understood yet: we know that they work, but we still don't know which subsets of patients benefit more, and how to optimize their use. All these unresolved problems are at least partly due to the discrepancy observed between phase II/III clinical trials of all biologics currently used in ulcerative colitis and in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the surgical treatment of choice for patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis. Postsurgery, functional and inflammatory complications of the ileal pouch often occur. Our previous study demonstrated that irritable pouch syndrome (IPS) is associated with the use of antidepressants or anxiolytics, suggesting an influence of psychological factors on patients' symptoms. The aim of this study was to identify the specific psychological factors and coping strategies in patients with functional (IPS) and inflammatory (pouchitis, cuffitis, Crohn's disease of the pouch) pouch disorders. METHODS: Consecutive patients with functional pouch disorders (IPS), inflammatory pouch conditions, and asymptomatic ileal pouch-anal anastomosis patients were surveyed using validated measures of quality of life (the Cleveland Global Quality of Life [CGQL] and Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Quality of Life [IBS-QOL]), daily functional impairment (WSAS), coping mechanisms (brief COPE) and anxiety/depression (DASS-21). RESULTS: Of 243 patients surveyed, 157 (64.6%) completed the surveys, of whom 137 (56.4%) met inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Sixty-one percent of respondents had pouch inflammation (pouchitis, N = 35; cuffitis, N = 14; and Crohn's disease of the pouch, N = 35), 20% had IPS (N = 27) and 19% (N = 26) had asymptomatic normal pouches. The age of participants ranged from 20 to 79 years with the mean ages of patients with normal pouches, IPS and inflammatory pouch conditions being 51.7 +/- 12.5, 47.1 +/- 15.0, 47.2 +/- 15.1 years, respectively. Patients with IPS were more likely to be taking antidepressants, anxiolytics, or narcotics than the other groups (P < 0.04). Patients with IPS or inflammatory pouches had significantly poorer quality of life (CGQL, P < 0.001; IBS-QOL, P < 0.003) than those with asymptomatic pouches, with differences particularly in the areas of food avoidance, activity interference, and sexual difficulties. Those with IPS (median = 11; interquartile range [IQR]: 3-19) or inflammatory pouch conditions (median = 7; IQR: 3-18) had a greater impairment in the domains of daily functioning related to the pouch condition than those with normal pouches (median = 1.5; IQR: 0-6; P = 0.003). The mean depression symptom scores were significantly higher in the IPS group than in the normal pouch group (11.7 +/- 9.7 versus 4.4 +/- 6.2; P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: IPS patients were more likely to have depressive symptoms and had a greater amount of impairment in daily functioning related to their pouch condition. Additionally, patients with functional pouch disorders are more likely to be concurrently treated with antidepressants, anxiolytic or narcotic agents than those with inflammatory pouches or normal pouches.},

In the present life and food style, inflammatory bowel disease has become common and needs a lead compound for its drug development. AIM: To evaluate the effect of Agave americana Linn. leaf extract in acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in rats based on its traditional anti-inflammatory use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were pretreated with A. americana leaf extract in the dose of 200 and 400 mg/kg p.o. daily for 7 days. On 8(th) day, 2 ml of 4% v/v acetic acid in saline was instilled into rats' rectum. Prednisolone was used as standard drug and it was administered on the day of acetic acid instillation and continued for 3 days. Extract treatment was continued till 11(th) day. Body weight, ulcer score, colonic muscle contraction, antioxidant activity and histopathology were studied. Statistical analysis was performed using Parametric one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's posttest. RESULTS: A. americana have retained total body weight significantly (P < 0.01) and decreased colon weight/length ratio. Extract have shown a significant decrease (P < 0.001) in ulcer scores, myeloperoxidase, lipid peroxidase activity. Further, extract have shown significant improvement in colonic muscle contraction, histopathology of colon etc., which is comparable with standard drug. CONCLUSION: A. americana possess protective effect against acetic acid-induced colitis in rats.},

To a large extent, this has been due to new 'omic' technologies that have facilitated large-scale analysis of the genetic and metabolic profile of this microbial community, revealing it to be comparable in influence to a new organ in the body and offering the possibility of a new route for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, it might be more accurate to think of it like an immune system: a collection of cells that work in unison with the host and that can promote health but sometimes initiate disease. This review gives an update on the current knowledge in the area of gut disorders, in particular metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disease, liver disease, IBD and colorectal cancer. The potential of manipulating the gut microbiota in these disorders is assessed, with an examination of the latest and most relevant evidence relating to antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols and faecal microbiota transplantation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Both science and patients associate diet with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. There is no doubt that links between IBD and diet are numerous, based on both epidemiological studies and experimental studies. However, scientific evidence to support dietary advice is currently lacking, and dietary counselling for IBD patients is often limited in clinical practice to the improvement of nutrient intake. This review aimed to focus on both patient's beliefs about and molecular mechanisms for crosstalk between nutrients and inflammation. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed was performed to identify relevant studies on diet and/or nutrients and their role in IBD. Pubmed [from inception to January 20, 2016] was searched using the terms: 'Crohn', 'colitis',' intestinal epithelial cells', and a list of terms relating to diet or numerous specific nutrients. Terms associated with nutrients were individually tested in the context of IBD. Reference lists from studies selected were manually searched to identify further relevant reports. Manuscripts about diet in the context of IBD from basic science, epidemiological studies, or clinical trials were selected and reviewed. Only articles published in English were included. RESULTS: Epidemiological studies highlight the key role of diet in IBD development, and many IBD patients report diet as a triggering factor in relapse of disease. In addition, we present research on the impact of nutrients on innate immunity. CONCLUSION: Diet may offer an alternative approach to restoring deficient innate immunity in IBD, and this may be the scientific rationale for providing dietary counselling for IBD patients.},

Many dietary polyphenols have been utilized for prevention of colitis in rodent models. Berries, green tea polyphenols, curcumin, and stilbenes have been the most extensively tested polyphenols in rodent models of colitis. The majority of polyphenols tested have inhibited colitis in rodents, but increasing doses of EGCG and green tea, isoflavones, flaxseed, and alpha-mangostin have exacerbated colitis. Few studies have examined combination of polyphenols or other bioactives for inhibition of colitis. Translating polyphenol doses used in rodent models of colitis to human equivalent doses reveals that supplemental doses are most likely required to inhibit colitis from a single polyphenol treatment. The ability to translate polyphenol treatments in rodent models is likely to be limited by species differences in xenobiotic metabolism and microbiota. Given these limitations, data from polyphenols in rodent models suggests merit for pursuing additional clinical studies for prevention of colitis.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The causes of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are largely unknown. This paper reviews the epidemiological and clinical data on how medications (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogens and antibiotics), lifestyle factors (smoking, psychological stress, diet and air pollution) may precipitate clinical relapses and recurrence. Potential biological mechanisms include: increasing thrombotic tendency, imbalances in prostaglandin synthesis, alterations in the composition of gut microbiota, and mucosal damage causing increased permeability. RESULTS: The clinical epidemiological data consistently reports positive associations between smoking and relapses in CD, and inverse ones with UC. For NSAIDs and estrogens, the epidemiological findings are inconsistent, although general antibiotic use was associated with a reduced risk of relapse in CD. High levels of stress were positively associated with relapse, although psychological interventions did not have therapeutic benefits. The limited work on diet has reported sulphur-containing foods are positively associated with relapse in UC, but there is no work in CD. Ecological data reported positive correlations between air pollution levels and IBD hospitalisations. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, to clarify this area, more clinical epidemiological work is required where detailed drug types and doses, and complete dietary intakes are measured, in specific forms of IBD. Such work could provide guidance to both patients and doctors to help maintain remission.},

   abstract = {Probiotics and prebiotics, mainly commercialised as food ingredients and also as supplements, are considered highly profitable niche markets. However, in recent years, the food industry has suffered from a series of health claim restrictions on probiotics and prebiotics in many parts of the world, including those made by the European Food Safety Authority. Therefore, we reviewed the core benefits of probiotic and prebiotic consumption on health. A number of studies have examined the prevention and/or management of intestinal infections, respiratory tract infections, CVD, osteoporosis, urogenital infections, cavities, periodontal disease and halitosis, allergic reactions, inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori gastric infections. In fact, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in human microbiota and immune system modulation by probiotics and prebiotics relies on continuous efforts to establish suitable biomarkers of health and diseases risk factors for the design of clinical trials required for health claim approval. In spite of the promising results, the performance of large, long-term, well-planned, well-aligned clinical studies is crucial to provide more reliability and a more solid basis for the outcomes achieved and to support the potential use of probiotics and prebiotics in clinical practice.},

Examination and pathological analysis of pigs (n=3) with diarrhoea was conducted and revealed the presence of Entamoeba organisms. We performed a genetic analysis of the isolate using the small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene region to identify the species. A severe ulcerative colitis was observed histopathologically with inflammatory cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, infiltrating the mucous membranes of the cecum and colon. Many Entamoeba trophozoites were found at the erosion site or at ulcerative lesions. Pathogenic viruses or bacteria were not detected. The SSU rRNA sequence of the Entamoeba isolate was found to be completely homologous to that of E. polecki subtype 3.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Anti-integrin therapy for the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease is rapidly evolving. Two agents, natalizumab and vedolizumab, are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Crohn's disease, with vedolizumab the primary anti-integrin used due to a more favorable safety profile. Several other anti-integrins are in various stages of development. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the current state of anti-integrin therapy as well as suggestions for positioning of these agents in clinical practice. Emerging anti-integrin therapies, their underlying mechanisms of action, and available safety and clinical data are also reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Anti-integrins are effective for the treatment of Crohn's disease, even in patients refractory to other therapies. Their use should be considered in patients with Crohn's disease who do not respond to, develop non-response to, or have contraindications to anti-TNF therapy. Anti-integrin therapies can be offered as a first biologic therapy, in particular for older patients, patients with concurrent multiple sclerosis (natalizumab only), and in patients with contraindications to anti-TNF therapy. In patients with more severe symptoms, providers should consider co-induction with corticosteroids if possible to hasten remission.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis is associated with a considerable reduction in the quality of life of patients. The use of phyto-ingredients is becoming an increasingly attractive approach for the management of colitis. Geraniol is a monoterpene with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of geraniol as a complementary and alternative medicine against dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis in mice. Disease activity indices (DAI) comprising body weight loss, presence of occult blood and stool consistency were assessed for evaluation of colitis symptoms. Intestinal damage was assessed by evaluating colon length and its histology. Pre-treatment with geraniol significantly reduced the DAI score, improved stool consistency (without occult blood) and increased the colon length. The amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines, specifically TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 and the activity of myeloperoxidase in colon tissue were significantly decreased in geraniol pre-treated mice. Western blot analyses revealed that geraniol interfered with NF-kappaB signaling by inhibiting NF-kappaB (p65)-DNA binding, and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, degradation and subsequent increase in nuclear translocation. Moreover, the expressions of downstream target pro-inflammatory enzymes such as iNOS and COX-2 were significantly reduced by geraniol. Pre-treatment with geraniol also restored the DSS-induced decline in antioxidant parameters such as reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase activity and attenuated the increase in lipid peroxidation marker, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and nitrative stress marker, nitrites in colon tissue. Thus, our results suggest that geraniol is a potential therapeutic agent for inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic intestinal illness of autoimmune origin affecting millions across the globe. The most common subtypes include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease. While many medical treatments for IBD exist, none come without the risk of significant immunosuppression and in general do not have benign side effect profiles. Surgical intervention exists only as radical resection for medically refractory UC. There exists a dire need for novel treatments that target the inherent pathophysiologic disturbances of IBD, rather than global immune suppression. One avenue of investigation that could provide such an agent is the interaction between certain dietary elements and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). The AHR is a cytosolic transcription factor with a rich history in environmental toxicant handling, however, recently a role has emerged for the AHR as a modulator of the gastrointestinal immune system. Studies have come to elucidate these effects to include the enhancement of Th cell subset differentiation, interactions between enteric flora and the luminal wall, and modulation of inflammatory interleukin and cytokine signaling. This review highlights advancements in our understanding of AHR activity in the digestive tract and how this stimulation may be wrought by certain dietary "micronutriceuticals", namely indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and its derivatives. Greater clarity surrounding these dynamics could lead to a novel diet-derived agonist of the AHR which is not only non-toxic, but also efficacious in the amelioration of clinical IBD.},

However, they may also have a pathogenic potential, and the role of Lactobacillus spp. as opportunistic pathogens, mostly following disruption of the intestinal mucosa, is emerging. CASE REPORT: We report on a case of bacteremia caused by L. rhamnosus GG in an adult patient affected by severe active ulcerative colitis under treatment with corticosteroids and mesalazine. Lactobacillus bacteremia was associated with candidemia and occurred while the patient was receiving a probiotic formulation containing the same strain (as determined by PFGE typing), and was being concomitantly treated with i.v. vancomycin, to which the Lactobacillus strain was resistant. L. rhamnosus GG bacteremia, therefore, was apparently related with translocation of bacteria from the intestinal lumen to the blood. CONCLUSIONS: Pending conclusive evidence, use of probiotics should be considered with caution in case of active severe inflammatory bowel diseases with mucosal disruption.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is multifactorial with data suggesting the role of a disturbed interaction between the gut and the intestinal microbiota. A defective mucosal barrier may result in increased intestinal permeability which promotes the exposition to luminal content and triggers an immunological response that promotes intestinal inflammation. IBD patients display several defects in the many specialized components of mucosal barrier, from the mucus layer composition to the adhesion molecules that regulate paracellular permeability. These alterations may represent a primary dysfunction in Crohn's disease, but they may also perpetuate chronic mucosal inflammation in ulcerative colitis. In clinical practice, several studies have documented that changes in intestinal permeability can predict IBD course. Functional tests, such as the sugar absorption tests or the novel imaging technique using confocal laser endomicroscopy, allow an in vivo assessment of gut barrier integrity. Antitumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) therapy reduces mucosal inflammation and restores intestinal permeability in IBD patients. Butyrate, zinc, and some probiotics also ameliorate mucosal barrier dysfunction but their use is still limited and further studies are needed before considering permeability manipulation as a therapeutic target in IBD.},

   abstract = {Keratins (K) are intermediate filament proteins important in protection from cellular stress. K8, K18 and K19 are the main components of keratin filaments in colonic epithelia but their role in intestinal diseases remains ambiguous. A function for keratins in intestinal health is supported by the K8-knock-out (K8(-/-)) mouse which manifests an early chronic ulcerative colitis-like inflammatory bowel disease and epithelial hyperproliferation. We tested whether K8(-/-) mice are more susceptible to colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to K8 wild type (K8(+/+)), and K8 heterozygote (K8(+/-)) mice showing increased proliferation but no inflammation. K8(-/-) mice did not develop CRC spontaneously, but had dramatically increased numbers of tumors in the distal colon in the azoxymethane (AOM) and Apc(Min/+) CRC models while neither K8(+/+) nor K8(+/-) mice were susceptible. Upregulation of IL-22 in combination with a complete loss of its negative regulator IL-22BP, and increased downstream STAT3-signaling in K8(-/-) and K8(-/-)Apc(Min/+) colonic epithelia confirmed that the IL-22 pathway, important in inflammation, proliferation and tissue regeneration, was activated. The nearly total loss of IL-22BP correlated with an activated inflammasome leading to increased cleaved caspase-1, and the putative IL-22BP inhibitor, IL-18, as well as a decrease in ALDH1/2. Ablation of K8 in a colorectal cancer cell line similarly resulted in increased IL-18 and decreased ALDH1/2. K8/K18 co-immunoprecipitated with pro-caspase-1, a component of the inflammasome in the colon, which suggests that keratins modulate inflammasome activity and protect the colon from inflammation and tumorigenesis. The K8-null mouse models also provide novel epithelial-derived robust colon-specific CRC models.},

Alterations in their metabolism can be induced by the diseases and their complications. To study the role of trace elements in IBD patients' serum zinc and copper and their related enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), activity were measured in patients with IBD patients as well as in healthy subjects. In addition, the correlation between serum trace element levels, albumin, total protein, urea level, copper/zinc ratio, and disease activity (DA) was determined in these subjects. Serum samples were obtained from 35 patients (19 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 16 Crohn's disease (CD)) in the active phase of the disease and 30 healthy control subjects. Serum levels of zinc, copper, SOD activity, albumin, total protein, and urea were measured. The results were compared between the two groups using independent Student's t test in statistical analysis. Serum levels of zinc, SOD activity, albumin, and total protein were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in patients than controls, while serum urea level was significantly higher in patients compared to controls. Copper concentrations did not differ between patients with IBD (mean +/- SD, 58.8 +/- 20.7 mug/d) and controls (55.57 +/- 12.6 mug/d). Decreased levels of zinc and SOD activity are associated with increased inflammatory processes indicating inappropriate antioxidant system in patients with IBD. Additionally, lower levels of albumin and total protein with higher level of urea reflect metabolic problems in liver system.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is chronic inflammation, which leads to excessive extracellular matrix [ECM] remodelling and release of specific protein fragments, called neoepitopes. We speculated that the biomarker profile panel for ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD] represent a heterogeneous expression pattern, and may be applied as a tool to aid in the differentiation between UC and CD. METHODS: Serum biomarkers of degraded collagens I, III-IV [C1M, C3M, and C4M], collagen type 1 and IV formation [P1NP, P4NP], and citrullinated and MMP-degraded vimentin [VICM] were studied with a competitive ELISA assay system in a cohort including 164 subjects [CD n = 72, UC n = 60, and non-IBD controls n = 32] and a validation cohort of 61 subjects [CD n = 46, and UC n = 15]. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and logistic regression modelling were carried out to evaluate the discriminative power of the biomarkers. RESULTS: All biomarkers were corrected for confounding factors. VICM and C3M demonstrated the highest diagnostic power, alone, to differentiate CD from UC with an area under the curve [AUC] of 0.77 and 0.69, respectively. Furthermore, the biomarkers C1M [AUC = 0.81], C3M [AUC = 0.83], VICM [AUC = 0.83], and P1NP [AUC = 0.77] were best to differentiate UC from non-IBD. The best combinations of biomarkers to differentiate CD from UC and UC from non-IBD were VICM, C3M, C4M [AUC = 0.90] and VICM, C3M [AUC = 0.98] respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Specific extracellular matrix degradation markers are elevated in IBD and can discriminate CD from UC and UC from non-IBD controls with a high diagnostic accuracy.},

This study aims to evaluate the action of LA and/or NAC, on oxidative stress and inflammation markers in colonic and hepatic rat tissues with mild UC, induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) (2% w/v). LA and/or NAC (100 mg.kg.day-1, each) were given, once a day, in the diet, in a pretreatment phase (7 days) and during UC induction (5 days). Colitis induction was confirmed by histological and biochemical analyses (high performance liquid chromatography, spectrophotometry, and Multiplex(R)). A redox imbalance occurred before an immunological disruption in the colon. NAC led to a decrease in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and myeloperoxidase activity. In the liver, DSS did not cause damage but treatments with both antioxidants were potentially harmful, with LA increasing MDA and LA + NAC increasing H2O2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and transaminases. In summary, NAC exhibited the highest colonic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, while LA + NAC caused hepatic damage.},

   abstract = {Studies in transgenic murine models have provided insight into the complexity underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a disease hypothesized to result from an injurious immune response against intestinal microbiota. We recently developed a mouse model of IBD that phenotypically and histologically resembles human childhood-onset ulcerative colitis (UC), using mice that are genetically modified to be deficient in the cytokines TNF and IL-10 ("T/I" mice). Here we report the effects of early life onset of colon inflammation on growth and reproductive performance of T/I mice. T/I dams with colitis often failed to get pregnant or had small litters with pups that failed to thrive. Production was optimized by breeding double homozygous mutant T/I males to females homozygous mutant for TNF deficiency and heterozygous for deficiency of IL-10 ("T/I-het" dams) that were not susceptible to spontaneous colon inflammation. When born to healthy (T/I-het) dams, T/I pups initially gained weight similarly to wild type (WT) pups and to their non-colitis-susceptible T/I-het littermates. However, their growth curves diverged between 8 and 13 weeks, when most T/I mice had developed moderate to severe colitis. The observed growth failure in T/I mice occurred despite a significant increase in their food consumption and in the absence of protein loss in the stool. This was not due to TNF-induced anorexia or altered food consumption due to elevated leptin levels. Metabolic studies demonstrated increased consumption of oxygen and water and increased production of heat and CO2 in T/I mice compared to their T/I-het littermates, without differences in motor activity. Based on the clinical similarities of this early life onset model of IBD in T/I mice to human IBD, these results suggest that mechanisms previously hypothesized to explain growth failure in children with IBD require re-evaluation. The T/I mouse model may be useful for further investigation of such mechanisms and for development of therapies to prevent reproductive complications and/or growth failure in humans with IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Because ulcerative colitis (UC) repeats remission and relapse, it is necessary to keep the condition at the relapse time in mind when considering support to provide UC suffers with at the workplace. The aim of this survey was to clarify the difficulties at work and work motivation that UC suffers feel at present and experience at the worsening time, and the factors for maintaining work motivation. METHODS: We carried out an anonymous questionnaire survey of patients with present or past work experience. The difficulties at work (17 items) and work motivation (4 items) in the past week and at the time when the symptoms were most intensive during work were investigated using a newly designed questionnaire. We regarded the time in the past week as the present, and the time when the symptoms were most intensive during work as the worsening time. RESULTS: There were 70 respondents (response rate 32.0%). Their mean age was 43.8 years, and their mean age at onset was 33.8 years. All subjects, except 2 subjects after surgery, took medicine. Fifty-three (75.7%) of the subjects were in remission at the present, and most of them (91.4%) managed their physical condition well. Difficulties at work that many subjects worried about at the present were relevant to work conditions, such as "Others at workplace do not understand having an intractable and relapsing disease" (41.4%) or "Feel delayed or lack of chance of promotion or career advancement due to the disease" (38.6%). At the worsening time, the management of physical condition went wrong, and the frequency of hospital visits was increased, but few subjects consulted with superiors or colleagues at workplace. Difficulties at work that many subjects underwent at the worsening time were relevant to symptoms, such as "Feel physically tired" (80.0%) or "Decline foods or alcoholic beverages offered at business parties" (72.9%). Those who maintained work motivation even at the worsening time received no work-related consideration and had an adviser in the workplace to talk to about the disease. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that to provide UC suffers with support at the workplace, it is important to create a working atmosphere in which UC suffers can easily notify superiors and colleagues of their disease or can consult a doctor regularly, and for the superiors and colleagues to become advisors in the workplace to talk to about disease and work.},

   abstract = {Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequent cancers in Western countries. Chronic intestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, in which the intestinal barrier is massively disturbed, significantly raise the risk of developing a colorectal tumour. 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) is a genotoxic heterocyclic aromatic amine that is formed after strongly heating fish and meat. In this study, the hypothesis that PhIP uptake in the gut is increased during chronic colitis was tested. Chronic colitis was induced by oral administration of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) to Fischer 344 rats. The transport of PhIP in eight different rat intestinal segments was examined in Ussing chambers. The tissues were incubated with 10 microM PhIP for 90 min, and the concentration of PhIP was determined in the mucosal and serosal compartments of the Ussing chambers as well as in the clamped tissues by LC-MS. Although chronic colitis was clearly induced in the rats, no differences in the intestinal transport of PhIP were observed between control and DSS-treated animals. The hypothesis that in the course of chronic colitis more PhIP is taken up by the intestinal epithelium, thereby increasing the risk of developing colorectal cancer, could not be confirmed in the present report.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex, multi-factorial disease thought to arise from an inappropriate immune response to commensal bacteria in a genetically susceptible person that results in chronic, cyclical, intestinal inflammation. Dietary and environmental factors are implicated in the initiation and perpetuation of IBD; however, a singular causative agent has not been identified. As of now, the role of environmental priming or triggers in IBD onset and pathogenesis are not well understood, but these factors appear to synergize with other disease susceptibility factors. In previous work, we determined that the polysaccharide dietary additive, maltodextrin (MDX), impairs cellular anti-bacterial responses and suppresses intestinal anti-microbial defense mechanisms. In this addendum, we review potential mechanisms for dietary deregulation of intestinal homeostasis, postulate how dietary and genetic risk factors may combine to result in disease pathogenesis, and discuss these ideas in the context of recent findings related to dietary interventions for IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Barwon area in Australia has one of the highest incidence rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and therefore is an ideal location to study the impact of environmental exposures on the disease's development. AIM: To study these exposures prior to the development of IBD in a population-based cohort. METHOD: One hundred and thirty-two incident cases (81 Crohn disease (CD) and 51 ulcerative colitis (UC)) from an IBD registry and 104 controls replied to the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases environmental questionnaire. This included 87 questions about pre-illness exposures that included childhood illnesses, vaccinations, breastfeeding, house amenities, pets and swimming, diet and smoking. RESULTS: The factors associated with CD included smoking (odds ratio (OR): 1.42, confidence interval (CI): 1-2.02, P = 0.029); childhood events, including tonsillectomy (OR: 1.74, CI: 1.15-2.6, P = 0.003) and chicken pox infection (OR: 3.89, CI: 1.61-9.4, P = 0.005) and pre-diagnosis intake of frequent fast food (OR: 2.26, CI: 1.76-4.33, P = 0.003). In UC, the risk factors included smoking (OR: 1.39, CI: 1.1-1.92, P = 0.026) and pre-diagnosis intake of frequent fast food (OR: 2.91, CI: 1.54-5.58, P < 0.001), and high caffeine intake was protective (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.3-0.87, P = 0.002). Other protective exposures for UC included high fruit intake (OR: 0.59, CI: 0.4-0.88, P = 0.003) and having pets as a child (OR: 0.36, CI: 0.2-0.79, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This first Australian population-based study of environmental risk factors confirms that smoking, childhood immunological events and dietary factors play a role in IBD development; while high caffeine intake and pet ownership offer a protective effect.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine environmental factors associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Yunnan Province, a southwestern highland region of China. METHODS: In this nested case-control study, newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis (UC) cases in 2 cities in Yunnan Province and Crohn's disease (CD) cases in 16 cities in Yunnan Province were recruited between 2008 and 2013. Controls were matched by geography, sex and age at a ratio of 1:4. Data were collected using the designed questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: A total of 678 UC and 102 CD cases were recruited. For UC, various factors were associated with an increased risk of developing UC: dietary habits, including frequent irregular meal times; consumption of fried foods, salty foods and frozen dinners; childhood factors, including intestinal infectious diseases and frequent use of antibiotics; and other factors, such as mental labor, high work stress, use of non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and allergies (OR > 1, p < 0.05). Other factors showed a protective effect: such as consumption of fruits, current smoking, physical activity, and drinking tea (OR < 1, p < 0.05). For CD, appendectomy and irregular meal times increased the disease risk (OR >1, p < 0.05), whereas physical activity may have reduced this risk (OR < 1, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first nested case-control study to analyze the association between environmental factors and IBD onset in a southwestern highland region of China. Certain dietary habits, lifestyles, allergies and childhood factors may play important roles in IBD, particularly UC.},

The colitis was induced in rats by dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). The effect of natural honey on induced colitis was assessed by the following parameters in colonic samples: tissue injury, inflammatory infiltration, interleukin-1beta and -6, superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione. In addition, the expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, inducible NO synthase, caspase-3, CD34, Ki67, S100, c-kit, and neuron-specific enolase were examined by immunohistochemistry. Compared to the DSS-induced colitis group, the honey-treated group had significantly improved macroscopic and microscopic scores and exhibited the down-regulation of oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers. In addition, up-regulation of intrinsic muscular innervation and epithelial cellular proliferation markers was detected. These results provide new insight into the beneficial role of natural honey in the treatment of DSS-induced colitis via the inhibition of colonic motor dysfunction and the inflammatory-oxidative-apoptotic cascade. In addition, the role of honey in epithelial regeneration was clarified.},

   abstract = {Pulse granulomata (PG) in the lung and oral pathology literature are presumed due to food (pulse) introduced by mucosal injury. Herein, we report the largest series of PG in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT): 22 resections were prospectively collected from 17 patients (8 men, range=28 to 85 y). All patients had a history of intestinal injury/disease: diverticulitis, fistula, adenocarcinoma, perforation, ulcerative colitis, appendicitis, anastomotic site leak, and/or stent leak. Nine of 22 specimens were designated "masses"; most of these were clinically concerning for neoplasia. Sites of involvement included the small and large intestine, appendix, liver, gallbladder, mesentery, omentum, peritoneum, cervix, ovary, and skin. PG were typically nodular (21/22) and multifocal (15/22); most involved the external surface of the bowel (20/22), and they ranged in size from 1.5 to 100 mm. Histologically, they contained variable amounts of hyaline ribbons and rings, inflammation, foreign body giant cells, calcifications, and food; larger lesions displayed circumferential stellate fibrosis (12/22). We describe 3 morphologic variants: hyaline predominant (mimicking amyloid), cellular predominant (mimicking spindle cell neoplasms), and sclerosing mesenteritis-like. All patients are alive and well at the time of follow-up. Histologically processed legumes showed similar structures as those identified in PG, providing support for an entrapped food origin. In summary, we detail important clinicopathologic clues, describe the PG morphologic spectrum, and demonstrate how to distinguish PG from their mimics. Although PG can present as clinically concerning masses, we conclude that they are pseudotumors arising secondary to entrapped food introduced through mucosal trauma, similar to their lung and oral counterparts.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite dietary factors being implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), nutritional therapy, outside of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN), has not had a defined role within the treatment paradigm of pediatric IBD within IBD centers. Based on emerging data, Seattle Children's Hospital IBD Center has developed an integrated dietary program incorporating the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) into its treatment paradigm. This treatment paradigm uses the SCD as primary therapy as well as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of the SCD on clinical outcomes and laboratory studies of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed the medical records of patients with IBD on SCD. RESULTS: We analyzed 26 children on the SCD: 20 with CD and 6 with UC. Duration of the dietary therapy ranged from 3 to 48 mo. In patients with active CD (Pediatric Crohn's Disease activity index [PCDAI] >10), PCDAI dropped from 32.8 +/- 13.2 at baseline to 20.8 +/- 16.6 by 4 +/- 2 wk, and to 8.8 +/- 8.5 by 6 mo. The mean Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for patients with active UC decreased from a baseline of 28.3 +/- 10.3 to 20.0 +/- 17.3 at 4 +/- 2 wk, to 18.3 +/- 31.7 at 6 mo. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review provides evidence that the SCD can be integrated into a tertiary care center and may improve clinical and laboratory parameters for pediatric patients with nonstructuring, nonpenetrating CD as well as UC. Further prospective studies are needed to fully assess the safety and efficacy of the SCD in pediatric patients with IBD.},

METHODS: The clinical records of patients who underwent 89 restorative proctocolectomy procedures with IPAA were reviewed. After determining which patients underwent LAP-IPAA versus open IPAA, an equivalent number of controls matched for age and ulcerative colitis severity were selected. RESULTS: Twenty of 22 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery met the inclusion criteria. Patients who underwent LAP-IPAA had significantly shorter times to first walking (P=0.021) and food intake (P=0.0003). The LAP-IPAA group had significantly lower interleukin-6 and interleukin-1ra levels soon after surgery (P=0.011 and P=0.0076). The LAP-IPAA group had significantly lower C-reactive protein levels on postoperative day 1 (P=0.0027). CONCLUSIONS: LAP-IPAA is a less-invasive operative procedure than open IPAA with respect to the postoperative systemic inflammatory response and postoperative recovery.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To discuss current terminology and the regulatory standards and processes involved in the development of biosimilars. METHODS: An Internet-based literature search through April 2015 was performed for information related to biosimilars in chronic inflammatory disorders. Keywords were as follows: biosimilar, development, manufacturing, characterization, structural, functional, preclinical, clinical, immunogenicity, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) websites were searched for guidelines and information related to biosimilars. RESULTS: Biosimilars are products that are highly similar to the reference product regarding quality, biological activity, safety, and efficacy. Biosimilars are biological products and not generic drugs and, thus, do not follow the same regulatory pathways as generic molecules. Rigorous early-stage structural, functional, and analytical testing, followed by nonclinical and clinical analyses comparing a biosimilar with its reference product, are required to demonstrate biosimilarity in regulatory markets worldwide. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of biosimilars to the market has the potential to improve access to biologic therapies. Many regulatory agencies have enacted stringent pathways, which must be followed for a biosimilar to be labeled and approved as such; following the pathways will help protect and maintain the integrity, quality, and safety of the biosimilar product.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dairy products may be involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease by modulating gut microbiota and immune responses, but data from epidemiological studies examining this relationship are limited. We investigated the association between prediagnostic intake of these foods and dietary calcium, and the subsequent development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In total, 401,326 participants were enrolled in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. At recruitment, consumption of total and specific dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and dietary calcium was measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. Cases developing incident CD (n = 110) or UC (n = 244) during follow-up were matched with 4 controls. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for total energy intake and smoking. RESULTS: Compared with the lowest quartile, the ORs for the highest quartile of total dairy products and dietary calcium intake were 0.61 (95% CI, 0.32-1.19, p trend = 0.19) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.28-1.42, p trend = 0.23) for CD, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.50-1.30, p trend = 0.40) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.49-1.34, p trend = 0.60) for UC, respectively. Compared with nonconsumers, individuals consuming milk had significantly reduced odds of CD (OR 0.30, 95% CI, 0.13-0.65) and nonsignificantly reduced odds of UC (OR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.49-1.47). CONCLUSIONS: Milk consumption may be associated with a decreased risk of developing CD, although a clear dose-response relationship was not established. Further studies are warranted to confirm this possible protective effect.},

Our objective was to examine the impact of prior consumption of LAM and/or FUC on pathology and inflammation following a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) challenge in pigs. Pigs (n 7/group) were assigned to one of five experimental groups for 56 d. From 49-55 d, distilled water or DSS was administered intragastrically. The experimental groups were: (1) basal diet + distilled water (control); (2) basal diet + DSS (DSS); (3) basal diet + FUC + DSS (FUC + DSS); (4) basal diet + LAM + DSS (LAM + DSS); and (5) basal diet + LAM + FUC + DSS (LAMFUC + DSS). The DSS group had decreased body-weight gain (P < 0.05) and serum xylose (P < 0.05), and increased proximal colon pathology score (P < 0.05), diarrhoeal score (P < 0.001) and colonic Enterobacteriaceae (P < 0.05) relative to the control group. The FUC + DSS (P < 0.01), LAM + DSS (P < 0.05) and LAMFUC + DSS (P < 0.05) groups had improved diarrhoeal score, and the LAMFUC + DSS (P < 0.05) group had improved body weight relative to the DSS group. The FUC + DSS group (P < 0.001), LAM + DSS group (P < 0.05) and LAMFUC + DSS group (P < 0.001) had lower IL-6 mRNA abundance relative to the DSS group. The LAM + DSS group had reduced Enterobacteriaceae in proximal colon digesta relative to the DSS group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, FUC or a combination of FUC and LAM improved body-weight loss, diarrhoeal scores and clinical variables associated with a DSS challenge in pigs, in tandem with a reduction in colonic IL-6 mRNA abundance.},

   abstract = {There is increasing scientific interest in the field of vitamin D research, moving the focus beyond bone health to other disease processes. Low circulating vitamin D levels have been reported as a risk factor for several pathophysiologically divergent diseases, including cancers, diabetes, CVD, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But, therein, remains the challenge: can any single nutrient contribute to multiple complex disease mechanisms and, ultimately, have therapeutic potential? The aim of this review is to critically evaluate several strands of scientific evidence surrounding vitamin D and inflammation, primarily focusing on IBD. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased incidence of IBD and rheumatoid arthritis in countries of more northern latitudes, mirroring sunlight patterns. A considerable body of evidence supports the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, at least in animal models of IBD. Although it is accepted that suboptimal vitamin D status is common in IBD, some studies suggest that this associates with more severe disease. With regard to treatment, the data are only beginning to emerge from randomised controlled trials to suggest that people with IBD may remain in remission longer when treated with oral vitamin D. In conclusion, several strands of evidence suggest that vitamin D may modify the immune response in IBD. There is a continued need for large well-designed clinical trials and mechanistic studies to determine if, and how, this emerging promise translates into tangible clinical benefits for people with chronic debilitating diseases such as IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by wasting and chronic intestinal inflammation triggered by various cytokine-mediated pathways. In recent years, it was shown that T helper 17 (Th17) cells are involved in the pathogenesis of IBD, which makes them an attractive therapeutic target. Th17 cells preferentially produce interleukin (IL)-17A-F as signature cytokines. The role of the interplay between host genetics and intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD was demonstrated. Probiotics are live microorganisms that when orally ingested in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host by modulating the enteric flora or by stimulating the local immune system. Several studies indicated the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing and treating IBD (ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease). Furthermore, there is mounting evidence of probiotics selectively targeting the Th17 lineage in the prevention and management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as IBD. This review highlights critical roles of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of IBD and the rationale for using probiotics as a novel therapeutic approach for IBD through manipulation of Th17 cells. The potential molecular mechanisms by which probiotics modulate Th17 cells differentiation and production are also discussed.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development is affected by complex interactions between environmental factors, changes in intestinal flora, various predisposing genetic properties and changes in the immune system. Dietary factors seem to play an underestimated role in the etiopathogenesis and course of the disease. However, research about food and IBD is conflicting. An excessive consumption of sugar, animal fat and linoleic acid is considered a risk factor for IBD development, whereas a high fiber diet and citrus fruit consumption may play a protective role. Also, appropriate nutrition in particular periods of the disease may facilitate achieving or prolonging remissions and most of all, improve the quality of life for patients. During disease exacerbation, a low fiber diet is recommended for most patients. In the remission time, an excessive consumption of alcohol and sulfur products may have a negative effect on the disease course. Attempts are also made at employing diets composed in detail in order to supplement IBD therapy. A diet with a modified carbohydrate composition, a semi-vegetarian diet and a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols are under investigation. Due to chronic inflammation as well as side effects of chronically used medications, patients with IBD are also at increased risk of nutritional factor deficiencies, including iron, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, folic acid, zinc, magnesium and vitamin A. It should also be remembered that there is no single common diet suitable for all IBD patients; each of them is unique and dietary recommendations must be individually developed for each patient, depending on the course of the disease, past surgical procedures and type of pharmacotherapy.},

   abstract = {AIM: Intestinal dysbiosis seems to be the leading cause of inflammatory bowel diseases, and probiotics seems to represent the proper support against their occurrence. Actually, probiotic blends and anti-inflammatory drugs represent a weapon against inflammatory bowel diseases. The present study evaluates the long-term (2 years) effects of combination therapy (mesalazine plus a probiotic blend of Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidus strain BGN4) on ulcerative colitis activity. METHOD: Sixty patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were enrolled: 30 of them were treated with a single daily oral administration of mesalazine 1200 mg; 30 patients received a single daily oral administration of mesalazine 1200 mg and a double daily administration of a probiotic blend of Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidus strain BGN4. The treatment was carried out for two years and the clinical response evaluated according to the Modified Mayo Disease Activity Index. RESULTS: All patients treated with combination therapy showed better improvement compared to the controls. In particular, the beneficial effects of probiotics were evident even after two years of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A long-term treatment modality of anti-inflammatory drugs and probiotics is viable and could be an alternative to corticosteroids in mild-to moderate ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary fiber intake leading to short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production could be a strategy to combat intermittent bouts of inflammation during ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate dietary potato fiber (PF) in attenuating inflammation using a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. We hypothesized that PF would show anti-inflammatory effects compared with cellulose due in part to SCFA production. METHODS: Male C57Bl/6J mice were fed diets containing either 8% cellulose or 14.5% PF for a 22-d feeding study. Starting on study day 14, mice were provided either distilled water (control) or 2% (wt:vol) DSS in drinking water for 5 d (cellulose+control, n = 17; PF+control, n = 16; cellulose+DSS, n = 17; and PF+DSS, n = 16). Body weights and food and water intakes were collected daily from day 14 through day 22. Distal colon tissue was analyzed for histologic outcomes and changes in gene expression, and cecal contents were analyzed for SCFA concentrations. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, with repeated measures applied where necessary. RESULTS: At day 5 post-DSS induction, cellulose+DSS mice exhibited a 2% reduction (P < 0.05) in body weight compared with PF+DSS and PF+ and cellulose+control mice. PF+DSS mice had greater (P < 0.05) cecal butyrate concentrations [24.5 mumol/g dry matter (DM)] than did cellulose+DSS mice (4.93 mumol/g DM). Mice fed PF+DSS had lower (P < 0.05) infiltration of leukocytes in the distal colon than did mice fed cellulose+DSS (mean histology scores of 1.22 and 2.30, respectively). Furthermore, mice fed cellulose+DSS exhibited 1.42, 11.5, 8.48, and 35.5 times greater (P < 0.05) colon mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnfa) and interleukin (Il) 1b, Il6, and Il17a, respectively, and 7.10 times greater (P < 0.05) expression of C-X-C motif ligand 1 (Cxc1) compared with mice fed PF+DSS. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PF fed to mice before and during DSS colitis attenuates inflammation, potentially through SCFA production; however, future studies are needed to understand the role of dietary fiber intake and immune activation.},

Here, we describe meningitis caused by Listeria monocytogenes developing in a 37-year-old man with ulcerative colitis refractory to intravenous corticosteroids 10 days after receiving his first infusion of infliximab. With the increasing use of tumour necrosis factor-alpha-neutralizing agents, clinicians should be aware of the risk of opportunistic infections caused by L. monocytogenes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease following infliximab treatment. The half-life of infliximab is 9.5 days; therefore, patients tend to be more susceptible in the immediate period following infusion. Patients receiving anti-TNF therapy should be advised to avoid foods such as soft cheeses and unpasteurized dairy products.},

   abstract = {Conventional medical treatment for ulcerative colitis can have limited efficacy or severe adverse reactions requiring additional treatment or colectomy. Hence, different biological agents that target specific immunological pathways are be-ing investigated for treating ulcerative colitis. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents were the first biologics to be used for treating inflammatory bowel disease. For example, infliximab and adalimumab, which are anti-TNF agents, are be-ing used for treating ulcerative colitis. Recently, golimumab, another anti-TNF agent, and vedolizumab, an anti-adhesion therapy, have been approved for ulcerative colitis by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In addition, new medications such as tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, and etrolizumab, another anti-adhesion therapy, are emerging as therapeutic agents. Therefore, there is a need for further studies to select appropriate patient groups for these biologics and to improve the outcomes of ulcerative colitis treatment through appropriate medical usage.},

   abstract = {Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in experimental colitis, and promising clinical results have been obtained in humans with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and feasibility of adipose tissue-derived MSC (ASC) therapy in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Eleven dogs with confirmed IBD received one ASC intravascular (IV) infusion (2 x 10(6) cells/kg bodyweight). The outcome measures were clinical response based on percentage reduction of the validated Clinical Inflammatory Bowel Disease Activity Index (CIBDAI) and Canine Chronic Enteropathy Clinical Activity Index (CCECAI), as well as normalisation of C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, folate and cobalamin serum concentrations at day 42 post-treatment. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare variables before and after treatment. No acute reaction to ASC infusion and no side effects were reported during follow-up in any dog. Six weeks post-treatment, the CIBDAI and CCECAI decreased significantly and albumin, cobalamin and folate concentrations increased substantially. Differences in CRP concentrations pre- and post-treatment were not significant (P = 0.050). Clinical remission (defined by a reduction of initial CIBDAI and CCECAI >75%) occurred in 9/11 dogs at day 42. The two remaining dogs showed a partial response with reduction percentages of 69.2% and 71.4%. In conclusion, a single IV infusion of allogeneic ASCs was well tolerated and appeared to produce clinical benefits in dogs with severe IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an inflammatory disorder caused by hyperactivation of effector immune cells that produce high levels of proinflammatory cytokines. The aims of our study were to determine whether orally administered blueberry extract (BE) could attenuate or prevent the development of experimental colitis in mice and to elucidate the mechanism of action. Female Balb/C mice (n=7) were randomized into groups differing in treatment conditions (prevention and treatment) and dose of BE (50 mg/kg body weight). Acute ulcerative colitis was induced by oral administration of 3% dextran sodium sulfate for 7 days in drinking water. Colonic mucosal injury was assessed by clinical, macroscopic, biochemical and histopathological examinations. BE significantly decreased disease activity index and improved the macroscopic and histological score of colons when compared to the colitis group (P<.05). BE markedly attenuated myeloperoxidase accumulation (colitis group 54.97+/-2.78 nmol/mg, treatment group 30.78+/-1.33 nmol/mg) and malondialdehyde in colon and prostaglandin E2 level in serum while increasing the levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase (colitis group 11.94+/-1.16 U/ml, BE treatment group 16.49+/-0.39 U/ml) compared with the colitis group (P<.05). mRNA levels of the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-1beta and inducible nitric oxide synthase cytokines were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that BE attenuates the expression of COX-2 and IL-1beta in colonic tissue. Moreover, BE reduced the nuclear translocation of nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) by immunofluorescence analysis. Thus, the anti-inflammatory effect of BE at colorectal sites is a result of a number of mechanisms: antioxidation, down-regulation of the expression of inflammatory mediators and inhibition of the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB.},

   abstract = {The immune response is a very complex interplay of specific and nonspecific branches that have evolved to distinguish between nondangerous and dangerous or nontolerated factors. In the past, research has focused on the specific immune system much more than the host's innate defense. Studies have shown that a key component of the immune response involves activation of the inflammasome. A direct relationship between the presence of the inflammasome and the onset of disease has already been characterized for a variety of chronic and food-related diseases, including arthrosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, and chronic bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The leukocyte activation (ALCAT test), an immunological blood test for food intolerance reactions, is ideal to identify and eliminate individual food stimuli that may act as triggers for the cellular nonspecific immune response. Although the test is not diagnostic, studies have established that it can be a useful screening tool for the identification of foreign substances that may trigger immune cell activation, particularly of neutrophils, leading to inflammatory disorders. The ALCAT test, coupled with a targeted diet that is individually tailored according to the test's results, may support immune homeostasis and provide a valuable complementary approach for therapy and overall health.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) constitutes a growing public health concern in western countries. Bacteria with anti-inflammatory properties are lacking in the dysbiosis accompanying IBD. Selected strains of probiotic bacteria with anti-inflammatory properties accordingly alleviate symptoms and enhance treatment of ulcerative colitis in clinical trials. Such properties are also found in selected strains of dairy starters such as Propionibacterium freudenreichii and Lactobacillus delbrueckii (Ld). We thus investigated the possibility to develop a fermented dairy product, combining both starter and probiotic abilities of both lactic acid and propionic acid bacteria, designed to extend remissions in IBD patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a single-strain Ld-fermented milk and a two-strain P. freudenreichii and Ld-fermented experimental pressed cheese using strains previously selected for their anti-inflammatory properties. Consumption of these experimental fermented dairy products protected mice against trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid induced colitis, alleviating severity of symptoms, modulating local and systemic inflammation, as well as colonic oxidative stress and epithelial cell damages. As a control, the corresponding sterile dairy matrix failed to afford such protection. CONCLUSION: This work reveals the probiotic potential of this bacterial mixture, in the context of fermented dairy products. It opens new perspectives for the reverse engineering development of anti-inflammatory fermented foods designed for target populations with IBD, and has provided evidences leading to an ongoing pilot clinical study in ulcerative colitis patients.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and ulcers in the colon. The disease is a type of colitis, which is a group of diseases that cause inflammation of the colon, the largest section of the large intestine, either in segments or completely. The main symptom of this active disease is diarrhea mixed with blood. In Ayurveda, it can be compared with a disease Pravahika characterized by Atidrava Mala Pravrutti with Rakta. A 30 year old female patient reported to the out patient Department of Panchakarma, NIA, Jaipur, with the complaints of frequent loose, watery, frothy, and foul-smelling stool stained with mucous and blood. Other associated complaints were reduced appetite, distension and pain in the abdomen, weakness, heat intolerance, reduced sleep, and headache. The patient was diagnosed as IBD consistent with UC. A combination of Nagarmotha (Cyperus rotundus L.) 2 g, Indrayava (Holarrhena antidysenterica (L.) Wall.) 1 g, Nagakeshara (Mesua ferrea L.) 1 g, Madhuyashti (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.) 1 g, and Amalaki (Emblica officinalis Gaertn.) 1 g powders three times a day, along with Dadimashtaka Choorna 3 g with Shankha Bhasma 500mg three times a day, Mustarista 2 tsp three times a day after food, and Dhanyapanchaka Kvatha 20ml two times a day before food was administered for 2months. After the 2-month treatment, a significant response in various symptoms such as frequent defecation, abdomen distension, headache, heat intolerance, and reduced sleep was found.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anaemia is the most common complication in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aims to assess the prevalence of anaemia in IBD patients and to know its characteristics with regard to the main IBD clinical features. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional multicentre study was conducted. We included all patients who had an appointment at the 15 participating centres during the period of 1 month, and who met the following selection criteria: age >/=18, diagnosis of IBD. Disease activity was evaluated by Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) for Crohn's disease (CD), and by Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) for ulcerative colitis (UC). RESULTS: One thousand three hundred and thirteen patients, were included: 54.8% female, mean age 42.8 (interquartile range (25th-75th): 31-53 years), 59% had a diagnosis of CD, 39% of UC and 2% IBD unclassified. The median follow-up since diagnosis was 7 years. The ongoing treatment was aminosalicylates (63.1%), corticosteroids (11.6%), immunomodulators (36.4%) and anti-tumour necrosis factor (27.3%). Anaemia was identified in 244 patients, representing a prevalence of 18.6% (95% CI 16.6-20.9). A majority of cases (90%) have mild/moderate anaemia (mean haemoglobin 11.3 +/- 0.8 g/dl). Anaemia was significantly higher in females (p = 0.006), but there were no differences between CDs (19.1%) and UCs (17.7%; p = 0.688). Anaemia was more frequent in patients with active disease (HBI >4; SCCAI >2) than in those in clinical remission (33.6 vs. 15.6%, p < 0.001) and in patients on steroids (36.8%) vs. other treatments (p < 0.001). Only 47% of patients with anaemia were under any specific treatment (oral iron 67%; intravenous iron 41%). CONCLUSION: Anaemia was more frequent in patients with active disease and in those on corticosteroids. The treatment of anaemia still seems undervalued, whereas more than half of anaemic patients were not receiving any specific treatment and the use of oral iron prevails contrarily to current recommendations.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a multifactorial disorder with many different putative influences mediating disease onset, severity, progression and diminution. Spontaneous natural IBD is classically expressed as Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) commonly found in primates; lymphoplasmocytic enteritis, eosinophilic gastritis and colitis, and ulcerative colitis with neuronal hyperplasia in dogs; and colitis in horses. Spontaneous inflammatory bowel disease has been noted in a number of rodent models which differ in genetic strain background, induced mutation, microbiota influences and immunopathogenic pathways. Histological lesions in Crohn's Disease feature noncaseating granulomatous inflammation while UC lesions typically exhibit ulceration, lamina propria inflammatory infiltrates and lack of granuloma development. Intestinal inflammation caused by CD and UC is also associated with increased incidence of intestinal neoplasia. Transgenic murine models have determined underlying etiological influences and appropriate therapeutic targets in IBD. This literature review will discuss current opinion and findings in spontaneous IBD, highlight selected transgenic rodent models of IBD and discuss their respective pathogenic mechanisms. It is very important to provide accommodation of induced putative deficits in activities of daily living and to assess discomfort and pain levels in the face of significant morbidity and/or mortality in these models. Epigenetic, environmental (microbiome, metabolome) and nutritional factors are important in IBD pathogenesis, and evaluating ways in which they influence disease expression represent potential investigative approaches with the greatest potential for new discoveries.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional implications of IBD.},

   abstract = {Significant clinical success of colon targeted dosage forms has been limited by their inappropriate release profile at the target site. Their failure to release the drug completely in the colon may be attributed to changes in the colonic milieu because of pathological state, drug effect and psychological stress accompanying the diseased state or, a combination of these. Alteration in normal colonic pH and bacterial picture leads to incomplete release of drug from the designed delivery system. We report the effectiveness of a targeted delivery system wherein the constant replenishment of the colonic microbiota is achieved by concomitant administration of probiotics along with the polysaccharide based drug delivery system. Guar gum coated spheroids of sulfasalazine were prepared. In the dissolution studies, these spheroids showed markedly higher release in the simulated colonic fluid. In vivo experiments conducted in rats clearly demonstrated the therapeutic advantage of co-administration of probiotics with guar gum coated spheroids. Our results suggest that concomitant use of probiotics along with the polysaccharide based delivery systems can be a simple strategy to achieve satisfactory colon targeting of drugs.},

   abstract = {Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit impaired control of the microbiome in the gut, and 'dysbiosis' is commonly observed. Western diet is a risk factor for the development of IBD, but it may have different effects on gut microbiota between IBD and non-IBD individuals. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) can induce remission in pediatric Crohn's disease with a decrease in gut microbial diversity. Although there are some theoretical benefits, actual treatment effects of prebiotics and probiotics in IBD vary. High-quality studies have shown that VSL#3 (a high-potency probiotic medical food containing eight different strains) exhibits benefits in treating ulcerative colitis, and gut microbial diversity is reduced after treated with VSL#3 in animal models. The effect of fecal microbiome transplantation on IBD is controversial. Increasing microbial diversity compared with impaired handling of bacteria presents a dilemma. Antibiotics are the strongest factors in the reduction of microbiome ecological diversity. Some antibiotics may help to induce remission of the disease. Microbiome alteration has been suggested to be an intrinsic property of IBD and a potential predictor in diagnosis and prognosis. However, the effects of therapeutic modulations are variable; thus, more questions remain to be answered.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Specific nutrients or foods have been inconsistently associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) risks. Thus, we investigated associations between diet as a whole, as dietary patterns, and UC and CD risks. METHODS: Within the prospective EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer) study, we set up a nested matched case-control study among 366,351 participants with inflammatory bowel disease data, including 256 incident cases of UC and 117 of CD, and 4 matched controls per case. Dietary intake was recorded at baseline from validated food frequency questionnaires. Incidence rate ratios of developing UC and CD were calculated for quintiles of the Mediterranean diet score and a posteriori dietary patterns produced by factor analysis. RESULTS: No dietary pattern was associated with either UC or CD risks. However, when excluding cases occurring within the first 2 years after dietary assessment, there was a positive association between a "high sugar and soft drinks" pattern and UC risk (incidence rate ratios for the fifth versus first quintile, 1.68 [1.00-2.82]; Ptrend = 0.02). When considering the foods most associated with the pattern, high consumers of sugar and soft drinks were at higher UC risk only if they had low vegetables intakes. CONCLUSIONS: A diet imbalance with high consumption of sugar and soft drinks and low consumption of vegetables was associated with UC risk. Further studies are needed to investigate whether microbiota alterations or other mechanisms mediate this association.},

The present study focuses on phosphorylation of psyllium seed polysaccharide (PPS) using sodium tri-meta phosphate as the cross-linking agent. The modified phosphorylated psyllium seed polysaccharide was then evaluated for physicochemical properties, rheological properties, spectral analysis, thermal analysis, crosslinking density and acute oral toxicity studies. The modified polysaccharide (PhPPS) has a high swelling index due to which it can be categorized as a hydrogel. The percent increase in swelling of PhPPS as compared to PPS was found to be 90.26%. The PPS & PhPPS mucilages of all strengths were found to have shear thinning properties. These findings are suggestive of the potential use of PhPPS as gelling & suspending agent. PhPPS was found to have a mucoadhesive property which was comparable with carbopol.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The role of dietary fatty acids in ulcerative colitis (UC) pathogenesis has been shown in animal models; however, human studies are rare. We hypothesized that there might be a relationship between dietary fatty acid composition and the risk of developing incident UC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Overall, 62 new cases of UC and 124 healthy age and sex-matched controls were studied. Information on usual diet was measured by a validated country-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounding variables was carried out to compare dietary fatty acid intakes between cases and controls. RESULTS: We found positive associations between dietary intake of total fat (P value for trend <0.01), oleic acid (P value for trend <0.01), saturated fatty acid (SAFA) (P value for trend = 0.02), total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (P value for trend = 0.04), and trans fat (P value for trend <0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that higher consumptions of total fats, oleic acid, SAFAs, total PUFAs, trans fat, MUFAs, and linoleic acid are significantly associated with increased risk for UC; however, no statistically significant associations were detected between the risk of disease and n-3 PUFAs and cholesterol intake.},

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the association between dietary protein intakes and the risk of developing incident UC. METHODS: Sixty two cases of UC and 124 controls were studied using country-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Group comparisons by each factor were done using chi2 test, and significance level was set at alpha= 0.05. Logistic regression adjusted for potential confounding variables was carried out. RESULTS: Univariate analysis suggested positive associations between processed meat, red meat and organ meat with risk of ulcerative colitis. Comparing highest versus lowest categories of consumption, multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis accounting for potential confounding variables indicated that patients who consumed a higher amount of processed meat were at a higher risk for developing UC (P value for trend= 0.02). Similarly, patients who consumed higher amounts of red meat were at a higher risk for UC (P value for trend= 0.01). The highest tertile of intake of organ meat was associated with an increased risk of ulcerative colitis with a statistically significant trend across tertiles (P value for trend= 0.01) when adjusted. CONCLUSION: In this case-control study we observed that higher consumptions of processed meat, red meat and organ meat were associated with increased risk for UC.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine whose effects are bloody diarrhea, cramping and bloating. The disease is usually relapsing and remitting. However, the cause of ulcerative colitis is not yet known. Due to this reason, finding an effective treatment has been a great challenge. The suggested medical treatment is usually composed of two portions; keeping the flare up from happening and treating the flare up when it has happened. Active flare ups are treated with corticosteroids. There are several hypothesis which suggest that ulcerative colitis could be due to the micro flora present in gut. For this reason, several researchers tried to modify the gut microflora with probiotics. However, there is no probiotics found that can induce emission faster than the placebo. The ulcerative colitis patients taking probiotics showed fewer and less severe symptoms during the flare up. This means that even though the probiotics did not end up the flare up faster, it slowed up the severity of the symptoms of the patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The imbalance of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the maternal diet impairs intestinal barrier development and sensitizes the colon response to inflammatory insults in the young rats. With a view to overcoming this issue, we designed this study to investigate the effect of maternal and neonatal intake of different proportions of n-6/n-3 fatty acids on colon inflammation in the young adult rats. METHODS: Female Wistar rats were assigned into four groups, and each group fed one of four semisynthetic diets, namely n-6, low n-3, n-6/n-3 and n-3 fatty acids for 8 weeks prior to mating, during gestation and lactation periods. At weaning, the pups were separated from the dams and fed diet similar to the mothers. Colitis was induced on postnatal day 35, by administering 2 % dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water for 10 days. Colitis was assessed based on the clinical and inflammatory markers in the colon. Fatty acid analysis was done in liver, RBC, colon and spleen. RESULTS: A balanced n-6/n-3 PUFA diet significantly improved the body weight loss, rectal bleeding and mortality in rats. This was associated with lower myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, TNF-alpha and IL-6, IL-8, COX-2 and iNOS levels in the colon tissues. Fatty acid analysis has shown that the arachidonic acid/docosahexaenoic acid ratio was significantly lower in liver, RBC, colon and spleen in n-6/n-3 and n-3 diet groups. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that balanced n-6/n-3 PUFA supplementation in maternal and neonatal diet alters systemic AA/DHA ratio and attenuates colon inflammation in the young adult rats.},

   abstract = {Our recent study has demonstrated that medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and monounsaturated fatty acids potentiate the beneficial effects of fish oil on risk factors of cardiovascular disease. In the present study, we have investigated the influence of MCT or olive oil on the protective and mucosal healing ability of fish oil in ulcerative colitis using cell simulation and animal models. Caco-2 cells grown in medium chain fatty acids enriched medium has exaggerated t-butyl hydroperoxide induced cell damage, GSH depletion, and IL-1beta induced IL-8 synthesis, compared to the cells grown in oleic acid & hydroxytyrosol (OT) enriched medium. Further, combined treatment of cells with eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and OT has remarkably attenuated the cell damage, and IL-8 synthesis, compared to individual treatments. To evaluate the effect of these lipid formulations in vivo, adult Wistar rats were fed diet enriched with high amount of medium chain triglycerides (MCT), virgin olive oil, or their combination with fish oil. Colitis was induced in rats using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7days followed by 10-days of recovery period. Rats of MCT group exhibit severe disease activity, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in the colon compared to the olive oil group. Furthermore, there was persistent body weight loss, loose stools, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in the rats of MCT group, even after DSS was withdrawn from drinking water. Conversely, fish oil has remarkably attenuated the DSS induced alterations in both MCT and olive oil diet groups with significantly greater effect in the olive oil group. Thus, MCT increase the susceptibility to colitis through oxidative damage and IL-8 synthesis in intestinal epithelial cells. The beneficial effects of virgin olive oil could be partially attributed to hydroxytyrosol. Combined treatment of hydroxytyrosol, oleic acid and n-3 fatty acids exhibit huge therapeutic benefits in colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interleukin-15 is an immunostimulatory cytokine overexpressed in several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, psoriasis and ulcerative colitis; thus, inhibition of IL-15-induced signaling could be clinically beneficial in these disorders. Our approach to neutralize IL-15 consisted in active immunization with structurally modified human IL-15 (mhIL-15) with the aim to induce neutralizing antibodies against native IL-15. In the present study, we characterized the antibody response in Macaca fascicularis, non-human primates that were immunized with a vaccine candidate containing mhIL-15 in Aluminum hydroxide (Alum), Montanide and Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant. RESULTS: Immunization with mhIL-15 elicited a specific antibodies response that neutralized native IL-15-dependent biologic activity in a CTLL-2 cell proliferation assay. The highest neutralizing response was obtained in macaques immunized with mhIL-15 adjuvanted in Alum. This response, which was shown to be transient, also inhibited the activity of simian IL-15 and did not affect the human IL-2-induced proliferation of CTLL-2 cells. Also, in a pool of synovial fluid cells from two Rheumatoid Arthritis patients, the immune sera slightly inhibited TNF-alpha secretion. Finally, it was observed that this vaccine candidate neither affect animal behavior, clinical status, blood biochemistry nor the percentage of IL-15-dependent cell populations, specifically CD56+ NK and CD8+ T cells. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that vaccination with mhIL-15 induced neutralizing antibodies to native IL-15 in non-human primates. Based on this fact, we propose that this vaccine candidate could be potentially beneficial for treatment of diseases where IL-15 overexpression is associated with their pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a 'prototype disease' for chronic auto-inflammatory disorders with a polygenic background and important multifaceted environmental trigger components. The environmental factors contribute both to pathogenesis and disease flares. Thus, IBD is a disease par excellence to study the interactions between host genetics, environmental factors (such as infections or smoking) and 'in-vironmental' factors - for example, our intestinal microbiota. Longitudinal intercurrent events, including the impact of long-term medication on disease progression or stabilization, can exemplarily be studied in this disease group. Whilst alterations in the human genome coding relevant variant protein products have most likely not emerged significantly over the last 50 years, the incidence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has dramatically increased in Western countries and more recently in the Asia Pacific area. An interesting concept indicates that 'Western lifestyle factors' trigger chronic intestinal inflammation or disease flares in a genetically susceptible host. To understand the disease pathogenesis as well as triggers for flares or determinants of disease courses, we must further investigate potential en(in)vironmental factors. As environmental conditions, in contrast to genetic risk factors, can be influenced, knowledge on those risk factors becomes crucial to modulate disease incidence, disease course or clinical presentation. It is obvious that prevention of environmentally triggered disease flares would be a goal most relevant for IBD patients. An increased prevalence of IBD in urban environment has been documented in Switzerland by the Swiss IBD cohort study. Several studies have attempted to identify such factors; however, only a few have been validated. The best investigated environmental factor identified in IBD cohort analyses is smoking. Other environmental factors that have been associated with clinical presentation or risk of inflammatory flares as well as increased incidence are diet and food additives. The so-called 'hygiene hypothesis' suggests that increased hygiene in childhood associated with reduced exposure to pathogens may leave the mucosal immune system insufficiently trained and thus prone to uncontrolled inflammation. Oral contraceptives and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the 2 main classes of frequently taken drugs that have been attributed to have the potential to cause flares of the disease. What is likely to be the connection between the genetic susceptibility and the environmental triggers? There is broad evidence for a critical role of the commensal enteric microbiota as a modulator of immunologic responses relevant during onset and chronification of IBD.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: Hydroxytyrosol acetate (HTy-Ac), an extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) polyphenol, has recently been reported to exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-stimulated macrophagesand ulcerative colitis. This study was designed to evaluate dietary HTy-Ac supplementation effects on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: DBA-1/J mice were fed from weaning with 0.05% HTy-Ac. After 6 weeks, arthritis was induced by type II collagen. Mice were sacrificed 42 days after first immunization. Blood was recollected and paws were histological and biochemically processed. HTy-Ac diet significantly prevent edarthritis development and decreased serum IgG1 and IgG2a, cartilage olimeric matrix protein (COMP) and metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) levels, as well as, pro-inflammatory cytokines levels (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-17A). The activation of Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathways were drastically ameliorated whereas nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expressions were significantly up-regulated in those mice fed with HTy-Ac. CONCLUSION: HTy-Ac improved the oxidative events and returned pro-inflammatory proteins expression to basal levels probably through JAK/STAT, MAPKs and NF-kappaB pathways. HTy-Ac supplement might provide a basis for developing a new dietary strategy for the prevention of rheumatoid arthritis.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic inflammation of the small intestine and colon caused by a dysregulated immune response to host intestinal microbiota in genetically susceptible subjects. A number of fermented dairy products contain lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria, some of which have been characterized as probiotics that can modify the gut microbiota and may be beneficial for the treatment and the prevention of IBD. The objective of this review was to carry out a systematic search of LAB and bifidobacteria probiotics and IBD, using the PubMed and Scopus databases, defined by a specific equation using MeSH terms and limited to human clinical trials. The use of probiotics and/or synbiotics has positive effects in the treatment and maintenance of UC, whereas in CD clear effectiveness has only been shown for synbiotics. Furthermore, in other associated IBD pathologies, such as pouchitis and cholangitis, LAB and bifidobacteria probiotics can provide a benefit through the improvement of clinical symptoms. However, more studies are needed to understand their mechanisms of action and in this way to understand the effect of probiotics prior to their use as coadjuvants in the therapy and prevention of IBD conditions.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are intestinal disorders that comprise the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These disorders have a significant effect on the quality of life of affected patients and the increasing number of IBD cases worldwide is a growing concern. Because of the overall burden of IBD and its multifactorial etiology, efforts have been made to improve the medical management of these inflammatory conditions. The classical therapeutic strategies aim to control the exacerbated host immune response with aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biological agents. Although successful in the treatment of several CD or UC conditions, these drugs have limited effectiveness, and variable responses may culminate in unpredictable outcomes. The ideal therapy should reduce inflammation without inducing immunosuppression, and remains a challenge to health care personnel. Recently, a number of additional approaches to IBD therapy, such as new target molecules for biological agents and cellular therapy, have shown promising results. A deeper understanding of IBD pathogenesis and the availability of novel therapies are needed to improve therapeutic success. This review describes the overall key features of therapies currently employed in clinical practice as well as novel and future alternative IBD treatment methods.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Oxidative stress is involved in both pathogenesis and exacerbation of ulcerative colitis (UC). This study was designed to evaluate whether resveratrol, an excellent anti-oxidant agent, can help in treatment of UC and its related oxidative stress. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty six patients with active mild to moderate disease were randomized to receive either 500 mg/day resveratrol capsules or the same amount of placebo for 6 weeks. Before and after the intervention, disease activity, quality of life, and oxidative stress were assessed using the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index Questionnaire (SCCAIQ), Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-9 (IBDQ-9), and serum level of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC), respectively. Serum SOD (122.28 +/- 11.55 to 125.77 +/- 10.97) and TAC (9.87 +/- 1.51-11.97 +/- 1.61) increased, whereas serum MDA (5.62 +/- 1.18-3.42 +/- 1.01) decreased significantly in resveratrol group (p <0.001). Moreover, resveratrol supplementation significantly decreased disease activity and increased the quality of life (p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that 500 mg/day resveratrol supplementation can improve the disease activity and quality of life in patients with UC at least partially through reduction of oxidative stress. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dosage of supplementation for these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory disease in which reducing pro-inflammatory and/or increasing anti-inflammatory molecules is the mainstay of treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementation with resveratrol as an antiinflammatory and antioxidant agent on inflammation and quality of life in patients with active UC. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 50 eligible patients with active mild to moderate UC were supplemented with either a 500-mg resveratrol or placebo capsule for 6 weeks. Serum inflammatory markers, activity of NF-kappaB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and quality of life were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. Resveratrol supplementation led to a significant reduction in plasma levels of TNF-alpha (19.70 +/- 12.80 to 17.20 +/- 10.09 pg/mL) and hs-CRP (4764.25 +/- 2260.48 to 2584.50 +/- 1792.80 ng/mL) and activity of NF-kappaB in PBMCs (0.19 +/- 0.05 to 0.10 +/- 0.04 OD) (p <0.001), whereas there were no significant changes of these factors in placebo group. Also, the score of inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire -9 (IBDQ-9) increased, whereas the clinical colitis activity index score decreased significantly in the resveratrol group (32.72 +/- 7.52 to 47.64 +/- 8.59) (p <0.001) and when compared with the placebo group (35.54 +/- 9.50 to 41.08 +/- 6.59) (p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that 6 weeks supplementation with 500 mg resveratrol can improve quality of life and disease clinical colitis activity at least partially through inflammation reduction in patients with UC. Whether these effects will be continued in longer duration of treatment remains to be determined.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Fiber definition includes all those carbohydrates which are not digested nor absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract allowing them to reach the colon with no previous processing. Traditionally fiber has been classified according to their solubility into soluble and insoluble and different physiological properties have been defined for each type. The physiologic role of the fiber intake has been studied in diabetes, dyslipidemia or obesity. Fiber intake has also demonstrated to be beneficial in the prevention of many neoplastic diseases like colorectal cancer. It s also known that fiber plays an important role in the faecal excretion of nitrogen. AIM: To evaluate the current evidence that fiber intake plays in the management and prevention of several different diseases, being able to determine, if possible, the most recommended fiber type for each clinical condition. METHODS: A non-systematic review by searching the Medline and Pubmed was made and studies which met the inclusion criteria were identified and selected for analysis. RESULTS: Different fiber types can be useful for the treatment of several gastrointestinal diseases like constipation, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis remission or short bowel syndrome. Patients diagnosed with diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and other cardiometabolic diseases can get a clinical improvement with soluble fiber intake. Dietary fiber has demonstrated to play a role in the prevention of colorrectal cancer and other neoplastic diseases. Patients with hepatic encephalopathy or chronic kidney disease will also benefit from fermentable fiber intake. DISCUSSION: Fiber plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of many clinical conditions. However further investigations are needed to establish specific fiber intake recommendations.},

   abstract = {Hydroxytyrosol, a polyphenolic compound from extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has exhibited an improvement in a model of DSS-induced colitis. However, other phenolic compounds present such as hydroxytyrosyl acetate (HTy-Ac) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) need to be explored to complete the understanding of the overall effects of EVOO on inflammatory colon mucosa. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of both HTy-Ac and DHPG dietary supplementation in the inflammatory response associated to colitis model. Six-week-old mice were randomized in four dietary groups: sham and control groups received standard diet, and other two groups were fed with HTy-Ac and DHPG, respectively, at 0.1%. After 30 days, all groups except sham received 3% DSS in drinking water for 5 days followed by a regime of 5 days of water. Acute inflammation was evaluated by Disease Activity Index (DAI), histology and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Colonic expression of iNOS, COX-2, MAPKs, NF-kB and FOXP3 were determined by western blotting. Only HTy-Ac-supplemented group showed a significant DAI reduction as well as an improvement of histological damage and MPO. COX-2 and iNOS protein expression were also significantly reduced. In addition, this dietary group down-regulated JNK phosphorylation and prevented the DSS-induced nuclear translocation level of p65. However, no significant differences were observed in the FOXP3 expression. These results demonstrated, for the first time, that HTy-Ac exerts an antiinflammatory effect on acute ulcerative colitis. We concluded that HTy-Ac supplement might provide a basis for developing a new dietary strategy for the prevention of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: Squalene is a polyunsaturated triterpene, which has exhibited anticancer and antioxidant activities among others. We investigated dietary squalene supplementation effect on an acute colitis model induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in C57BL/6 mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice were fed from weaning with squalene at 0.02% and 0.1%. After 4 weeks, mice were exposed to 3% DSS for 5 days developing acute colitis. After DSS removal (5 days), colons were histological and biochemically processed. Our results showed that dietary squalene treatment exerts anti-inflammatory action in DSS-induced acute colitis. Western blot revealed that squalene downregulated COX-2 (where COX is cyclooxygenase) and inducible nitric oxide synthase system by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways, preventing an increase in the cytokines levels. Under our experimental conditions, STAT3 and FOXP3 (where FOXP3 is forkhead box P3) were not modified and the transcriptional regulation of antioxidant and/or detoxifying enzymes, Nrf2 (where Nrf2 is nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2), was reduced in DSS-induced colitis. However, any change could be observed after squalene supplementation. CONCLUSION: Squalene was able to improve the oxidative events and returned proinflammatory proteins expression to basal levels probably through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways. However, supplementary studies are needed in order to provide a basis for developing a new dietary supplementation strategy.},

Currently there is no cure for IBD, thus the search for new molecules capable of controlling IBD and their delivery to the site of inflammation are the goal of many researchers. The aim of this work was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of the administration of milks fermented by a Lactococcus (L.) lactis strain producing 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) using a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced IBD mouse model. The results obtained demonstrated that 15-LOX-1 producing L. lactis was effective in the prevention of the intestinal damage associated to inflammatory bowel disease in a murine model. The work also confirmed previous studies showing that fermented milk is an effective form of administration of recombinant lactic acid bacteria expressing beneficial molecules.},

   abstract = {AIM: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two important chronic Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) characterized by prominent intestinal inflammation. Probiotics are the bacteria that promote the host health by its immunomodulatory activity. The present study investigated the correlation between in vitro adhesion and immunomodulatory properties, and to assess the therapeutic potential of Bifidobacterium bifidum 231 (BIF 231), a new strain of probiotic in ulcerative colitis in rats. METHODS: In vitro adhesion assays and immunomodulatory effect of BIF 231 on interleukins (IL-1beta and IL-10) in IEC-6 cell lines were quantified by gram staining, scanning electron microscopy and q-PCR respectively. Colitis was induced by intra-rectal instillation of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. Colitis was evaluated by alterations in colon gross morphology, histologically and biochemically. Colonic interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA and protein expression were assessed by q-PCR, ELISA and western blot. RESULTS: BIF 231 showed better adhesion and immunomodulation by up-regulating IL-10 levels in IEC-6 cell lines. In vivo studies with treatment of BIF 231 (1.4x1011 CFU/rat/day) revealed anti-inflammatory effects both macroscopically and histologically. BIF 231 lowered TBARS, nitric oxide and augmented GSH levels. BIF 231 treatment to colitic rats down regulated IL-1beta levels with concurrent increase in IL-10 levels. CONCLUSIONS: BIF 231 exerted beneficial in vitro adhesion and immunomodulatory properties which facilitated the recovery of the damaged tissue in TNBS-induced colitis.},

The present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum 21 (LAB 21) on inflammatory mediators in trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats. The inflammatory response was assessed by changes in colon morphology, histopathology, and measurement of reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (TBARS), nitric oxide (NO), interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 10 (IL-10) mRNA and protein levels by ELISA. Besides, protein expressions of IL-1beta and IL-10 were also evaluated by western blot. Treatment with LAB 21 (1x10(10)CFU/rat/day) and sulfasalazine (500mgkg(-1) body weight) for 14days after induction of colitis, significantly decreased TBARS, NO and increased GSH concentration. The protein and mRNA expressions of IL-1beta and TNFalpha were down-regulated, whereas, protein and mRNA expression of IL-10 was up-regulated in LAB 21-treated rats. Moreover, LAB 21 attenuated the macroscopic colonic damage, histopathological changes induced by TNBS. These results suggest that LAB 21 may be effective in the treatment of UC by immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic debilitating disorders of unknown etiology, consisting of two main conditions, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Major advances have recently taken place in human genetic studies of IBD and over 160 risk loci for these two diseases have been uncovered. These genetic data highlight a key role for genes that code for immunological and epithelial barrier functions. Environmental factors also make substantial contributions to the pathogenesis of IBD and account for the growing incidence of the diseases around the world. Intestinal microbiota creates resistance to infection, provides nutrients, and educates the immune system and in many ways has a significant impact on human health. Aberrant microbiota composition and decreased diversity (dysbiotic microbiota) are key etiopathological events in IBD. Dysbiotic microbiota can lead to loss of normal, regulatory immune effects in the gut mucosa. This may play a central role in the development and perpetuation of chronic inflammation. Further, the expression of specific innate immune receptors that recognize microbes is altered in the IBD epithelium. Therefore, the combination of host side epithelial barrier functions and the presence of dysbiotic microbiota in the gut together promote inflammation. New therapeutic options targeting microbiota are currently considered for IBD and they may, in the future, provide means to reverse the pathogenic host-microbiota relationship into a symbiotic one. In this review, the focus is on the intestinal microbiota and host-microbe interactions in IBD.},

In this study we analyzed the pharmacokinetic profile of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as the free fatty acid (FFA), in an enteric-coated preparation, in 10 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 10 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 15 healthy volunteers (HV). Subjects received 2 g daily of EPA-FFA for 8 weeks. Plasma phospholipid and red blood cell (RBC) membrane fatty acid content were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. There was a rapid incorporation of EPA into plasma phospholipids by 2 weeks and a slower, but highly consistent, incorporation into RBC membranes (4% total fatty acid content; coefficient of variation 10-16%). There was a concomitant reduction in relative n-6 PUFA content. Elongation and desaturation of EPA into docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) via docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) were apparent and DHA content also increased in membranes. EPA-FFA is well tolerated and no difference in the pharmacokinetic profile of n-3 PUFA incorporation was detected between IBD patients and HV. Our data support the concept that EPA can be considered the "universal donor" with respect to key n-3 PUFAs and that this enteric-coated formulation allows long term treatment with a high level of compliance.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease, whose etiology is still unclear. Its pathogenesis involves an interaction between genetic factors, immune response and the "forgotten organ", Gut Microbiota. Several studies have been conducted to assess the role of antibiotics and probiotics as additional or alternative therapies for Ulcerative Colitis. Escherichia coli Nissle (EcN) is a nonpathogenic Gram-negative strain isolated in 1917 by Alfred Nissle and it is the active component of microbial drug Mutaflor((R)) (Ardeypharm GmbH, Herdecke, Germany and EcN, Cadigroup, In Italy) used in many gastrointestinal disorder including diarrhea, uncomplicated diverticular disease and UC. It is the only probiotic recommended in ECCO guidelines as effective alternative to mesalazine in maintenance of remission in UC patients. In this review we propose an update on the role of EcN 1917 in maintenance of remission in UC patients, including data about efficacy and safety. Further studies may be helpful for this subject to further the full use of potential of EcN.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases are thought to develop as a result of dysregulation of the relationship that exists between the gut microbiota, host genetics and the immune system. The advent of culture-independent techniques has revolutionised the ability to characterise the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease based on the microbiota's genetic make-up. Inflammatory bowel diseases are characterised by dysbiosis which is an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory bacteria and a reduction in bacterial diversity. Emerging data suggest that it is not only the presence of the gut microbiota but the functional activity of the microbiota that appears to play an important role in health and disease. Current strategies to manipulate therapeutically the gut microbiota using dietary modification, prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation aim to restore the balance to a state of normobiosis. However, the ability of such strategies to correct dysbiosis and thereby achieve therapeutic benefit is yet to be fully characterised.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and unclassified IBD, continues to cause significant morbidity. While its incidence is increasing, no clear etiology and no cure have yet been discovered. Recent findings suggest that IBD may have a multifactorial etiology, where complex interactions between genetics, epigenetics, environmental factors (including diet but also infections, antibiotics, and sanitation), and host immune system lead to abnormal immune responses and chronic inflammation. Over the past years, the role of altered gut microbiota (in both composition and function) in IBD pathogenesis has emerged as an outstanding area of interest. According to new findings, gut dysbiosis may appear as a key element in initiation of inflammation in IBD and its complications. Moreover, complex metagenomic studies provide possibilities to distinguish between IBD types and appreciate severity and prognosis of the disease, as well as response to therapy. This review provides an updated knowledge of recent findings linking altered bacterial composition and functions, viruses, and fungi to IBD pathogenesis. It also highlights the complex genetic, epigenetic, immune, and microbial interactions in relation to environmental factors (including diet). We overview the actual options to manipulate the altered microbiota, such as modified diet, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal transplantation. Future possible therapies are also included. Targeting altered microbiota could be the next therapeutic personalized approach, but more research and well-designed comparative prospective studies are required to formulate adequate directions for prevention and therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an intestinal chronic inflammatory condition and includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). It has been proposed that Vitamin D supplementation may have a beneficial role in IBD. AIM: To characterize the effects of Vitamin D on cathelicidin (hCAP/LL37) gene expression, ESR, and serum hs-CRP levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety UC patients on remission were randomized to receive 300,000 IU intramuscular Vitamin D or 1 mL normal saline as placebo, respectively. Before and 90 days after intervention, serum levels of 25 (OH)-Vitamin D3, PTH, Calcium, ESR, and hs-CRP were measured. Cathelicidin gene expression was also quantified using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Baseline serum 25-OH-Vitamin D3 levels were not different between the two groups and after intervention, increased only in Vitamin D group (P < 0.001). Hs-CRP levels were lower in Vitamin D group after intervention (Before: 3.43 +/- 3.47 vs 3.86 +/- 3.55 mg/L, P = 0.56; after: 2.31 +/- 2.25 vs 3.90 +/- 3.97 mg/L, P= 0.023). ESR decreased significantly in Vitamin D group (Before: 12.4 +/- 6.1 vs 12.1 +/- 5.3 mm/h, P= 0.77; after: 6.7 +/- 4.5 vs 11.4 +/- 5.5 mm/h, P< 0.001). The mean fold change in hCAP18 gene expression in Vitamin D group was significantly higher than placebo group. (Mean +/- SD: 3.13 +/- 2.56 vs 1.09 +/- 0.56; median +/- interquartile range: 2.17 +/- 3.81 vs 0.87 +/- 0.53, P< 0.001). CONCLUSION: Decreases in ESR and hs-CRP levels and increase in LL37 gene expression support the hypothesis that Vitamin D supplementation may have a beneficial role in UC patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are some evidences for the immunomodulation disorders in the response to intestinal microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease. Yogurt is a fermented milk product made with a starter culture consisting of different probiotics which could be colonized in intestine. However, the role of probiotics in the aetiopathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) has not been clarified. To determine how the immune system responds to these bacteria this study was planned. METHODS: Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12 (B. lactis) and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 (L. acidophilus) were cultivated on MRS broth. PBMCs of 36 UC patients were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation and co-cultured with different concentrations of UV killed bacteria in RPMI-1 640 plus 10% FCS for 48/72 h. IL-10, TGF-beta, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were measured in supernatant of PBMCs by ELISA. RESULTS: Both bacteria significantly augmented IL-10, TGF-beta, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha compared to control (p<0.001). The secretion levels of IL-10 and TGF-beta by B. lactis- compared to L. acidophilus-stimulated PBMCs were significantly higher (p<0.05, p<0.01 respectively). The secretion levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma by PBMCs after 72 h were significantly lower compared to 48 h stimulation by B. lactis (p<0.001, p<0.035 respectively). CONCLUSION: These data show that both probiotics may trigger the pro- and anti-inflammatory immune response of UC patients. It seems that IL-10/TGF-beta uprising by B. lactis could be the reason of TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma reduction. Therefore albeit B. lactis still stimulates the effector Th cells but because of more stimulatory effect on Tregs, it could be a good potential therapeutic candidate for further investigation.},

   abstract = {This study investigated the preventive effects of vinegar and acetic acid (the active component of vinegar) on ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. Vinegar (5% v/v) or acetic acid (0.3% w/v) treatment significantly reduced the disease activity index and histopathological scores, attenuated body weight loss, and shortened the colon length in a murine experimental colitis model induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Further mechanistic analysis showed that vinegar inhibited inflammation through suppressing Th1 and Th17 responses, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and MAPK signaling activation. Vinegar also inhibited endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis in the colitis mouse model. Surprisingly, pretreatment with vinegar for 28 days before DSS induction increased levels of the commensal lactic acid-producing or acetic acid-producing bacteria, including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacteria, and Enterococcus faecalis, whereas decreased Escherichia coli levels were found in the feces of mice. These results suggest that vinegar supplementation might provide a new dietary strategy for the prevention of UC.},

The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of stoss therapy on vitamin D levels during a period of 6 months in children with IBD and vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/L). METHODS: A retrospective chart review was undertaken, focusing upon children managed in the IBD clinic at Sydney Children's Hospital between 2006 and 2010. Those with a 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) level <50 nmol/L and those who received stoss therapy were included in this study. RESULTS: A total of 76 children received stoss therapy. There was a significant and sustained increase in 25-OHD levels at all of the time points compared with baseline (40.8 +/- 7.5 nmol/L), 1 month (145.6 +/- 51.8 nmol/L), 3 months (87.1 +/- 28.4 nmol/L), and 6 months 69.2 +/- 31.3 nmol/L). There were no significant changes in serum calcium, phosphate, or parathyroid hormone at any time points. CONCLUSIONS: Stoss therapy safely and effectively achieved and maintained a level of 25-OHD >50 nmol/L during 6 months in these children with IBD. Further prospective studies are now required to confirm this finding and establish whether this intervention has other benefits.},

   abstract = {To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of beta-glucans from Lentinus edodes, and its molecular mechanism, the dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) induced colitis model of mice and the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cell inflammation model were used in this study. 40 ICR male mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: Control, DSS (DSS treated only), DSS + low-betaGs (500 mg kg-1 d-1) and DSS + high-betaGs (1000 mg kg-1 d-1). The body weight of the mice with Lentinus edodes beta-glucan supplementation increased significantly compared to the DSS group and the disease activity index (DAI) was improved in both betaG-treated groups. Compared with the DSS group, histopathological analysis showed that the infiltration of inflammatory cells of both betaG-treated groups decreased significantly in colonic tissues. Furthermore, oral administration of beta-glucans decreases the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) and inhibits the expression of iNOS and several inflammatory factors: TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 as well as nitric oxide (NO) of the colonic tissues. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is closely related to the expression of pro-inflammatory factors. In the DSS-induced colitis model and the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cell model, betaGs inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory factors and blocked the phosphorylation of JNK/ERK1/2 and p38; betaGs also suppress the phosphorylation of Elk-1 at Ser84 and the phosphorylation of PPARgamma at Ser112. Altogether, these results suggest that Lentinus edodes betaGs could inhibit the DSS-induced ulcerative colitis and decrease inflammatory factor expressions. The molecular mechanism may be involved in suppressing MAPK signaling and inactivation of Elk-1 and activation of PPARgamma.},

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of natural raw meal (NRM) on high-fat diet (HFD, 45%) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 2% w/v)-induced colitis in C57BL/6J mice. MATERIALS/METHODS: Body weight, colon length, and colon weight-to-length ratio, were measured directly. Serum levels of obesity-related biomarkers, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), insulin, leptin, and adiponectin were determined using commercial kits. Serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6 were detected using a commercial ELISA kit. Histological study was performed using a hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining assay. Colonic mRNA expressions of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were determined by RT-PCR assay. RESULTS: Body weight and obesity-related biomarkers (TG, TC, LDL, HDL, insulin, leptin, and adiponectin) were regulated and obesity was prevented in NRM treated mice. NRM significantly suppressed colon shortening and reduced colon weight-to-length ratio in HFD+DSS induced colitis in C57BL/6J mice (P < 0.05). Histological observations suggested that NRM reduced edema, mucosal damage, and the loss of crypts induced by HFD and DSS. In addition, NRM decreased the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 and inhibited the mRNA expressions of these cytokines, and iNOS and COX-2 in colon mucosa (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that NRM has an anti-inflammatory effect against HFD and DSS-induced colitis in mice, and that these effects are due to the amelioration of HFD and/or DSS-induced inflammatory reactions.},

In this case-control study conducted in Iran, we examined the ability of the dietary inflammatory index (DII) to predict UC. This study included 62 UC cases and 124 controls hospitalized for acute non-neoplastic diseases. The DII was computed based on dietary intake assessed by a previously validated food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and the DII was analyzed as both continuous and as tertiles. Energy was adjusted using the residual method. Subjects with higher DII scores (i.e., with a more pro-inflammatory diet) had a higher risk of UC, with the DII being used as both a continuous variable (OR(continuous) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-2.32; one unit increase corresponding to approximately 8% of its range in the current study) and as tertiles (OR(tertile3vstertile1) 2.58, 95% CI 1.03-6.48, P(trend)| = |0.04). These results indicate that a pro-inflammatory diet is associated with increased risk of UC.},

   abstract = {REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Acorn toxicity has been anecdotally reported to cause fatal colitis and colic in horses but reports in the scientific literature are sparse. OBJECTIVES: This study reports the diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and outcome of 9 cases with suspected acorn toxicity admitted to 2 referral hospitals. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Case records from 2004 to 2013 were reviewed. Horses were included in the study if they met 3 of 4 criteria: exposure to acorns; clinical and laboratory data suggesting alimentary or renal dysfunction; acorn husks in the faeces or gastrointestinal tract; and necropsy and histopathological findings consistent with acorn toxicity. Data collected included case history, clinical presentation, clinicopathological data, ultrasonographic findings, case progression, and necropsy and histopathological findings. RESULTS: Nine horses met the inclusion criteria. Five cases presenting with haemorrhagic diarrhoea deteriorated rapidly and were subjected to euthanasia or died. Four cases showed signs of colic with gas distension, displacement of the large colon and diarrhoea. Three of these (33%) survived with medical management, the fourth was subjected to euthanasia. Post mortem examination of 6 cases demonstrated submucosal oedema of the large intestine and caecum (n = 6), acute tubular nephrosis (n = 6), diffuse necrohaemorrhagic and ulcerative typhlocolitis and enteritis (n = 4), and small intestinal oedema (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Acorn ingestion may be associated with typhylocolitis leading to diarrhoea, colic and acute renal tubular nephrosis. Recovery is possible in mildly affected cases; more severe cases show hypovolaemia, intractable pain, renal dysfunction and cardiovascular failure, and often succumb to the disease process. Disease is only seen in a small proportion of the population exposed to acorns and there seems to be an increased occurrence in certain years. Further investigation into factors predisposing to disease is required, but limiting exposure to acorns in the autumn seems prudent.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are a group of inflammatory conditions of the gut that include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Probiotics are live micro-organisms that may be used as adjuvant therapy for patients with IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of prophylactic ingestion of Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) in a murine model of colitis. For induction of colitis, mice were given a 3.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) solution for 7 days in drinking water. EcN administration to mice subjected to DSS-induced colitis resulted in significant reduction in clinical and histopathological signs of disease and preservation of intestinal permeability. We observed reduced inflammation, as assessed by reduced levels of neutrophils, eosinophils, chemokines and cytokines. We observed an increase in the number of regulatory T-cells in Peyer's patches. Germ-free mice received faecal content from control or EcN-treated mice and were then subjected to DSS-induced colitis. We observed protection from colitis in animals that were colonized with faecal content from EcN-treated mice. These results suggest that preventative oral administration of EcN or faecal microbiota transplantation with EcN-containing microbiota ameliorates DSS-induced colitis by modifying inflammatory responsiveness to DSS.},

CO has been recognized as potential new therapeutic agent for motility related and inflammatory disorders of the GI tract. A therapeutic use, however, is challenged by inappropriate drug delivery modes. Here we describe a micro scale Oral Carbon Monoxide Release System (M-OCORS) designed for localized and controlled exposure of the GI tract with in situ generated CO. M-OCORS allowed for controlled release profiles lasting for several minutes or up to almost one day. These in vitro release profiles translated into a large pharmacokinetic design space following oral administration in mice and measured as CO-hemoglobin (CO-Hb) formation. M-OCORS with a release profile featuring exposure of the intestine was profiled in two independently performed studies demonstrating preventive effects in chemically induced colitis. M-OCORS significantly reduced damage scores and prevented upregulation of colitis biomarkers.},

   abstract = {Bifidobacteria have been reported to reduce inflammation and contribute to intestinal homeostasis. However, the interaction between these bacteria and the gut immune system remains largely unknown. Because of the central role played by dendritic cells (DCs) in immune responses, we examined in vitro the effects of a Bifidobacteria mixture (probiotic) on DC functionality from children with inflammatory bowel disease. DCs obtained from peripheral blood monocytes of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis, and noninflammatory bowel disease controls (HC) were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated particles of Escherichia coli or DQ-Ovalbumin (DQ-OVA) after a pretreatment with the probiotic, to evaluate DC phenotype, antigen sampling and processing. Moreover, cell supernatants were collected to measure tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin 17, and interleukin 10 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. DCs from CD children showed a higher bacteria particles uptake and DQ-OVA processing after incubation with the probiotic; in contrast, DC from both ulcerative colitis and HC showed no significant changes. Moreover, a marked tumor necrosis factor alpha release was observed in DC from CD after exposure to E. coli particles, whereas the probiotic did not affect the production of this proinflammatory cytokine. In conclusion, the Bifidobacteria significantly improved the antigen uptake and processing by DCs from patients with CD, which are known to present an impaired autophagic functionality, whereas, in DCs from ulcerative colitis and HC, no prominent effect of probiotic mixture was observed. This improvement of antigen sampling and processing could partially solve the impairment of intestinal innate immunity and reduce uncontrolled microorganism growth in the intestine of children with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) is a pathological condition defined by the development of colon cancer in patients afflicted by Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC), two idiopathic diseases of the gut which together comprise the disease group called inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). When IBD involves the colon, affected patients face an increased risk of developing colon cancer compared to the general population. The phenomenon of CAC represents one of the most convincing forms of evidence linking the processes of inflammation, oxidative stress and carcinogenesis. A greater understanding of the molecular events driving CAC could reveal new strategies to treat IBD and reduce the incidence of CAC. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid produced through degradation of endogenous and dietary mammalian sphingolipids containing the long chain base sphingosine. S1P signals through a family of five G protein-coupled receptors. In addition, it activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), two transcriptional regulators that serve as master switches in inflammation and carcinogenesis. Through these and other mechanisms, a causal role for S1P in inflammatory conditions including colitis and CAC has been implicated. In contrast to S1P, dietary sphingolipids called sphingadienes derived from plant food sources cannot be converted to S1P and exhibit anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive activities, reducing colitis and CAC in mouse models. In this review, we summarize recent findings implicating S1P signaling and metabolism in the pathogenesis of IBD and CAC. The potential role of oxidative stress in modulating S1P is also discussed. Further, we propose the hypothesis that dietary sphingolipids may promote or prevent CAC depending on their ability to be converted to S1P.},

   abstract = {Recently, numerous studies have shown that disruption of the mucus barrier plays an important role in the exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly in ulcerative colitis. Alterations in the mucus barrier are well supported by published data and are widely accepted. The use of fluorescence in situ hybridization and Carnoy's fixation has revealed the importance of the mucus barrier in maintaining a mutualistic relationship between host and bacteria. Studies have raised the possibility that modulation of the mucus barrier may provide therapies for the disease, using agents such as short-chain fatty acids, prebiotics and probiotics. This review describes changes in the mucus barrier of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in animal models of the disease. We also review the involvement of the mucus barrier in the exacerbation of the disease and explore the therapeutic potential of modifying the mucus barrier with short-chain fatty acids, prebiotics, probiotics, fatty acid synthase, H(2)S, neutrophil elastase inhibitor and phophatidyl choline.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory disease of the large intestine, is characterized by a dysregulated immune reaction. UC is associated with fecal dysbiosis. Human and animal studies support the fact that the gastrointestinal microbiome may trigger the intestinal immune response, resulting in UC. Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT), by changing the gastrointestinal microbiome of patients with UC, may be a therapeutic option. METHODS: Four patients with moderate symptoms defined by the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index were enrolled in a prospective, open-label study of FMT via nasogastric tube in pediatric UC (US Food and Drug Administration IND 14942). After the donor and patient evaluation, patients received FMT with follow-up evaluations at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after transplantation. Study subjects were maintained on their pretransplant medications. The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index score, C-reactive protein, and stool calprotectin were completed during each study visit. RESULTS: Four patients with UC were enrolled (all boys). Ages ranged from 13 to 16 years. Patients tolerated FMT without adverse effects. None of the patients clinically improved with FMT, nor were there any significant changes in stool calprotectin or laboratory values, including C-reactive protein, albumin, and hematocrit. Three individuals received additional standard medical therapies before the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: This study, although showing that single-dose FMT via nasogastric tube is well tolerated in active pediatric UC, did not show any clinical or laboratory benefit.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the most severe complication in inflammatory bowel disease. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the probiotic VSL#3 when administered as either preventive or concurrent treatment in the progression from chronic colitis to colon cancer. METHODS: Mice were exposed to 5, 10, and 15 cycles of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS); each cycle consisted of 0.7% DSS for 1 week followed by distilled water for 10 days. VSL#3 was administered either from 2 weeks before the colitis induction or from the first day of the colitis until being killed. After each period, macroscopic and histological studies, as well as analysis of inflammatory and tumor biomarkers, were performed. RESULTS: Prophylactic or concurrent VSL#3 administration attenuated the disease activity index score and colon inflammation after 5, 10, and 15 cycles of DSS, as well as reduced the histological alterations and the incidence of colonic dysplastic lesions at the 3 periods studied. None of the animals receiving VSL#3 as a concurrent treatment developed carcinoma, which is in contrast to 5% and 20% of the mice following preventive VSL#3 administration, developing carcinoma at the 10th and the 15th cycles of DSS, respectively. In addition, the probiotic reduced the proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling index, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6 production, cyclooxygenase-2 expression, and increased interleukin-10 levels in colon tissue at the 3 periods assayed. CONCLUSIONS: VSL#3 administration reduced chronic inflammation and prevented or delayed the development of dysplasia and carcinoma in a mouse model of chronic colitis-associated cancer.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of Bifidobacterium longum 536 (BB536) supplementation for induction of remission in Japanese patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Fifty-six patients with mild to moderate UC were enrolled. Three patients had pancolitis, 36 had left-sided colitis, and 17 had proctitis. Patients were randomly treated with 2-3 x 10(11) freeze-dried viable BB536 (28 patients) or placebo (28 patients) for 8 weeks. RESULTS: In total, 63% of patients receiving BB536 showed clinical remission (UC disease activity index [UCDAI] </=2) at week 8 compared to 52% of those receiving placebo (P = 0.395). We observed a significant decrease of UCDAI scores (3.8 +/- 0.4 at baseline to 2.6 +/- 0.4 at week 8) in the BB536 group (P < 0.01), whereas there was no significant decrease in the placebo group (P = 0.88). There was also a significant decrease in the Rachmilewitz endoscopic index (EI) and the Mayo subscore at week 8 in the BB536 group, whereas there was no significant decrease in the placebo group. A single patient in the BB536 group complained of a mild side-effect, but no other adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with BB536 was well tolerated and reduced UCDAI scores, EI and Mayo subscores after 8 weeks in Japanese patients with mild to moderately active UC.},

Two presentations explored different aspects of probiotic intervention: the small intestine as a probiotic target and inclusion of probiotics into integrative approaches to gastroenterology. Probiotic recommendations in gastroenterology guidelines and current data on probiotic efficacy in paediatric patients were reviewed. Updates were given on probiotic and gut microbiota research in obesity and obesity-related diseases, the gut-brain axis and development of psychobiotics, and the protective effects of equol-producing strains for prostate cancer. Recent studies were presented on probiotic benefit for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and people with HIV, as well as protection against the adverse effects of a short-term high-fat diet. Aspects of probiotic mechanisms of activity were discussed, including immunomodulatory mechanisms and metabolite effects, the anti-inflammatory properties of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the relationship between periodontitis, microbial production of butyrate in the oral cavity and ageing, and the pathogenic mechanisms of Campylobacter. Finally, an insight was given on a recent expert meeting, which re-examined the probiotic definition, advised on the appropriate use and scope of the term and outlined different probiotic categories and the prevalence of different mechanisms of activity.},

   abstract = {In the present study, the protective potential of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain UFMG A-905 was evaluated in a murine model of acute ulcerative colitis (UC). Six groups of Balb/c mice were used: not treated with yeast and not challenged with dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) (control); treated with S. cerevisiae UFMG A-905 (905); treated with the non-probiotic S. cerevisiae W303 (W303); challenged with DSS (DSS); treated with S. cerevisiae UFMG A-905 and challenged with DSS (905 + DSS); and treated with S. cerevisiae W303 and challenged with DSS (W303 + DSS). Seven days after induction of UC, mice were euthanised to remove colon for enzymatic, immunological, and histopathological analysis. In vivo intestinal permeability was also evaluated. An improvement of clinical manifestations of experimental UC was observed only in mice of the 905 + DSS group when compared to animals from DSS and W303 + DSS groups. This observation was confirmed by histological and morphometrical data and determination of myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase activities, intestinal permeability and some pro-inflammatory cytokines. S. cerevisiae UFMG A-905 showed to be a potential alternative treatment for UC when used in an experimental animal model of the disease.},

   abstract = {The human body is colonized by a large number of microbes that are collectively referred to as the microbiota. They interact with the hosting organism and some do contribute to the physiological maintenance of the general good health thru regulation of some metabolic processes while some others are essential for the synthesis of vitamins and short-chain fatty acids. The abnormal variation, in the quality and/or quantity of individual bacterial species residing in the gastro-intestinal tract, is called dysmicrobism. The immune system of the host will respond to these changes at the intestinal mucosa level which could lead to Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). This inflammatory immune response could subsequently extend to other organs and systems outside the digestive tract such as the thyroid, culminating in thyroiditis. The goal of the present study is to review and analyze data reported in the literature about thyroiditis associated with inflammatory bowel diseases such as Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohns Disease (CD). It was reported that similarities of some molecular bacterial components with molecular components of the host are considered among the factors causing IBD through an autoimmune reaction which could involve other non-immune cell types. The axis dysmicrobism-IBD-autoimmune reaction will be investigated as a possible etiopathogenic mechanism to Autoimmune Thyroiditis. If such is the case, then the employment of specific probiotic strains may represent a useful approach to moderate the immune system.},

The aim of this study was to review the available literature on the efficacy of herbal therapy in experimental colitis. All relevant studies published in Medline and Embase up to June 2015 have been reviewed. The results of bowel histology and serum parameters have been recorded. A satisfactory number of published experimental studies, and a quite large one of both herbal and plant products tested in different studies have been reported. The results showed that in the majority of the studies, herbal therapy reduced the inflammatory activity of experimental colitis and diminished the levels of many inflammatory indices, including serum cytokines and indices of oxidative stress. The most promising plant and herbal products were tormentil extracts, wormwoodherb, Aloe vera, germinated barley foodstuff, curcumin, Boswellia serrata, Panax notoginseng, Ixeris dentata, green tea, Cordia dichotoma, Plantago lanceolata, Iridoidglycosides, and mastic gum. Herbal therapies exert their therapeutic benefit via various mechanisms, including immune regulation, anti-oxidant activity, inhibition of leukotriene B4 and nuclear factor-kappaB, and antiplatelet activity. Large, double-blind clinical studies assessing these natural substances should be urgently conducted.},

   abstract = {The use of herbal therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing worldwide. The aim of this study was to review the literature on the efficacy of herbal therapy in IBD patients. Studies on herbal therapy for IBD published in Medline and Embase were reviewed, and response to treatment and remission rates were recorded. Although the number of the relevant clinical studies is relatively small, it can be assumed that the efficacy of herbal therapies in IBD is promising. The most important clinical trials conducted so far refer to the use of mastic gum, tormentil extracts, wormwood herb, aloe vera, triticum aestivum, germinated barley foodstuff, and boswellia serrata. In ulcerative colitis, aloe vera gel, triticum aestivum, andrographis paniculata extract and topical Xilei-san were superior to placebo in inducing remission or clinical response, and curcumin was superior to placebo in maintaining remission; boswellia serrata gum resin and plantago ovata seeds were as effective as mesalazine, whereas oenothera biennis had similar relapse rates as omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. In Crohn's disease, mastic gum, Artemisia absinthium, and Tripterygium wilfordii were superior to placebo in inducing remission and preventing clinical postoperative recurrence, respectively. Herbal therapies exert their therapeutic benefit by different mechanisms including immune regulation, antioxidant activity, inhibition of leukotriene B4 and nuclear factor-kappa B, and antiplatelet activity. Large, double-blind clinical studies assessing the most commonly used natural substances should urgently be conducted.},

Mucosal inflammation, due to altered microbiota, increased intestinal permeability and immune system dysfunction underlies the symptoms and may be caused in susceptible individuals by different factors (or a combination of them), including dietary habits and components. In this review we describe the influence of the Western diet, obesity, and different nutraceuticals/functional foods (bioactive peptides, phytochemicals, omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D, probiotics and prebiotics) on the course of IBD, and provide some hints that could be useful for nutritional guidance. Hopefully, research will soon offer enough reliable data to slow down the spread of the disease and to make diet a cornerstone in IBD therapy.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are multifactorial, relapsing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. However, the etiology is still poorly understood but involves altered immune responses, epithelial dysfunction, environmental factors, and nutrition. Recently, we have shown that the diet supplement corabion has cardioprotective effects due to reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation. Since oxidative stress and inflammation are also prominent risk factors in IBD, we speculated that corabion also has beneficial effects on experimental colitis. Colitis was induced in male mice by administration of 3.5% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for a period of 3 or 7 days with or without daily gavage feeding of corabion consisting of vitamin C, vitamin E, L-arginine, and eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid. We found that corabion administration attenuated DSS-induced colon shortening, tissue damage, and disease activity index during the onset of colitis. Mechanistically, these effects could be explained by reduced neutrophil recruitment, oxidative stress, production of proinflammatory cytokines, and internalization of the junctional proteins ZO-1 and E-cadherin leading to less edema formation. Thus, corabion may be a useful diet supplement for the management of chronic inflammatory intestinal disorders such as IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to compare the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and worry of pediatric patients with functional GI disorders (FGIDs) and organic GI diseases to healthy controls utilizing the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales for patient self-reports ages 5-18 years and parent proxy-reports for ages 2-18 years. The secondary objective was to compare FGIDs and organic GI diseases to each other. METHODS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 587 pediatric patients with GI disorders and 685 parents of patients. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease). Ten Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring Stomach Pain, Stomach Discomfort When Eating, Food and Drink Limits, Trouble Swallowing, Heartburn and Reflux, Nausea and Vomiting, Gas and Bloating, Constipation, Blood, and Diarrhea were administered along with two Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. Five hundred and thirteen healthy children and 337 parents of healthy children completed the PedsQL Gastrointestinal Scales in an Internet panel survey. RESULTS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales distinguished between pediatric patients with FGIDs and organic GI diseases in comparison with healthy controls, supporting known-groups validity. Patients with FGIDs reported more GI symptoms and worry than patients with organic GI diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales may be utilized as common metrics across pediatric patient groups with FGIDs and organic GI diseases and healthy samples to measure GI-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice.},

The primary study objectives were to compare the gastrointestinal symptoms and worry of pediatric patients with IBD with matched healthy controls and to compare Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with each other using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. METHODS: PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 256 pediatric patients with IBD and 259 parents of patients (263 families; Crohn's disease [n = 195], ulcerative colitis [n = 68]). Ten Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea were administered along with 2 Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. A matched group of 384 healthy children families completed the PedsQL in an Internet survey. RESULTS: PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales distinguished between pediatric patients with IBD in comparison with healthy controls (P < 0.001), with larger effect sizes for symptoms indicative of IBD, supporting known-groups validity and clinical interpretability including minimal important difference scores. Patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis did not demonstrate significantly different gastrointestinal symptoms or worry in comparison with each other. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales may be used as common metrics across pediatric patients with IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis separately to measure gastrointestinal-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acetic acid ulcerative colitis (UC) is an experimental condition created due to intra-rectal administration of acetic acid which causes inflammation and ulceration in the lining of colon and rectum. In such condition, the colon cannot absorb liquid from the stools, resulting in larger volume of watery stools. Mesalazine is mainly used for the treatment of UC but suffers from the drawback of having poor bioavailability. UC is also characterized by alteration in colonic microflora. The present work was focused on delivering mesalazine along with probiotic, which would facilitate to refurbish customary growth of microflora. Mesalazine and probiotic were encapsulated in pectin beads with an aim to protect the drug from gastric environment and target to colonic region. METHODS: Pectin beads were prepared, formulation process was optimized for polymer concentration, drug concentration, cross-linking agent concentration. Formulation was characterized for surface morphology, in vitro drug release studies, determination of viable cell count, in vivo ulcer protective studies and stability studies. RESULTS: Average particle diameter of beads was approximately 1.44-1.72 mm. Drug entrapment efficiency was found to be optimal (78-79%). A sustained release of drug was observed for 5 h; nearly 60% of drug was released at the end of 10 h. Microbiological studies of probiotic showed best cell viability. In acetic acid induced UC model, Mesalazine-probiotic beads-treated group showed significant (p < 0.01) ulcer protection index with respect to free drug-treated group. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, mesalazine-probiotic loaded beads may serve as a useful colon specific drug delivery system for treatment of colitis.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Semen Crotonis Pulveratum (SCP) has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of UC. However, its molecular mechanisms of action have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the preliminary mechanisms of the role of SCP on trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced UC in rats and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced intestinal cell apoptosis in vitro. Wistar rats (n=9 per group) were randomly divided into 4 groups: the normal control group, the UC group, the UC + SCP group and the UC + sulfasalazine group as a positive control. The proportion of CD4+CD25+ T cells and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs, and the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 in the peripheral blood, as well as the expression levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in the colon tissues were determined by flow cytometry, ELISA and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. Rat intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cell apoptosis induced by H2O2 was determined by TUNEL assay, flow cytometry using Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and western blot analysis of caspase-3 activation, respectively. Significantly higher proportions of circulating CD4+CD25+ T cells and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs were present in the UC + SCP group compared with the UC group. A significantly decreased expression of IL-6 and an increased expression of IL-10 were also observed in the UC + SCP group compared with UC group. SCP significantly reduced the UC-induced increase in the expression of COX-2 and ICAM-1 in the colon tissues. SCP inhibited cell apoptosis and caspase-3 activation induced by H2O2 in the ICE-6 cells. Our data thus indicate that SCP inhibits inflammation in UC by increasing the proportion of circulating Tregs, altering cytokine production and decreasing COX-2 and ICAM-1 expression. In addition it protects against H2O2-induced intestinal cell apoptosis in vitro.},

   abstract = {To investigate the effect of huangqin tang on expression of cytokines and NF-kappaB p65 in rats with ulcerative colitis (UC), and to probe into its underlying mechanisms of action. The mode of UC rats with cell immunoreactivity was made using compound method (trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and ethanol). Rats were randomly divided into control group, model group, SASP group and high dose, middle dose and low dose of huangqin tang group. The food intake, body weight and microscopic damage of rats in each group were evaluated after being treated for five days. The blood and colon tissue were also collected. Production of NO was detected by Griess assay, the expression levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, PGE2 were detected by ELISA. ICH method was undertaken to determine the expression of NF-kappaB p65 protein in colon tissue. The food intake and body weight of model group rats were lower than that of control group. The expression levels of NO, IL-6, TNF-alpha, PGE2 in serum and NF-kappaB p65 protein of colon tissue in model group were higher than that of control group. The above indexes were ameliorated in high and middle dose of huangqin tang groups. But there was no significant difference with SASP group. NF-kappaB p65 may be involved in the pathogenesis of UC, and huangqin tang can inhibit the relative activity of NF-kappaB p65, and decrease the expression levels of NO, IL-6, TNF-alpha and PGE2.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of diseases characterized by inflammation of the small and large intestine and primarily includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Although the etiology of IBD is not fully understood, it is believed to result from the interaction of genetic, immunological, and environmental factors, including gut microbiota. Recent studies have shown a correlation between changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota and IBD. Moreover, it has been suggested that probiotics and prebiotics influence the balance of beneficial and detrimental bacterial species, and thereby determine homeostasis versus inflammatory conditions. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the understanding of the role of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in functions of the gastrointestinal tract and the induction and maintenance of IBD remission. We also discuss the role of psychobiotics, which constitute a novel class of psychotropic agents that affect the central nervous system by influencing gut microbiota.},

A previous report showed a weak association between TEN and acetaminophen. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration declared that acetaminophen is associated with a risk of serious skin reactions, including TEN. Here, we describe the case of a 43-year-old Japanese woman with TEN caused by acetaminophen. She had poorly controlled ulcerative colitis and was treated with high doses of prednisolone, infliximab, acetaminophen and lansoprazole. Nine days after administrating acetaminophen, targetoid erythematous and bullous lesions appeared on the patient's trunk, palms and the soles of her feet. The skin lesions expanded rapidly; within 3 weeks, skin detachment was detected across nearly 100% of the patient's body. However, no mucosal involvement of the eyes, oral cavity or genitalia was found. We performed lymphocyte transformation tests using various drugs; however, a high stimulation index was obtained only with acetaminophen. The patient recovered following treatment with plasmapheresis, i.v. immunoglobulin therapy, topical medication and supportive therapy. Acetaminophen is included in many prescription and over-the-counter products; thus, clinicians should monitor their patients for severe drug reactions, including TEN.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Malnutrition, protein-energy, and micronutrient deficiencies are common among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The deficiencies are a manifestation of the complicated disease and a cause of morbidity. The present review summarizes recent advances and evidence-based knowledge regarding micronutrients in relation to patients with IBD. RECENT FINDINGS: Micronutrient deficiencies occur in more than half of patients with IBD. Most common are deficiencies of iron, B12, vitamin D, vitamin K, folic acid, selenium, zinc, vitamin B6, and vitamin B1. Deficiencies are more common in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis, and more in active disease than at times of remission. Micronutrient deficiency is associated with prolonged and complicated course of disease. Iron deficiency is the most common cause for anemia. Definite diagnosis of B12 deficiency cannot be established by serum levels alone. Vitamin D and vitamin K deficiencies are thought to be associated with heightened inflammatory state. The relationship of these deficiencies with bone disease is controversial. The present review focuses on the significance, epidemiology, treatment options, and recommendations regarding micronutrient deficiencies in IBD. SUMMARY: Micronutrient deficiencies are common and have clinical significance. High suspicion for micronutrient deficiencies is advocated so that treatable causes of morbidity are treated appropriately and late and irreversible sequlae are prevented.},

Inflammation appears to be a major contributor in perpetuating a dysregulated gut microbiota. Although current drug therapies can significantly induce and maintain disease remission, there is no cure for these diseases. Nevertheless, ongoing human studies investigating dietary fibre interventions may potentially prove to exert beneficial outcomes for IBD. Postulated mechanisms include direct interactions with the gut mucosa through immunomodulation, or indirectly through the microbiome. Component species of the microbiome may degrade dietary-fibre polysaccharides and ferment the products to form short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate. Prebiotic dietary fibres may also act more directly by altering the composition of the microbiome. Longer term benefits in reducing the risk of more aggressive disease or colorectal cancer may require other dietary fibre sources such as wheat bran or psyllium. By critically examining clinical trials that have used dietary fibre supplements or dietary patterns containing specific types or amounts of dietary fibres, it may be possible to assess whether varying the intake of specific dietary fibres may offer an efficient treatment for IBD patients.},

   abstract = {Low expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and dysfunction of vitamin D/VDR signaling are reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); therefore, restoration of VDR function to control inflammation in IBD is desirable. Probiotics have been used in the treatment of IBD. However, the role of probiotics in the modulation of VDR signaling to effectively reduce inflammation is unknown. We identified a novel role of probiotics in activating VDR activity, thus inhibiting inflammation, using cell models and VDR knockout mice. We found that the probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (LGG) and Lactobacillus plantarum (LP) increased VDR protein expression in both mouse and human intestinal epithelial cells. Using the VDR luciferase reporter vector, we detected increased transcriptional activity of VDR after probiotic treatment. Probiotics increased the expression of the VDR target genes, such as antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, the role of probiotics in regulating VDR signaling was tested in vivo using a Salmonella-colitis model in VDR knockout mice. Probiotic treatment conferred physiological and histologic protection from Salmonella-induced colitis in VDR(+/+) mice, whereas probiotics had no effects in the VDR(-/-) mice. Probiotic treatment also enhanced numbers of Paneth cells, which secrete AMPs for host defense. These data indicate that the VDR pathway is required for probiotic protection in colitis. Understanding how probiotics enhance VDR signaling and inhibit inflammation will allow probiotics to be used effectively, resulting in innovative approaches to the prevention and treatment of chronic inflammation.},

   abstract = {Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a major pathogen for diarrhea in hospitalized patients and because of outbreak of highly virulent strain in EU and US, increased length of hospital stay and increased numbers of severe patients and deaths have become major challenges. In recent years, transmissions through community-acquired or food-borne infections are reported. National surveillance has been already performed overseas. Guidelines for preventing C. difficile infection (CDI) is available, and education activities are promoted for preventing the infection spread. Meanwhile, in Japan, medical hospitals are reporting individual CDI incidence, however, a large-scale research has not been conducted up to the present date and therefore the entire status of CDI including infection of the highly virulent strain has yet to be revealed. This time, we performed a questionnaire-based survey at 2,537 hospitals nationwide between April 15, 2013 and May 31, 2013 to investigate CDI incidence, diagnosis and treatment. Valid responses were obtained from 321 hospitals. Regarding the annual number of CDI patients at all the hospitals, the highest group of hospitals responding "1 to 5 patients a year" was 17.8%, and the second highest group of hospitals responding "no patients a year" was 13.1%. In contrast, there was a group of hospitals with "more than 101 patients a year", which was 3.1%. This indicates that there was the difference in the CDI incidences among hospitals. According to the questionnaire results, a highest group of hospitals responding "0-20%" for CDI patients with serious complication such as toxic megacolon, gastrointestinal perforation, ileus paralytic, bacteremia, sepsis, crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis was 62.6%, and for CDI patients with recurrence more than one, a group of hospitals answering "0 to 20%" was 56.4%, which was the highest. This suggested that there was only a small number of serious CDI patients and recurrence CDI patients in Japan. For rapid toxin detection kit used in CDI diagnosis, a group of hospitals using "C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETE" was over 40%, which showed that the kit was a major product used in Japan. And a group of institutions responding that they will start antibacterial medication such as vancomycin (VCM) and metronidazole (MNZ) as soon as after rapid diagnostic test, etc. showing positive results was over 70%. As for CDI treatment, a highest group of hospitals answering that VCM is administered orally at a dose of "0.5 g four times daily" was 42.1%, and a group of hospitals responding "10 to 14 days" for administration period was 44.2%, which was the highest. A highest group of hospitals answering that MNZ is administered orally at a dose of "250 mg four times daily" was 38.3%, and a group of hospitals responding "10 to 14 days" for administration period was 46.4%, which was the highest. Apart from VCM and MNZ, probiotics are also used for CDI treatment, "butyric acid bacterium" accounted for 40.8% in the probiotics group, which was the highest, followed by "bifidobacteria" 37.7% and "resistant lactic acid bacterium" 25.6%. To prevent the spread of CDI, 47.7% of the hospitals responded that the patients are "isolated", while 25.6% answered the patients are "sometimes isolated", which means that more than 70% of patients are "isolated or sometimes isolated". As to what type of antiseptic drug is used for sterilizing hospital, 68.2% of the hospitals answered that they are using "sodium hypochlorite 1,000 ppm". The survey more than 300 hospitals have revealed not only the CDI incidences, timing of toxin test, and part of the actual therapeutic strategy at medical institutions in Japan but also the difference in the CDI incidences and therapeutic strategy among hospitals. In the future, epidemiological data on epidemic strain will be accumulated more in Japan as are done overseas, and guidelines for CDI diagnosis and treatment will need to be formulated.},

Many studies showed that POL exhibited a wide range of pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory and liver complaints. In the clinical studies, POL was usually used for the treatment of UC disease and the clinical efficacy was well, but the mechanism and scientific intension was still unknown. In the present study, we studied the protective effects of the ethanol extract from POL on dextran sulphate sodium-induced UC in C57BL/6 mice model through oxidative stress and inflammatory pathway. The results demonstrated that the ethanol extract from POL could exhibit the effective protection for the DSS induced UC by increasing the colon length, decreasing body weight loss and the disease activity index score, inhibiting oxidative stress response through the MDA, NO, SOD activities, reducing the mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) and the protein expressions of TNF-alpha and NF-kB p65. These results may prove that POL could be considered as a useful and effective botanical compound from the edible plant to be used in UC through the oxidative stress and inflammatory activities.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Beneficial effects of carbohydrate fermentation on gastrointestinal health are well established. Conversely, protein fermentation generates harmful metabolites but their relevance to gastrointestinal health is poorly understood. AIM: To review the effects of increased protein fermentation on biomarkers of colonic health, factors influencing fermentative activity and potential for dietary modulation to minimise detrimental effects. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Medline, EMBASE and Google scholar for clinical and pre-clinical studies using search terms - 'dietary protein', 'fermentation', 'putrefaction', 'phenols', 'sulphide', 'branched-chain fatty acid', 'carbohydrate fermentation', 'gastrointestinal'. RESULTS: High protein, reduced carbohydrate diets alter the colonic microbiome, favouring a potentially pathogenic and pro-inflammatory microbiota profile, decreased short-chain fatty acid production and increased ammonia, phenols and hydrogen sulphide concentrations. These metabolites largely compromise the colonic epithelium structure, causing mucosal inflammation but may also directly modulate the enteric nervous system and intestinal motility. Increased protein fermentation as a result of a high-protein intake can be attenuated by addition of oligosaccharides, resistant starch and nonstarch polysaccharides and a reduction in total protein or specifically, aromatic and sulphur-containing amino acids. These factors may have clinical importance as novel therapeutic approaches to problems, in which protein fermentation may be implicated, such as malodorous flatus, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and prevention of colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The direct clinical relevance of excessive protein fermentation in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome, malodorous flatus and ulcerative colitis are underexplored. Manipulating dietary carbohydrate and protein intake have potential therapeutic applications in such settings and warrant further clinical studies.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing, and refractory disorder of the intestine. Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the preferred and standard surgical procedure for patients' refractory to medical therapy. Pouchitis is one of the most common long-term complications after IPAA. In the present study, the safety and efficacy of Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI (CBM) as a probiotic were examined. METHODS: A randomized and placebo-controlled study was performed. Seventeen patients were recruited from 2007 to 2013. Nine tablets of MIYA-BM((R)) or placebo were orally administered once daily. The cumulative pouchitis-free survival, pouch condition (using the modified pouch disease activity index), and blood parameters were evaluated. A fecal sample analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Subjects were randomly allocated to receive MIYA-BM or placebo (9 and 8 subjects, respectively). One subject in the MIYA-BM group and four subjects in the placebo group developed pouchitis. No side effects occurred in either group. Characteristic intestinal flora was observed in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that probiotic therapy with CBM achieved favorable results with minimal side effects and might be a useful complementary therapy for the prevention of pouchitis in patients with UC who have undergone IPAA.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of probiotic therapy for suppressing relapse in patients with inactive ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Bio-Three tablets, each containing 2 mg of lactomin (Streptococcus faecalis T-110), 10 mg of Clostridium butyricum TO-A, and 10 mg of Bacillus mesentericus TO-A, were used as probiotic therapy. Sixty outpatients with UC in remission were randomly assigned to receive 9 Bio-Three tablets/day (Bio-Three group) or 9 placebo tablets/day (placebo group) for 12 mo in addition to their ongoing medications. Clinical symptoms were evaluated monthly or on the exacerbation of symptoms or need for additional medication. Fecal samples were collected to analyze bacterial DNA at baseline and 3-mo intervals. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and cluster analyses were done to examine bacterial components of the fecal microflora. RESULTS: Forty-six patients, 23 in each group, completed the study, and 14 were excluded. The relapse rates in the Bio-Three and placebo groups were respectively 0.0% vs 17.4% at 3 mo (P = 0.036), 8.7% vs 26.1% at 6 mo (P = 0.119), and 21.7% vs 34.8% (P = 0.326) at 9 mo. At 12 mo, the remission rate was 69.5% in the Bio-Three group and 56.6% in the placebo group (P = 0.248). On cluster analysis of fecal flora, 7 patients belonged to cluster I, 32 to cluster II, and 7 to cluster III. CONCLUSION: Probiotics may be effective for maintaining clinical remission in patients with quiescent UC, especially those who belong to cluster I on fecal bacterial analysis.},

   abstract = {As an orally administered, locally acting gastrointestinal drug, mesalamine products are designed to achieve high local drug concentration in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to directly measure and compare drug dissolution of three mesalamine formulations in human GI tract and to correlate their GI concentration with drug concentration in plasma. Healthy human subjects were orally administered Pentasa, Apriso, or Lialda. GI fluids were aspirated from stomach, duodenum, proximal jejunum, mid jejunum, and distal jejunum regions. Mesalamine (5-ASA) and its primary metabolite acetyl-5-mesalamine (Ac-5-ASA) were measured using LC-MS/MS. GI tract pH was measured from each GI fluid sample, which averaged 1.82, 4.97, 5.67, 6.17, and 6.62 in the stomach, duodenum, proximal jejunum, middle jejunum, and distal jejunum, respectively. For Pentasa, high levels of 5-ASA in solution were observed in the stomach, duodenum, proximal jejunum, mid jejunum, and distal jejunum from 1 to 7 h. Apriso had minimal 5-ASA levels in stomach, low to medium levels of 5-ASA in duodenum and proximal jejunum from 4 to 7 h, and high levels of 5-ASA in distal jejunum from 3 to 7 h. In contrast, Lialda had minimal 5-ASA levels from stomach and early small intestine. A composite appearance rate (CAR) was calculated from the deconvolution of individual plasma concentration to reflect drug release, dissolution, transit, and absorption in the GI tract. Individuals dosed with Pentasa had high levels of CAR from 1 to 10 h; individuals dosed with Apriso had low levels of CAR from 1 to 4 h and high levels of CAR from 5 to 10 h; Lialda showed minimal levels of CAR from 0 to 5 h, then increased to medium levels from 5 to 12 h, and then decreased to further lower levels after 12 h. In the colon region, Pentasa and Apriso showed similar levels of accumulated 5-ASA excreted in the feces, while Lialda showed slightly higher 5-ASA accumulation in feces. However, all three formulations showed similar levels of metabolite Ac-5-ASA in the feces. These results provide direct measurement of drug dissolution in the GI tract, which can serve as a basis for investigation of bioequivalence for locally acting drug products.},

   abstract = {Diverse T help (Th) cells play a crucial role in the processing and maintaining of chronic inflammation as seen in ulcerative colitis (UC). Th9, a novel subset of Th cells that primarily produces interleukin (IL)-9, has recently been associated with the development of inflammatory diseases. In this study, we evaluated the presentation of Th9 cells in inflamed tissues of human and experimental mouse UC, and examined the therapeutic efficiency of anti Th9 cytokine IL-9 in the experimental mouse UC. Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), we evaluated the presentation of Th9 cells labelled by transcriptional factor PU.1 in both human and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced mouse colitis biopsies. The results showed that increased PU.1 positive Th9 cells were mainly located in the lamina propria in relative with the controls, intraepithelial Th9 cells can also be observed but at low density. Double IHCs revealed that most of PU.1 positive cells were CD3 positive lymphocytes in human UC specimens. Anti-IL-9 antibody injection for 2 weeks reduced the severity of inflammation in DSS induced colitis mice. Our results suggest that The Th9/IL-9 is involved in the pathogenesis of UC.},

   abstract = {Patients with inflammatory bowel disease often have extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) involving almost all organ systems, but little has been reported on Achilles tendinitis. Herein, we present a unique case of Achilles tendinitis, which manifested shortly after initiation of mesalazine therapy for ulcerative colitis. A 26-year-old Japanese woman with bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps lasting for 7 days was referred to our hospital. The Lichtiger clinical activity index (CAI) score was 9 at the first visit. Based on the clinical symptoms and examination results, she was diagnosed with ulcerative pancolitis in the active phase, and treatment with mesalazine (2.4 g/day) and probiotics was initiated. Her symptoms resolved within 7 days of treatment (CAI 3). However, she then developed bilateral Achilles tendinitis without any apparent cause. The Achilles tendinitis subsided with conservative management within 2 weeks, despite continuation of mesalazine therapy. This case instructively suggests that Achilles tendinitis should be noted as an EIM of ulcerative colitis.},

METHODS: The genetic polymorphisms of MIF -173G/C and GPX1 594C/T were determined with a polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-endonuclease method in peripheral blood leukocytes derived from 1500 UC cases and 1500 healthy controls. RESULTS: The frequencies of MIF -173CC and GPX1 594TT were 55.60% and 55.73% in the UC cases and 16.67% and 16.47% in the healthy controls, respectively. Statistical tests also showed a significant difference in the frequencies between the two groups (P<0.01; P<0.01, respectively). Individuals carrying MIF -173CC also had a significantly higher risk of UC compared with those with MIF -173GG (OR=6.8662, 95%CI: 4.5384-9.6158). Individuals carrying GPX1 594TT had a high risk of UC (OR=7.0854, 95%CI: 4.4702-10.5283). Combined analysis showed that the percentages of MIF -173CC/GPX1 594TT in the UC and control groups were 31.00% and 2.73%, respectively (P<0.01). Individuals carrying MIF -173CC/GPX1 594TT had a high risk of UC (OR=49.0113, 95%CI: 31.7364-61.8205). The high-fat diet rate of the case group was significantly higher than that of the control group (OR=3.3248, 95%CI: 1.9461-5.0193, P<0.01), and statistic analysis suggested an interaction between high-fat diet and MIF -173CC and GPX1 594TT which increase risk of UC (gamma =6.9293; gamma =6.9942). CONCLUSION: MIF -173CC and GPX1 594TT and high-fat diet are the risk factors for UC, and the significant interactions between genetic polymorphisms of MIF -173G/C, GPX1 594C/T and high-fat diet may increase the risk for UC.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most commonly ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Patients affected with IBD experience symptoms including abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and weight loss. There is no cure for IBD; thus treatments typically focus on preventing complications, inducing and maintaining remission, and improving quality of life. During IBD, dysregulation of the intestinal immune system leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, and recruitment of activated immune cells to the intestine, causing tissue damage and perpetuating the inflammatory response. Recent biological therapies targeting specific inflammatory cytokines or pathways, in particular TNF-alpha, have shown promise, but not all patients respond to treatment, and some individuals become intolerant to treatment over time. Dietary peptides and amino acids (AAs) have been shown to modulate intestinal immune functions and influence inflammatory responses, and may be useful as alternative or ancillary treatments in IBD. This review focuses on dietary interventions for IBD treatment, in particular the role of dietary peptides and AAs in reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the gut, as well as recent advances in the cellular mechanisms responsible for their anti-inflammatory activity.},

   abstract = {There is a clinical need for new, more effective treatments for chronic and debilitating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Targeting drugs selectively to the inflamed intestine may improve therapeutic outcomes and minimize systemic toxicity. We report the development of an inflammation-targeting hydrogel (IT-hydrogel) that acts as a drug delivery system to the inflamed colon. Hydrogel microfibers were generated from ascorbyl palmitate, an amphiphile that is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. IT-hydrogel microfibers loaded with the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid dexamethasone (Dex) were stable, released drug only upon enzymatic digestion, and demonstrated preferential adhesion to inflamed epithelial surfaces in vitro and in two mouse colitis models in vivo. Dex-loaded IT-hydrogel enemas, but not free Dex enemas, administered every other day to mice with colitis resulted in a significant reduction in inflammation and were associated with lower Dex peak serum concentrations and, thus, less systemic drug exposure. Ex vivo analysis of colon tissue samples from patients with ulcerative colitis demonstrated that IT-hydrogel microfibers adhered preferentially to mucosa from inflamed lesions compared with histologically normal sites. The IT-hydrogel drug delivery platform represents a promising approach for targeted enema-based therapies in patients with colonic IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy and safety of the application of enteral nutrition (EN) in gastrointestinal disease in children, and to explore the possibility of the implementation of family EN. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of disease spectrum, EN approach, preparation, speed and time as well as adverse reactions and outcomes in 47 pediatric patients with gastrointestinal disease underwent EN therapy during July 2014 to March 2015. The nutrition indicators before and after EN therapy were compared by paired t-test. RESULT: A total of 47 patients were selected, 27 male (57%) and 20 female (43%), aged 0.8 (0.3, 4.0) years, 9 with mechanical or chemical damage to the esophagus, 7 with inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), 6 with chronic diarrhea, 5 with acute pancreatitis, 3 with acute diarrhea and severe malnutrition, 3 with short bowel syndrome, 3 with improper feeding, 3 with feeding difficulties, 3 with protein losing enteropathy, 2 with post-enterostomy, 2 with enterocolitis, 1 with gastroesophageal reflux, were diagnosed. Of 47 cases, 22 were given oral nutrition, 28 were fed with nasogastric tube and 4 with nasojejunal tube feeding, 2 with percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy tube feeding for each. In these tube-feeding cases, 20 cases were treated with continuous infusion and 21 cases with intermittent infusion. Eleven cases were fed with amino acid formula; 21 cases took the choice of peptide formulations; 16 cases chose whole protein formula, including six cases who chose 3.3-4.2 kJ/ml higher energy density formula, 10 cases selected common energy density formula including breast milk. Twenty-one cases suffered from different degrees of adverse reactions, including vomiting in 7 cases, abdominal pain and bloating in 3, diarrhea in 12, secondary respiratory infections in 5. Five patients were discharged after giving up of treatment by parents due to poor efficacy on primary disease; 3 cases were transferred to other departments for further treatment; 15 cases were discharged with a feeding tube for family nutrition and specialist out-patient treatment. The rest 24 cases were all improved and discharged. There were significant differences in nutrition indicators before and after EN, weight-for-age Z score (WAZ)(-2.3+/-1.9 vs. -1.9+/-1.8, t=4.156, P=0.000), weight-for-height Z score (WHZ)(-1.9+/-1.7 vs. -1.2+/-1.5, t=3.714, P=0.001), albumin ((35+/-9)g/L vs.(39+/-6) g/L, t=3.017, P=0.005) and prealbumin ((0.11+/-0.05)g/L vs.(0.18+/-0.07)g/L, t=5.144, P=0.000). CONCLUSION: EN is suitable for a variety of children's digestive diseases, which can improve the nutritional status of the patients and was safe for clinical application. As the implementation of EN is simple and has good compliance, family EN is proven to be feasible.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and continuing colonic inflammation is considered an important risk factor in the development of colorectal cancer. Our previous studies showed that beetroot (Beta vulgaris var. rubra) products and their major component betanin modulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) stimulated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils of healthy volunteers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of betanin on the oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis in neutrophils isolated from blood of patients with inflammatory bowel disease--ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The results were compared with those obtained in colon carcinoma-derived Caco-2 cells. Betanin treatment at the concentration of 100 muM for 24 h increased DNA damage assessed by comet assay in IBD patients' neutrophils. A similar effect although less pronounced was observed in Caco-2 cells. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with H2O2 caused a 4-fold increase of DNA strand breaks in comparison to untreated cells, but pre-treatment with betanin reduced DNA damage in these cells. Betanin also induced procaspase-3 cleavage and caspase-3 activity accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, indicating its pro-apoptotic activity. These results suggest that betanin may support mechanisms that lead to the release of ROS and apoptotic cell death. In this way betanin may exert anti-inflammatory and potentially cancer preventive activity.},

   abstract = {Endocytosis is a fundamental cell biological process, which carries out essential functions in a polarized epithelial cell such as enterocytes provided with a huge surface area of the brush border membrane. Major tasks of enterocytes, which are regulated by endocytic signals, are digestion and absorption of nutrients and drugs/pharmacological agents, barrier permeability to microorganism, toxins and antigens, and transcytotic crosstalk between intestinal lumen and lamina propria cells with access to the circulation.Investigations on inflammatory bowel diseases such as food allergy, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis focus on immune processes originating within enterocytes as antigen presenting cells. Thus the initiation of oral tolerance, that is, the binding of food antigens to MHC class II proteins, might be localized within late endosomes of enterocytes. Furthermore, the late endosomal compartment of enterocytes seems to be involved in the processing of luminal antigens during the pathogenesis of celiac disease and inflammatory bowel diseases. Investigations of inherited diseases such as microvillus inclusion disease have revealed a pathogenetic defect in the autophagocytotic and/or recycling pathway of enterocytes.Our progress in the cell and molecular biological understanding of the endocytosis and the methodical opportunities of translational research offer now new therapeutic options for patients suffering from endocytosis-related diseases of enterocytes.},
