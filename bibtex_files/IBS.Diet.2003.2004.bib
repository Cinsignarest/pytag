Further, some cases of migraine appear to be linked to food intolerances as well. Now, a company in Florida has developed a DM program that can pinpoint specific cases of food intolerance and create an individualized program for eliminating symptoms.},

L-Tryptophan may represent a link between apparently disparate functional disorders and is of interest for general gastroenterologists, neurogastroenterologists, and neurologists. On the basis of estimates showing that approximately 20% of patients with functional bowel disorders seeking care in referral centres have psychiatric comorbidity, we attempt to provide a conceptual framework for defining the possible role of L-tryptophan in this population.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 53 patients with irritable bowel syndrome was enrolled in a non-propabilistic sample. Patients were diagnose with Roma II criteria. In all patients were determined, weight, height, body mass index, dietary intake of 3 days and a symptoms scoring system. RESULTS: The average age of 53 patients was 45.67+/-13.6 years with a distribution of sex (22 males/31 females). Caloric intakes was right in absolute terms and corrected by weight. Distribution of calories was 41.5% of carbohydrates, a 19.8% of proteins, and a 38.7% of lipids, showing a high intake of lipids and low of carbohydrates. A low intake of vitamin A and D was detected. High intake of vitamin B12, vitamin C and niacine was observed. A low intake of calcium, magnesium, yodo and zinc was detected. Intake of soluble fiber was lower than insoluble fiber (1.46+/-0.74 g/day) (19%) vs 6.21+/-2.67 g/day (71%). Intake of fiber corrected by calories was low 4.5+/-1.2 g/1000 calories. In correlation analysis, insoluble fiber (r=0.46; p < 0.05) and soluble fiber (r=0.42; p < 0.05) were inverse correlated with general symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome showed a deviation of mineral and vitamin dietary. Fiber intake is low, a correlation between fiber intake and general symptoms was detected.},

Fifty-six subjects with irritable bowel syndrome were prospectively and randomly assigned to one of two groups: group 1 received a diet containing 10.4 g/d of fiber and group 2 received a diet containing 30.5 g/d of fiber. Patients' body weights, nutritional intakes as assessed with 3-d written food records, and symptom scores were assessed at baseline and at 3 mo. RESULTS: There were no dropouts during the study. Total energy intake and the distribution of macronutrients were not significantly different between groups. Total dietary fiber intake did not reach recommended levels in either group but was higher in group 2 than in group 1 (25.95 +/- 2.12 g/d versus 6.06 +/- 2.7 g/d, P < 0.05). Initial fiber intake did not differ significantly between groups. Pain scores, bowel scores, and general scores improved in both groups (from baseline to 3 mo), and no significant differences were detected between groups. CONCLUSIONS: A modest fiber intake in patients with irritable bowel syndrome relieved symptoms, but this therapeutic benefit of fiber may have been due to a placebo effect because the results were similar in the low-fiber group.},

Tests attempting to predict food sensitivity in IBS have been disappointing but none has utilised IgG antibodies. AIMS: To assess the therapeutic potential of dietary elimination based on the presence of IgG antibodies to food. PATIENTS: A total of 150 outpatients with IBS were randomised to receive, for three months, either a diet excluding all foods to which they had raised IgG antibodies (enzyme linked immunosorbant assay test) or a sham diet excluding the same number of foods but not those to which they had antibodies. METHODS: Primary outcome measures were change in IBS symptom severity and global rating scores. Non-colonic symptomatology, quality of life, and anxiety/depression were secondary outcomes. Intention to treat analysis was undertaken using a generalised linear model. RESULTS: After 12 weeks, the true diet resulted in a 10% greater reduction in symptom score than the sham diet (mean difference 39 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 5-72); p = 0.024) with this value increasing to 26% in fully compliant patients (difference 98 (95% CI 52-144); p<0.001). Global rating also significantly improved in the true diet group as a whole (p = 0.048, NNT = 9) and even more in compliant patients (p = 0.006, NNT = 2.5). All other outcomes showed trends favouring the true diet. Relaxing the diet led to a 24% greater deterioration in symptoms in those on the true diet (difference 52 (95% CI 18-88); p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Food elimination based on IgG antibodies may be effective in reducing IBS symptoms and is worthy of further biomedical research.},

Patients with aerophagia and excessive eructation can be usually retrained to control air swallowing, but if present, basal dyspeptic symptoms may remain. Patients with excessive or odoriferous gas evacuation may benefit from a low-flatulogenic diet. In patients with gas retention due to impaired anal evacuation, anal incoordination can be resolved by biofeedback treatment, which also improves fecal retention, and thereby reduces the time for fermentation. Other patients complaining of abdominal symptoms that they attribute to intestinal gas, probably have irritable bowel syndrome or functional bloating, and their treatment options specifically targeting gas-related symptoms basically include prokinetics and spasmolytics. There is no consistent evidence to support the use of gas-reducing substances, such as charcoal or simethicone.},

OBJECTIVES: To compare patients' and GPs' views on the symptomatology, etiology and treatment of IBS. METHODS: One hundred forty-two IBS patients and 100 GPs were requested to complete a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: The response rates of the patients and GPs were 80% and 47%, respectively. Abdominal pain and bloating were considered to be the most bothersome symptoms in IBS, by both patients and GPs. Although all patients were diagnosed by their GP as having IBS, and 62% met the Manning criteria, only 18% fulfilled the Rome II criteria for IBS. Patients consider food intolerance and GPs regard lack of fibre as the main etiologic dietary factor. Many IBS patients expect a diagnostic work-up, but GPs generally restrict this to elderly patients. GPs start IBS management with dietary advice (94%), counselling (77%) and drug therapy (55%). Patients expect reassurance (47%) and drug treatment (37%), but dietary interventions are less appreciated (9%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients and GPs have different perceptions of the efficacy of diagnostic and dietary interventions in IBS. GPs should explore the patients expectations and incorporate these in their approach to IBS patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both high-fibre dietary advice and the prescription of fibre as a bulking agent are very common in primary and secondary care management of irritable bowel syndrome. Irritable bowel syndrome patients with constipation may have delayed intestinal transit. Therefore, fibres that accelerate intestinal transit may be beneficial in these patients. The uncertain benefits reported in several clinical studies, however, have led us to reappraise the value of fibre in irritable bowel syndrome management. AIM: To quantify the effect of different types of fibre on global and symptom relief from irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: Using a structured literature search in MEDLINE (1966-2002), we selected randomized controlled trials involving irritable bowel syndrome patients treated with fibre. Analyses were performed for the total group and for trials using soluble and insoluble fibre separately. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included in the analysis. None investigated primary care irritable bowel syndrome patients. Fibre, in general, was effective in the relief of global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms [relative risk, 1.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-1.50]. Irritable bowel syndrome patients with constipation may receive benefit from fibre treatment (relative risk, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.21-2.02), but there was no evidence that fibre was effective in the relief of abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome. Soluble and insoluble fibre, separately, had different effects on global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Soluble fibre (psyllium, ispaghula, calcium polycarbophil) showed significant improvement (relative risk, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.35-1.78), whereas insoluble fibre (corn, wheat bran), in some cases, worsened the clinical outcome, but there was no significant difference compared with placebo (relative risk, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of fibre in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome are marginal for global irritable bowel syndrome symptom improvement and irritable bowel syndrome-related constipation. Soluble and insoluble fibres have different effects on global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Indeed, in some cases, insoluble fibres may worsen the clinical outcome. Future clinical studies evaluating the effect and tolerability of fibre therapy are needed in primary care.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Psychological treatments are considered to be useful in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), although the evidence is based on small, often flawed trials. Although cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and relaxation therapy have both been promising, we hypothesized that CBT would be superior to relaxation and standard care alone in IBS patients. The objective of this study was to test this assumption by comparing the effects of cognitive behavior therapy with relaxation therapy and routine clinical care alone in individuals with IBS. METHODS: Patients (n = 105) with Rome I criteria for IBS were recruited from advertisement (n = 51) and outpatient clinics (n = 54); those patients with resistant IBS were not included. A randomized controlled trial with three arms (standard care for all groups plus either CBT or relaxation) for 8 wk was conducted, which applied blinded outcome assessments using validated measures with 1 yr of follow-up. The primary outcome for this study was bowel symptom severity. RESULTS: Of 105 patients at the commencement of treatment, the mean bowel symptom frequency score for the whole sample was 21.1 and at the end of treatment had fallen to 18.1; this persisted at the 52-wk follow-up, with a significant linear trend for scores to change over time (F = 39.57 p < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences among the three treatment conditions. Significant changes over time were found for physical functioning (F = 4.37, p < 0.001), pain (F = 3.12, p < 0.05), general health (F = 2.71, p < 0.05), vitality (F = 2.94, p < 0.05), and the social functioning scales on the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (F = 4.08, p < 0.05); however, all three arms showed similar improvement. There were significant reductions in anxiety, depression, and locus of control scales, but no significant differences among the treatment groups were detected. CONCLUSION: Cognitive behavior and relaxation therapy seem not to be superior to standard care alone in IBS.},

Medical conditions that have been reportedly treated or have the potential to be treated with probiotics include diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), cancer, depressed immune function, inadequate lactase digestion, infant allergies, failure-to-thrive, hyperlipidemia, hepatic diseases, Helicobacter pylori infections, genitourinary tract infections, and others.

   abstract = {Diverticular disease of the colon is a common disease worldwide. Although the disease is asymptomatic in about 70-80 % of patients, it represents, at least in Western countries, one of the most important gastrointestinal diseases in terms of direct and indirect health costs. Pathogenesis of the disease is still unknown. However, it is the result of complex interactions between colonic structure, intestinal motility, diet and genetic factors. Whilst efficacious preventive strategies remain to be identified, fibre supplementation in the diet is recommended. Why symptoms develop is still unclear. Results of recent experimental studies on irritable bowel syndrome speculated that low grade inflammation of colonic mucosa, induced by changes in bacterial microflora, could affect the enteric nervous system, which is crucial for normal gut function, thus favouring symptom development. This hypothesis could be extrapolated also for diverticular disease, since bacterial overgrowth is present, at least in a subgroup of patients. These perspectives on symptom development are reviewed and new therapeutic approaches are hypothesized.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is a common condition in general practice. It occurs in 10 to 20% of the population, but less than half seek medical assistance with the complaint. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to the 406 GPs listed on the West Sussex Health Authority Medical List to investigate their views of this condition and whether they felt hypnotherapy had a place in its management RESULTS: 38% of general practitioners responded. The achieved sample shared the characteristics of target sample. Nearly half thought that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was a "nervous complaint" and used a combination of "the placebo effect of personal care," therapeutic, and dietary advice. There is considerable divergence in the perceived effectiveness of current approaches. Over 70% thought that hypnotherapy may have a role in the management of patients with IBS; though the majority (68%) felt that this should not be offered by general practitioners. 84% felt that this should be offered by qualified hypnotherapist, with 40% feeling that this should be offered outside the health service. CONCLUSIONS: General practitioners vary in their perceptions of what constitutes effective therapy in IBS. They are willing to consider referral to a qualified hypnotherapist.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This epidemiological investigation aims to measure the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in the general population using the Rome II criteria and to evaluate the medical management including treatments and the impact of IBS on patient life. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 20,000 French subjects, aged 18 years and over, were interviewed by SOFRES (French Public Opinion Poll Institute) in May 2001. In a second phase (June/July 2001), a 48-question self-administered questionnaire was given to the subjects who have been selected during the first phase as suffering from IBS (Rome II criteria). RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS was 4.7% (confidence interval, 4.36-5.04% with 5% risk) with a predominance in women (5.7% versus 3.7%, P < 0.01). The abdominal pain was often longstanding (> 5 years, 50%), intense (43%) and nocturnal (35%). During the most recent painful episode the levels of associated transit problems were almost equally divided between diarrhoea (36%), constipation (29%) and alternate episodes of both (31%). Apart from pain, bloating was given as the most frequent (73%) and most troublesome (24%) symptom. Since the onset, 80% of subjects with IBS had consulted a doctor (90% consulted a general physician, 57% a gastroenterologist, 50% both) and of these, 80% consulted within the previous 12 months. Sixty-seven per cent of subjects underwent additional investigations since the start of their illness (average of 3.4 examinations per patient examined: colonoscopy, 34.1%; laboratory tests, 34%; and abdominal ultrasound, 27.7%). Over the previous 12 months, 8% of the subjects had been admitted to hospital (average length of stay, 6.6 days), 11% of employed subjects had to take time off, 93% of subjects had taken prescribed medication (87%), but 43% of people thought it was ineffective. The effect on daily life was considerable (score, 6.2/10; close to the score for flu, 7/10). Two-thirds of the individuals changed their diet; 54% said it affected their social life and 29% their professional life. Seventy-four per cent of patients trusted their doctor, with a satisfaction index of 63%, but 45% of patients would like to have more information on IBS. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that the Rome II criteria detected IBS with a prevalence of 4.7%. The recruited subjects had severe symptoms (frequency, intensity and duration) that had a considerable effect on their daily life. The high level of referrals and initial consultations in all categories and the patient's attitudes towards the illness and its treatment emphasize the relative ineffectiveness of care for patients suffering from IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Different food items are made responsible for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, but the physiopathology of IBS remains unclear. AIMS: During a meeting in Nice, France, experts of the European Working Team of the IBiS Club discussed selected data regarding the relationships between alimentation, food items (including fibers) and IBS symptoms. METHODS/RESULTS: Food allergy remains a difficult diagnosis, but medical and general history, presence of general symptoms such as skin rash, and hypersensitivity tests may help in achieving a positive diagnosis. On the other hand, food intolerance is more confusing because of the subjectivity of the relationship between ingestion of certain foods and the appearance of clinical symptoms. Different food items which are commonly implicated in adverse reactions mimicking IBS were found to be stimulants for the gut, suggesting that patients with predominant diarrhea IBS have to be carefully questioned about consumption of different kinds of food (i.e., coffee, alcohol, chewing gum, soft drinks) and not only on lactose ingestion. Gas production is discussed on the basis of retention of intestinal gas as well as on malabsorption of fermentable substrates. The role of a large amount of this kind of substrate reaching the colon is suggested as a potential mechanism of IBS-type symptoms in overeating patients. Regarding the role of fiber in IBS, the expert group concluded that fibers are not inert substances and that they could trigger pain or bloating in some IBS patients. CONCLUSION: Despite numerous reviews on this subject, it is very difficult to give general dietary advice to IBS patients, but dieteticians may have a positive role in managing such patients.},

Although most patients do not seek medical help, the disease accounts for huge costs for both patients and health-care systems and worsens significantly patients' quality of life. Diagnosis is based on the identification of symptoms according to Manning, Rome I and Rome II criteria and exclusion of alarm indicators. IBS symptoms overlap with those of coeliac disease, lactose intolerance, food allergies and bile salt malabsorption. The treatment of IBS is centred on an excellent doctor-patient relationship along with drugs targeting the predominant symptom, especially during exacerbations. Current pharmacological remedies are unsatisfactory due to the high number of patients complaining of lack of response and/or symptom recurrence. Although useful in some IBS patients, the validity of psychotherapy deserves further investigation. A wide array of potentially useful drugs are currently under consideration in pre-clinical trials. A better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying IBS may help to develop more effective drugs for this disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is defined by specific validated symptom criteria and encompasses several different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that express a common set of symptoms. However, IBS is poorly understood by patients. We aimed to explore how a diagnosis of IBS affects the interaction between patients and their physicians. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search for studies in the English language addressing this issue was conducted using Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Database, Psychinfo, Cinahl, Embase, Web of Science and manual recursive search of reference lists. Investigators reviewed and abstracted data from articles fulfilling our inclusion criteria: primary care patients, all ages, gender and ethnic groups diagnosed with IBS by a general practitioner (GP). RESULTS: Retrieval of 121 articles generated only four that met inclusion criteria. Research methods of three studies relied solely on qualitative subjective, anecdotal patient narratives, a bias in favor of patients' negative opinion, absence of objective physician diagnostic criteria, pre-testing questions for two studies, follow-up and patient verification of accounts for accuracy. The fourth study included objective physician diagnostic criteria, quantitative measures, a pre-testing questionnaire, and both patient and doctor perspectives. There was a disparity between patient and GP perception regarding the nature, severity and consequences of IBS in primary care, leading patients to perceive this interaction as one of dissatisfaction. The fourth study revealed GP management of IBS mostly meets patient's expectations areas of concern centered on etiology, diagnostic criteria and dietary advice. Disparity seems to lie with the physician, who needs to provide more trust, knowledge, and sympathy, create rapport and be forthcoming with information, while keeping information simple and understandable. Patient dissatisfaction stems from the actual information provided and how this is communicated. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that some IBS patients in primary care experience dissatisfaction and negative attitudes in GP interactions. Future research should take into account personality attributes and cross-situational stability in addition to methodological implications of studies. GPs may be the first avenue for IBS patients to vent their frustration, and appropriate education programs for optimal management of patients with IBS are needed in primary care.},

Many patients with undiagnosed CD spend years seeking help for complaints such as chronic tiredness or mild abdominal symptoms. In primary care, an appropriate target group to test for CD is people with anaemia (especially women), chronic tiredness, non-specific abdominal symptoms (including so-called "irritable bowel syndrome"), or a family history of CD. The response to an appropriate gluten-free diet is often life-transforming for symptomatic patients. Positive serological tests for CD require confirmation by duodenal biopsy and, if confirmed, referral to a dietitian and a coeliac society, followed by a life-long gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Apley, working in Bristol, UK, defined recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in 1958. After extensive investigations, he found that 8% of children presenting to his clinic with RAP had an organic pathology. The aims of this study were to identify (1) causes of RAP using modern methodology, (2) factors associated with organic RAP and (3) children with non-organic RAP who fulfill the diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Children, aged over 3 years, presenting with RAP were prospectively recruited to this study. They had a detailed questionnaire completed, a full examination with screening tests (blood for coeliac screen, Helicobacter pylori antibody titre, inflammatory markers, serum amylase, liver function tests, and full blood count, urine and stool analyses and abdominal ultrasonography). Endoscopy and oesophageal pH monitoring were performed if clinically indicated. IBS was diagnosed if the child had no organic pathology and fulfilled the Rome II criteria. Out of 103 children (median age of 10 years, mean 10.04, SD +/-3.44), 31 children (30%) had organic pathologies. Factors associated with organic pain were nocturnal symptoms (P<0.01) and abdominal tenderness (P<0.005) and with non-organic pain were periumbilical locality (P<0.002), pain alleviation on defaecation (P<0.04) and low fibre diet (P<0.005). Of children with non-organic pain, 37/52 (51%) fulfilled the criteria for IBS (36% of the total). CONCLUSION: Of children presenting with recurrent abdominal pain in a hospital setting, 30% have a diagnosable organic aetiology compared to 8% in Apley's time. Irritable bowel syndrome, however, may be the commonest cause of recurrent abdominal pain and should be considered.},

Within-woman analyses of daily symptoms also show a strong association of bloating with abdominal pain and intestinal gas (i.e., abdominal pain and intestinal gas are higher on days when bloating is higher) but only a weak association with constipation. Bloating is strongly associated with uterine cramping and breast tenderness, but only when perimenses days are included in the analysis. In conclusion, bloating is a very common symptom in women with IBS that is most strongly related to abdominal pain and intestinal gas but may be confounded with menses-associated symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: A randomized clinical trial was used to test the effectiveness of an 8-session multicomponent program (Comprehensive) compared to a Brief (single session) version and Usual Care for women with irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: Menstruating women, ages 18-48 years, were recruited from a health maintenance organization as well as community advertisements. Psychiatric nurse practitioners delivered both programs. The primary outcomes were improved symptoms, psychological distress, health-related quality of life, and indicators of stress-related hormones. Outcome indicators were measured at 3 points: (1) immediately after the Comprehensive program or 9 weeks after entry into the Usual Care and Brief Self-Management groups, (2) at 6 months, and (3) at 12 months. RESULTS: Compared to Usual Care, women in the Comprehensive program had reduced gastrointestinal symptoms, psychological distress indicators, interruptions in activities because of symptoms, and enhanced quality of life that persisted at the 12-month follow-up evaluation. Women in the Brief group also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in quality of life and smaller nonsignificant improvements in other outcome variables than observed in the Comprehensive group. There were no group differences in urine catecholamines and cortisol levels. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive self-management program is an important therapy approach for women with irritable bowel syndrome. The Brief 1-session version is also moderately helpful for some women with IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meal ingestion is often associated with exacerbation of gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Furthermore, recent preliminary data suggest that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentration in platelet poor plasma is elevated following meal ingestion in some subjects with diarrhoea predominant IBS (d-IBS) compared with healthy subjects, although it is not known whether this is related to postprandial symptomatology. AIM: To expand on previous data by evaluating a larger number of subjects but also to assess plasma 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations, 5-HT turnover, platelet 5-HT stores, and any relationship to symptomatology. METHODS: We assessed platelet depleted plasma 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations for two hours (60 minute intervals) under fasting conditions, and then for a further four hours (30 minute intervals) after a standard carbohydrate meal (457 kcal), together with fasting platelet 5-HT concentrations in 39 female subjects with d-IBS (aged 19-52 years; mean age 33) and 20 healthy female volunteers (aged 20-46 years, mean age 28). IBS symptomatology, in particular abdominal pain and bloating, and urgency to defecate were assessed throughout the study RESULTS: When related to fasting levels, there was no statistically significant difference in postprandial plasma 5-HT concentrations between d-IBS and healthy subjects. However, when fasting levels were not taken into consideration, d-IBS subjects exhibited higher postprandial plasma 5-HT concentrations compared with healthy subjects (p=0.040). Furthermore, d-IBS subjects who exhibited postprandial symptomatology had higher levels of postprandial plasma 5-HT, whether assessed with respect to fasting baseline levels (p=0.069) or not (p=0.047), compared with d-IBS subjects who did not report postprandial symptomatology. This appeared to be associated with a concomitant increase in plasma 5-HIAA (p=0.161) but reduction in turnover (p=0.058). Lastly, d-IBS subjects had higher platelet concentrations of 5-HT than healthy subjects (p=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that postprandial symptomatology may be associated with increased platelet depleted plasma 5-HT concentrations in female subjects with d-IBS. In addition, the presence of increased platelet stores of 5-HT may act as a useful marker for the diagnosis and management of d-IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To review unmet medical needs associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), to discuss factors that contribute to these unmet needs, and to provide an overview of advancements in IBS diagnosis and treatment options that may influence treatment strategies. SUMMARY: IBS is characterized by a multiple symptom complex of abdominal pain or discomfort and altered bowel habits (i.e., constipation, diarrhea, or both in alternation) and is associated with a large unmet medical need. IBS symptoms are chronic and bothersome, and they have a profound negative impact on patients. quality of life (i.e., affecting sleep, personal relationships, travel, diet, and sexual functioning). IBS imposes a substantial economic burden in direct medical costs and in indirect social costs such as absenteeism from work and school and lost productivity, along with the less-measurable costs of a decreased quality of life. The annual cost of IBS treatment in the United States has been estimated to be between $1.7 billion and $10 billion in direct medical costs (excluding prescription and over-the-counter [OTC] drug costs) and $20 billion for indirect costs. The goals of IBS therapy are to provide global relief of the multiple symptoms of IBS and to relieve single IBS symptoms. Although traditional IBS therapies (e.g., laxatives, antidepressants, antispasmodics, and bulking agents) are useful for some patients in relieving single IBS symptoms, patients generally are dissatisfied with their overall efficacy and tolerability. These agents have not been proven in randomized, controlled clinical trials to be more effective than placebo in providing global relief of the multiple symptoms of IBS. Over the past 2 decades, numerous advancements in the diagnosis and management of IBS have provided hope for the future, including research strides in our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of IBS; new diagnostic and management recommendations based on a stepwise, symptom-based approach; and the development of novel pharmacologic agents. CONCLUSION: IBS imposes a high socioeconomic burden on its sufferers and on society. Research strides in the underlying pathophysiology of this disorder have enhanced our understanding of IBS, but many questions remain to be answered. Development of evidence-based guidelines on the stepwise, symptom-based approach to IBS diagnosis and the continuing efforts to develop unique pharmacologic classes targeted at the multiple symptoms of this disorder are steps in the right direction. Though cost-effectiveness data on specific pharmacologic classes are not yet available, these ongoing efforts may help promote timely IBS diagnosis and patient satisfaction with care, optimally decreasing the use of health care resources.},

   abstract = {Zinc is known to be essential for all highly proliferating cells in the human body, especially the immune system. A variety of in vivo and in vitro effects of zinc on immune cells mainly depend on the zinc concentration. All kinds of immune cells show decreased function after zinc depletion. In monocytes, all functions are impaired, whereas in natural killer cells, cytotoxicity is decreased, and in neutrophil granulocytes, phagocytosis is reduced. The normal functions of T cells are impaired, but autoreactivity and alloreactivity are increased. B cells undergo apoptosis. Impaired immune functions due to zinc deficiency are shown to be reversed by an adequate zinc supplementation, which must be adapted to the actual requirements of the patient. High dosages of zinc evoke negative effects on immune cells and show alterations that are similar to those observed with zinc deficiency. Furthermore, when peripheral blood mononuclear cells are incubated with zinc in vitro, the release of cytokines such as interleukins (IL)-1 and -6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, soluble IL-2R and interferon-gamma is induced. In a concentration of 100 micro mol/L, zinc suppresses natural killer cell killing and T-cell functions whereas monocytes are activated directly, and in a concentration of 500 micro mol/L, zinc evokes a direct chemotactic activation of neutrophil granulocytes. All of these effects are discussed in this short overview.},

CONCLUSIONS: Physiological mechanisms not easily identifiable as an organic cause may underlie symptoms in RAP patients. They may be triggered by psychosocial factors that result in greater functional disability, more clinic visits, and lower academic and social competence. Of these children, 25% will experience similar symptoms as adults; many will be diagnosed with IBS. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Nurses can provide early and efficient management of these children's care if they view the issues of abdominal pain/discomfort from a broader focus that includes the context of the child's experiences.},

Recently, analysis of bowel sounds becomes possible. We analyzed bowel sounds in healthy volunteers and measured platelet depleted plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) that may be associated with postprandial symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: We recorded both fasting and postprandial bowel sounds for 30 minutes in 16 healthy volunteers with a sensitive electronic stethoscope attached to a digital recorder. The files were saved in computer as wav files and analyzed with a specialized program. Blood samples were also taken before and 1 hour after meal for 5-HT analysis. RESULTS: Meal challenge made no statistically significant changes in the 5-HT concentrations and all the sound parameters including sound to sound interval, sounds/minute, average of sound amplitudes, sound length, percentage of bowel sounds representing sound clustering and dominant frequency of sounds. CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial changes in bowel sounds and plasma 5-HT were insignificant in healthy Korean volunteers.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS) mainly includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). UC and CD are chronic and recurrent conditions, with a tendency to exacerbations and remissions. The incidence of diseases worldwide has increased over the last years. Although the etiology of inflammatory bowel syndrome has been studied intensively it still remains unclear. The development and persistence of inflammation is an effect of numerous factors: proinflammatory (aggressive), regulating bowel mucosa homeostasis and protective factors. Proinflammatory factors include intestinal bacteria, bile acids, digestive enzymes, lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans. Protective mechanisms are impermeability of mucosa barrier, presence of intestinal mucus, activity of secretive immunoglobulins, some prostaglandins and interleukins, glutamine, somatostatin, cortisol and short-chain fatty acids. Factors modifying intestinal mucosa homeostasis consist of genetically determined immunoregulators and activity of intestinal mucosa barrier and some environmental factors (diet, smoking, infections, stress, antibiotics and others). Environmental factors are jointly responsible for IBS occurrence in case of genetically determined dysregulation leading to proinflammatory cytokines overproduction or disturbances in synthesis of cytokines regulating intestinal mucosa homeostasis.},

   abstract = {Colonic diverticula are protrusions of the mucosa through the outer muscular layers, which are usually abnormally thickened, to form narrow necked pouches. Diverticular disease of the colon covers a wide clinical spectrum: from an incidental finding to symptomatic uncomplicated disease to diverticulitis. A quarter of patients with diverticulitis will develop potentially life-threatening complications including perforation, fistulae, obstruction or stricture. In Western countries diverticular disease predominantly affects the left colon, its prevalence increases with age and its causation has been linked to a low dietary fibre intake. Right-sided diverticular disease is more commonly seen in Asian populations and affects younger patients. Its pathogenesis and relationship to left-sided diverticular disease remains unclear. Diverticular disease of the colon is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western world and its frequency has increased throughout the whole of the 20th century. Since it is a disease of the elderly, and with an aging population, it can be expected to occupy an increasing portion of the surgical and gastroenterological workload. It is uncertain what symptoms uncomplicated diverticular disease gives rise to: there is an overlap with irritable bowel syndrome. Diagnosis is primarily by barium enema and colonoscopy, but more sophisticated imaging procedures such as computed tomography (CT) are increasingly being used to assess and treat complications such as abscess or fistula, or to provide alternative diagnoses if diverticulosis is not confirmed. Initial therapy for uncomplicated diverticulitis is supportive, including monitoring, bowel rest and antibacterials. CT is used to guide percutaneous drainage of abscesses to avoid surgery or allow it to be performed as an elective procedure. Surgery is indicated for complications of acute diverticulitis, including failure of medical treatment, gross perforation, and abscess formation that cannot be resolved by percutaneous drainage. Complications of chronic diverticulitis (fistula formation, stricture and obstruction) are also usually treated surgically. However, the indications for, and the timing and staging of operations for diverticular disease are often difficult decisions requiring sound clinical judgement. Factors such as the number of episodes of inflammation, the age of the patient, and his/her overall medical condition play a role in determining whether or not a patient should undergo surgical resection. Laparoscopic surgery may be associated with less pain, less morbidity and shorter hospital stays, but its exact role is yet to be defined. Diverticular disease of the colon is the most common cause of acute lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage, which can be massive. Although the majority of patients stop bleeding spontaneously, angiographic and surgical treatment may be required, while the place of endoscopic haemostasis remains to be established.},

METHODS: 998 of 1250 individuals (mean age 38.99+0.44) replied to our questionnaire including Rome II criteria. RESULTS: We found the irritable bowel syndrome prevalence in the city center of Sivas to be 19.1%. Distribution of irritable bowel syndrome (+) patients age groups showed no significant difference but irritable bowel syndrome was significantly more common in females. The most common occupation showing irritable bowel syndrome positivity was workers. Irritable bowel syndrome prevalence was also significantly higher in persons not eating three regular meals per day. There was a significantly positive correlation between irritable bowel syndrome prevalence and psychological events, previous abdominal operations and infections. A change in bowel habitus was observed in 41.8% of irritable bowel syndrome patients, and the most common change was constipation. 39.8% of the irritable bowel syndrome patients had applied to the doctor, most often to doctors of internal medicine. We found the irritable bowel syndrome prevalence not to be related with educational status, smoking, daily tea and coffee consumption, alcohol intake, menstrual periods or weight loss. CONCLUSION: Irritable bowel syndrome prevalence in our region with its demographic characteristics was similar to the results seen in western countries.},

Seventy-six adult celiac patients were analyzed according to nutritional status and 18 children/adolescents to gluten-free diet adherence. As controls, 84 adults and 22 adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome were used The significant findings were observed as follow: adult celiac patients, irrespective of the nutritional status, were younger than controls, presented delayed menarche, secondary amenorrhea, a higher percentage of spontaneous abortions, anemia and hypoalbuminemia. No differences were observed regarding the number of pregnancies, age at menopause and duration of the reproductive period. After treatment, patients presented with normal pregnancies and one patient presented spontaneous abortion. The adolescents who were not adherent to gluten-free diet presented delayed menarche and secondary amenorrhea. In conclusion, gluten per se could explain the disturbances and malnutrition would worsen the disease in a consequent vicious cycle. Therefore, celiac disease should be included in the screening of reproductive disorders.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A major health care trend in the last decade has been the increased use of complementary and alternative medicine and nutritional supplements. Indeed, we now have Physician's Desk References for both herbal therapies and dietary supplements. A large amount of out-of-pocket dollars are spent on complementary and alternative medicine each year in the United States, and complementary and alternative medicine users believe strongly in the efficacy of their treatments. RECENT FINDINGS: In the area of inflammatory bowel disease, probiotics appear to be a highly promising form of therapy. In acute pancreatitis, enteral nutrition has been shown to be safe and effective. Peppermint oil is one of the most widely used complementary and alternative medicine therapies for irritable bowel syndrome. Antioxidants are increasingly used in liver disease, especially agents involved in methionine metabolism. Both S-adenosylmethionine and betaine have shown efficacy in animal models of alcoholic liver disease, and "knockout" mice that develop S-adenosylmethionine deficiency also develop steatohepatitis. Thus, there is great interest in these complementary and alternative medicine agents in both alcoholic liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. There are also important safety issues related to complementary and alternative medicine. Deaths of well-known athletes have highlighted the risks of ephedra, and some research suggests that complementary and alternative medicine agents are a major cause of fulminant liver failure necessitating liver transplantation. SUMMARY: Thus, physicians must be aware not only of the potential therapeutic benefits of complementary and alternative medicine agents and nutritional supplements, but also their potential risks, including toxicity and drug interactions.},

The quality of studies was assessed using 5-point scale. Meta-analyses were performed on all studies, and on 'high-quality studies'. The efficacy of fibre in the global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms relief (OR: 1.9; 95% CI:1.5-2.4) was lost after exclusion of low-quality trials (OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0-2.0, P = 0.06). When excluding the low-quality trials, an improvement of global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms with all antispasmodics (OR: 2.1; 95% CI:1.8-2.9) was maintained only for octylonium bromide, but on the basis of only two studies. Antidepressants were effective (OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.9-3.5), even after exclusion of low-quality studies (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.7). Alosetron (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.9-2.6) and tegaserod (OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.2-1.5) showed a significant effect in women. We recommend the use of tegaserod for women with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and alosetron for women with severe irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea. Antidepressants can be beneficial for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea patients with severe symptoms. Loperamide can be recommended in painless diarrhoea. Evidence is weak to recommend the use of bulking agents in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.},

OBJECTIVE: To find out the absolute fiber intake from different sources of food items in patients with IBS and healthy subjects from northern India. METHODS: Using the 72-hour recall method, dietary intake of macronutrients and fiber was determined in 33 consecutive adult patients with IBS and 33 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: The patients consumed lower amounts of macronutrients (protein 60.4 g vs 79.3 g, fat 47.7 g vs 65.7 g, and carbohydrates 294.6 g vs 339.8 g) and dietary fiber (8.1 g vs 15.7 g) than the control subjects. Though the patients consumed similar amount of pulses as the controls (46.6 [25.0] vs 46 [19.6] g/day), their fiber intake from pulses was lower (0.8 [0.7] vs 1.4 [0.9] g/day). The intake of fiber from vegetables and fruits was also significantly lower in patients (2.1 and 0.5 g/day, respectively) than in control subjects (5.8 and 3.9 g/day, respectively; p< 0.001 each). CONCLUSION: Total dietary fiber intake and intake of fiber from vegetables, fruits and pulses are lower in patients with IBS from northern India than in control subjects.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and its long-term complications are associated with an expanding social medical problem. In order to originate an established teaching and training program on a physician-based level in short time, three specialist diabetes centers from Lubeck transferred their concept to a diabetes organization based on 17 physicians who had only rarely undertaken any diabetes teaching before. We investigated the achievement and effectiveness of this concept in a prospective multicenter evaluation one year after the patients had received structured diabetes teaching by the organization. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Physicians and their teaching staff were trained by the specialists from the diabetes centers according to an official agreement. Patients were treated by each practice, while the diabetes teaching was done centrally by the organization through a diabetes assistant/dietician based on a modified official diabetes teaching and training program (ZI-program). 230 of 250 patients (120 male, 110 female) were reinvestigated one year after they had received the teaching. The group consisted of 179 non-insulin-treated (NIB; 94 via physicians, 85 via specialists) and 51 insulin-treated (IB; 19 via physicians, 32 via specialists) participants. RESULTS: The average age of NIB was 60.4+/-9.8 years, while IBs were 68.8+/-7.3 years old. HbA (1c) values were reduced in both groups, NIB and IB, by approximately 1% (NIB: 7.59+/-1.97% to 6.59+/-1.84%; IB: 8.47+/-1.35% to 7,36+/-1,38 %; p < 0,001). In the NIB-group the BMI was reduced by 0,64+/-0,14 kg x m (-2), whereas it was increased in the IB-group by 0.33+/-0.24 kg x m(-2) (NIB: 30.55+/-0.40 to 29.91+/-0.39 kg x m(-2), p < 0.001; IB: 28.83+/-0.74 to 29.16+/-0.75 kg x m(-2), p = 0.82). CONCLUSION: The transfer of established teaching and training concepts of specialist diabetes centers to a newly founded, physician-based diabetes organization resulted in a broad, effective and long-lasting medical care of patients with type 2 diabetics treated without or with insulin. The results are superior to those of other evaluations based on diabetes training ZI-programs.},

AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of coeliac disease testing in suspected irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: We used decision analysis to estimate the number of coeliac disease cases detected, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and costs resulting from testing suspected irritable bowel syndrome patients for tissue transglutaminase antibody or an antibody panel (tissue transglutaminase, gliadin, total immunoglobulin A). Positive tests prompted endoscopic biopsy. A gluten-free diet improved quality of life in coeliac disease. RESULTS: Assuming a coeliac disease prevalence of 3%, tissue transglutaminase detected 28 and the panel detected 29 of 30 coeliac disease cases among 1000 suspected irritable bowel syndrome patients. The cost/case detected was $4600 with tissue transglutaminase and $8800 with the panel. The cost/quality-adjusted life-year gained with tissue transglutaminase was $7400, and the incremental cost/quality-adjusted life-year gained for the panel vs. tissue transglutaminase was $287 000. Tissue transglutaminase cost under $100 000/quality-adjusted life-year gained at a coeliac disease prevalence >/=1.1%, assuming a modest utility gain of 0.005 with coeliac disease diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for coeliac disease in patients with suspected irritable bowel syndrome is likely to be cost-effective even at a relatively low coeliac disease prevalence and with small improvements in quality of life with a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the benefits of a hyperimmune egg powder supplement for treating irritable bowel syndrome in 2 patients. CLINICAL FEATURES: The first patient, not under chiropractic care, had been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome by her primary care physician. She sought care due to failure of several other alternative therapies. Her primary care physician ordered specific dietary modifications, yet this regimen did not appear to improve her symptoms. The second patient, also diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome by her primary care physician, decided to seek care because the attending physician was concurrently treating her for idiopathic scoliosis, and both treatments could be administered at 1 office visit. Her primary reason for seeking this treatment was her longstanding episodic intestinal cramping and diarrhea. She overheard another patient in the same clinic discussing how the hyperimmune egg powder had alleviated her digestive complaints and decided to undergo a 2-week trial of the hyperimmune egg powder. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The first subject was given a 31- day supply of the hyperimmune egg powder. She reported significant subjective improvement in frequency of defecation and stool consistency after 48 hours. She kept a daily journal to monitor her bowel habits during the trial period. The second subject was provided a 15-day supply of hyperimmune egg powder and instructed to keep the same daily journal to monitor her bowel habits. During the second week of the trial, she noticed less frequent bowel habits and a more solid stool consistency. However, shortly after she stopped taking the hyperimmune egg powder, the pre-trial symptoms returned. Because of this, she was put back on the hyperimmune egg powder, and the symptoms improved thereafter. CONCLUSION: The addition of hyperimmune egg powder into an ordinary daily diet may have improved bowel function in 2 subjects, at least subjectively. However, it is unclear whether the subjective improvements are due to the hyperimmune egg powder or any psychosomatic effect created by physician contact, regardless of treatment type. This study should be repeated on a larger scale with a control group before any conclusions are made.},

In this study, we evaluate the ability of an elemental diet to normalize the lactulose breath test (LBT) in IBS subjects with abnormal breath test findings. Consecutive subjects with IBS and abnormal LBT suggesting the presence of bacterial overgrowth underwent a 2-week exclusive elemental diet. The diet consisted of Vivonex Plus (Novartis Nutrition Corp., Minneapolis, MN) in a quantity based on individual caloric requirement. On day 15 (prior to solid food), subjects returned for a follow-up breath test and those with an abnormal LBT were continued on the diet for an additional 7 days. The ability of an elemental diet to normalize the LBT was determined for days 15 and 21. A chart review was then conducted to evaluate any clinical benefit 1 month later. Of the 93 subjects available for analysis, 74 (80%) had a normal LBT on day 15 of the elemental diet. When those who continued to day 21 were included, five additional patients normalized the breath test (85%). On chart review, subjects who successfully normalized their breath test had a 66.4 +/- 36.1% improvement in bowel symptoms, compared to 11.9 +/- 22.0% in those who failed to normalize (P < 0.001). An elemental diet is highly effective in normalizing an abnormal LBT in IBS subjects, with a concomitant improvement in clinical symptoms.},

   abstract = {Constipation is a common clinical problem that comprises a constellation of symptoms that include excessive straining, hard stools, feeling of incomplete evacuation, use of digital maneuvers, or infrequent defecation. Although many conditions, such as metabolic problems, fiber deficiency, anorectal problems, and drugs, can cause constipation, when excluded functional constipation consists of two subtypes: slow-transit constipation and dyssynergic defecation. Some patients with irritable bowel syndrome may exhibit features of both types of constipation. The Rome criteria for functional constipation together with modifications proposed here for dyssynergic defecation may serve as useful guidelines for making a diagnosis. Recent advances in technology, together with a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms, have led to real progress in the diagnosis of this condition. Management options are limited, however, and evidence to support these treatments is only modest. The treatment is primarily medical; surgical options should be reserved for refractory disease and after careful diagnostic work-up. Although laxatives remain the mainstay of therapy, prokinetics that are colon-selective are optimal for treating patients with slow-transit constipation, but they are not yet available for clinical use. Recent controlled trials, however, are promising. Biofeedback therapy is the preferred treatment for patients with dyssynergia, but is not widely available. In the near future, user-friendly biofeedback programs including home therapy may facilitate wider use of these methods for patients with dyssynergic defecation.},

   abstract = {About 10,000 years ago domestication and farming of wheat and other cereals developed in the 'Fertile Crescent', an area including modern Turkey, Iraq and Iran. Agriculture then slowly spread from Middle East to Europe. Coeliac disease is the permanent intolerance to dietary gluten, the major protein component of wheat. It has been until relatively recently hypothesised that wheat consumption exerted a negative selective pressure on genes predisposing to coeliac disease, eventually leading to higher coeliac disease frequency in Northeastern Europe because of lack of exposure to cereals. This theory is at variance with recent studies showing that coeliac disease is as common in Middle Eastern countries as in Europe. High prevalence of coeliac disease has been found in Iran, in both the general population and at-risk groups, e.g. patients with irritable bowel syndrome or type 1 diabetes. Clinical manifestations of coeliac disease vary markedly with the age of the patient, the duration and the extent of disease. Clinical studies showed that presentation with non-specific symptoms or no symptoms is as common in the Middle East as in Europe. Wheat represented a major component of the Iranian diet for many centuries and it may be argued that the continuous and high level of exposure to wheat proteins has induced some degree of immune tolerance, leading to milder symptoms that may be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome or unexplained gastrointestinal disorders. The gluten-free diet represents a real challenge to both patients and clinicians in this area. This is particularly difficult in the absence of any supply for gluten-free diet in Middle Eastern countries.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The impact of education on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is not well known. This study evaluated the effect of a onetime group education program on patient-based outcomes in IBS. METHODS: All adults referred by Mayo Clinic physicians to the Gastroenterology Division with a diagnosis of IBS between May 1997 and March 1998 were asked to participate. Questionnaires were administered at baseline and 6 months. Symptom resolution, change in pain severity, quality of life, Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile score, overall patient satisfaction, and health care utilization were compared among those patients who attended the multidisciplinary class and those who did not. RESULTS: Of the 506 patients approached, 403 (80%) agreed to participate. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed in 344 patients (85%) on chart review; 211 patients (61%) subsequently completed a follow-up questionnaire. Overall, 29% of class attendees who met Rome criteria for IBS at baseline no longer met Rome criteria at follow-up, compared with 7% of nonattendees. By multivariate analysis, class attendance predicted higher odds of not meeting Rome criteria at follow-up in individuals meeting Rome criteria at baseline (odds ratio, 7.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-64.41) than in nonattendees, but the opposite effect was seen with class attendance in those not meeting Rome criteria at baseline. This interaction between baseline Rome status and class attendance was significant (P < 0.05). Class attendance was associated with improvement in Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile scores (P < 0.05) but not with change in pain, quality of life, satisfaction, or health care utilization. CONCLUSIONS: A onetime, multidisciplinary class for patients with IBS was associated with improvement in symptoms and health-promoting lifestyle behavior.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease may easily mimic symptoms which are parts of the criteria used for diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome. AIM: To find the frequency of coeliac disease among patients diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: During a period of one year, irritable bowel syndrome patients referred to a university clinic in Tehran were studied. For each patient, an asymptomatic sibling was enrolled as control. Serological tests for coeliac disease were performed in all patients and controls. If positive, duodenal biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis. Patients subsequently diagnosed as coeliac disease were placed on a gluten free diet and re-evaluated after 6 months. RESULTS: One hundred and five cases of irritable bowel syndrome and 105 controls were enrolled. Coeliac disease was diagnosed in 12 of the irritable bowel syndrome patients and none of the controls. Eleven coeliac disease patients adhered to a gluten free diet. After 6 months, all 11 patients had significant improvement in symptoms and three were totally asymptomatic. Six allowed repeated endoscopy after 6 months of gluten free diet, of which five showed improvement in histological findings. CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease is a common finding among patients labelled as irritable bowel syndrome. In this sub-group, a gluten free diet may lead to a significant improvement in symptoms. Routine testing for coeliac disease may be indicated in all patients being evaluated for irritable bowel syndrome.},

METHODS: All relevant papers published on partially hydrolyzed guar gum were reviewed and the results summarized. RESULTS: Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a water-soluble dietary fiber with a wide range of uses in clinical nutrition. Its low viscosity allows its use in enteral products and beverages. PHGG can be added to enteral formulas and food products as a dietary fiber source. PHGG provides the benefits associated with dietary fiber ingestion. Addition of PHGG to the diet reduced laxative dependence in a nursing home population. PHGG also reduced the incidence of diarrhea in septic patients receiving total enteral nutrition and reduced symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. PHGG also increased production of Bifidobacterium in the gut. CONCLUSION: The ease of use of PHGG and its clinical effectiveness make it a good choice in clinical nutrition practice.},

Failure of proper migration and differentiation of enteric neurons or ICC can result from specific genetic mutations and lead to phenotypes of CIP with or without concomitant gastroparesis. Intestinal dysfunction in diabetes may reflect a depletion of NO production (and perhaps other neurotransmitters or modulators), which is manifest as a syndrome of gastroparesis, diarrhea, or constipation in individual patients. As the key molecular changes underlying these disorders are defined, clinicians will begin to understand their precise etiology and rational medical therapy may become possible. In the future, testable hypotheses regarding the etiology of other functional bowel disorders (e.g., functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and so forth) may be developed.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and disturbed defecation in the absence of other medical conditions with similar presentations. Because physical findings and currently available diagnostic tests lack sufficient specificity for clinical use, the diagnosis of IBS is based on characteristic symptoms as outlined in several symptom-based criteria for IBS. When used in combination with a detailed history, physical examination, and limited diagnostic testing, these criteria are a valid method of diagnosing IBS. Once a confident diagnosis of IBS has been made, treatment of IBS should be based on the predominant symptom while taking into account the severity of symptoms and the degree of functional impairment both physically and psychologically. Most patients with IBS have mild symptoms and education, reassurance, dietary and lifestyle changes, and a therapeutic physician-patient relationship form the backbone of treatment. A smaller number of patients have moderate symptoms, which are typically intermittent, but may at times interrupt their normal activities. In addition to dietary and lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic intervention based on the predominant symptom (diarrhea, constipation, or pain) may be used to relieve symptoms. Finally, a small subset of patients has severe or intractable symptoms. These patients, often seen in tertiary referral centers, often have constant pain symptoms and psychosocial impairments. A multidisciplinary approach including pharmacologic treatments, psychologic treatments, and possibly a mental health or pain center involvement may be beneficial.},

We explored a variety of treatments that exist beyond the scope of commonly used therapies for irritable bowel syndrome. Guarded optimism exists for traditional Chinese medicine and psychological therapies, but further well-designed trials are needed. Oral cromolyn sodium may be useful in chronic unexplained diarrhea and appears as effective as and safer than elimination diets. The roles of lactose and fructose intolerance remain poorly understood. Alterations of enteric flora may play a role in irritable bowel syndrome, but supporting evidence for bacterial overgrowth or probiotic therapy is lacking.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) may have undiagnosed celiac sprue (CS). Because the symptoms of CS respond to a gluten-free diet, testing for CS in IBS may prevent years of morbidity and attendant expense. We sought to determine whether this might be a cost-effective diagnostic strategy in IBS-D. METHODS: We used decision analysis to calculate the cost-effectiveness of 2 competing strategies in IBS-D: (1) start empirical IBS treatment and (2) perform serologic test for CS followed by endoscopic biopsy for positive tests. The base-case cohort had a CS prevalence of 3.4%, which was varied between 0% and 100% in sensitivity analysis. The outcome measure was cost per symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Under base-case conditions, testing for CS instead of starting empiric IBS therapy cost an incremental $11,000 to achieve one additional symptomatic improvement. Testing for CS became the dominant strategy when the prevalence of CS exceeded 8%, the specificity of CS testing exceeded 98%, or the cost of IBS therapy exceeded $130/month. The incremental cost-effectiveness of testing for CS exceeded $50,000 when the prevalence fell below 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for CS in patients with IBS-D has an acceptable cost when the prevalence of CS is above 1% and is the dominant strategy when the prevalence exceeds 8%. The decision to test should be based on a consideration of the population prevalence of underlying CS, the operating characteristics of the screening test employed, and the cost of proposed therapy for IBS.},

OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the epidemiology, pathophysiology, symptomatology and management of common presentations of diverticular disease including a brief review of surgical management. DISCUSSION: Management is based on the patient's symptoms and signs with assistance from findings at colonoscopy, computerised tomography scanning and occasionally bleeding localisation studies. For minimally symptomatic patients, a high fibre diet is the mainstay of management. Those with diverticulitis require antibiotics and bowel rest, and hospitalisation may be required. Surgery is indicated for recurrent diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis, perforation and severe bleeding. This involves resection of the affected colon segment and can be performed laparoscopically or open.},

METHODS: DESIGN: Trial of HFD alone (Group 1) followed by a randomized, double-blind trial of HFD with paroxetine or placebo (Group 2). SETTING: Gastroenterology office in a 524-bed university-affiliated community hospital in Pittsburgh. PATIENTS: Men and women, aged 18-65 yr, previously diagnosed with IBS but otherwise healthy. INTERVENTION: Institution of HFD in 98 participants consuming low- or average-fiber diets. Allocation of paroxetine to 38 and placebo to 43 symptomatic participants consuming HFDs. MEASUREMENTS: Overall well-being, abdominal pain, and abdominal bloating (Groups 1 and 2); food avoidance, work functioning, and social functioning (Group 2). RESULTS: In Group 1, overall well-being improved in 26% patients, and abdominal pain and bloating decreased in 22% and 26% patients, respectively, with an HFD. In Group 2, overall well-being improved more with paroxetine than with placebo (63.3%vs 26.3%; p= 0.01), but abdominal pain, bloating, and social functioning did not. With paroxetine, food avoidance decreased (p= 0.03) and work functioning was marginally better (p= 0.08). Before unblinding, more paroxetine recipients than placebo recipients wanted to continue their study medication (84%vs 37%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The difference in overall well-being found in our paroxetine/placebo trial is greater than that found in previously published drug/placebo trials for IBS. Moreover, the difference in well-being applied to nondepressed recipients of paroxetine.},

   abstract = {The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains a therapeutic challenge in part because of the limited understanding of the pathophysiology. The placebo response rate varies in randomized controlled trials from 20 to 70%, and can persist for up to at least 1 year. It is contentious whether dietary fibre and bulking agents relieve the symptoms of IBS; constipation probably improves. Anticholinergic and antispasmodic agents are of questionable benefit in IBS despite positive meta-analyses of poor quality trials. A meta-analysis concluded that the tricyclic antidepressants were superior to placebo in IBS, although the individual trial results were variable. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are of uncertain benefit. Laxatives are used for constipation but probably poorly control the IBS symptom complex. Loperamide is superior to placebo in improvement of diarrhoea but not abdominal pain in IBS. Tegaserod is a well- tolerated aminoguanidine indole derivative of serotonin that is a partial 5HT4-receptor agonist with prokinetic properties; a therapeutic gain over placebo of 5% to 15% has been observed in constipation-predominant IBS in females. Alosetron is a 5HT3-receptor antagonist that is efficacious in females with diarrhoea-predominant IBS, with a 12% to 17% therapeutic gain; the risk of ischaemic colitis is 1 in 350, with very severe constipation occurring in about 1 in 1000. Optimizing study design remains a challenge in IBS. New visceral analgesic and motility modifying agents, as well as anti-inflammatory agents are in trials, and hopefully additional efficacious therapeutic options for patients with IBS will soon emerge.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional bowel disease in the West. Information on the prevalence of IBS in the Asian population is relatively scanty. The aims of the present study were to determine the prevalence of IBS and to assess the symptom subgroups based on the predominant bowel habit in a young adult population of Asian origin. METHODS: Basic demographic data and symptoms of IBS using the Rome I criteria were sought using a questionnaire administered to all apparently healthy students in a medical school. Other questions asked related to alcohol intake, smoking, chili consumption, dietary fiber intake, and to psychological and psychosomatic symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, headache, and backache. The health-care seeking behavior of the subjects was also analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 610 questionnaires administered, 533 complete responses were received (response rate of 87.4%). The responders comprised 229 men (43.0%) and 304 (57.0%) women with a mean age of 22 +/- 1.8 years. The ethnic distribution was Malays 278 (52.2%), Chinese 179 (33.6%), Indians 46 (8.6%), and others 30 (5.6%). Eighty-four (15.8%) reported symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of IBS, predominantly women. Sixty-five (77.4%) and six (7.1%) were of the constipation-predominant and diarrhea-predominant IBS subgroups, respectively. Thirteen (15.5%) subjects fell into the non-specific IBS subgroup. The self-reported psychological and psychosomatic symptoms of anxiety (P = 0.02), depression (P = 0.002), insomnia (P = 0.006), headache (P = 0.04), and backache (P = 0.006) were encountered more frequently in the subjects with IBS. Only 13.1% of the IBS group had consulted their health-care practitioner, and 20.2% reported self-medication. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms supportive of the diagnosis of IBS were common among young Malaysians, with a prevalence rate of 15.8%. There were significantly more women with IBS than men. Within the IBS population, the majority (77.4%) was of the constipation-predominant IBS subgroup. A significantly higher prevalence of psychological and psychosomatic symptoms was found in individuals with IBS. Only a minority sought medical advice for their symptoms.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders. The prevalence rate is 10-20% and women have a higher prevalence. IBS adversely affects quality of life and is associated with health care use and costs. IBS comprises a group of functional bowel disorders in which abdominal discomfort or pain is associated with defecation or a change in bowel habit, and with features of disordered defecation. The consensus definition and criteria for IBS have been formalized in the "Rome II criteria". Food, psychiatric disorders, and gastroenteritis are risk factors for developing IBS. The mechanism in IBS involves biopsychosocial disorders; psychosocial factors, altered motility, and heightened sensory function. Brain-gut interaction is the most important in understanding the pathophysiology of IBS. Effective management requires an effective physician-patient relationship. Dietary treatment, lifestyle therapy, behavioral therapy, and pharmacologic therapy play a major role in treating IBS. Calcium polycarbophil can benefit IBS patients with constipation or alternating diarrhea and constipation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between hydrogen and methane production is a possible confounding factor in the interpretation of H(2) breath tests (HBT), but is usually disregarded for the interpretation of HBT and, in most instances, only H(2) excretion is measured. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of predominant fasting methane CH(4) or H(2) production on the outcome of lactose HBT, in a large, homogeneous series of adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A lactose HBT was performed in 237 IBS patients with predominant fasting methane production (CH(4)>H(2)), recording the outcome of the test, amount of gas excreted and occurrence of clinical symptoms. Data were compared to those of 237 age- and sex-matched IBS patients with low fasting CH(4) excretion. RESULTS: The test was positive in 124 predominant CH(4) producers (52.3%) (PMP), as compared to 201 (84.8%) low methane producers (LMP) (P<0.0001). Peak hydrogen concentration and area under the curve of H(2) were significantly (P<0.001) lower, and the occurrence of symptoms during the test less frequent, in PMP vs LMP patients. During the test, CH(4) excretion doubled in 57/113 (50.4%) patients with negative HBT, and in 49/124 (39.5%) with positive HBT. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with predominant fasting methane production excrete less H(2) than LMP, after an oral load of lactose. The lower prevalence of severe lactose intolerance in PMP, as well as lower incidence of symptoms during the test, is, indeed, related to lower and slower H(2) excretion. The assumption that H(2) excretion is an effective means of quantifying the amount of malabsorbed carbohydrates is questionable in PMP. Methane-producing patients likely have a higher 'false negative' rate as compared to LMP after an oral load of lactose. Nonetheless, as symptoms are related to the amount of gas produced in the colon, HBT identifies patients with 'lactose intolerance', irrespective of the presence of lactose malabsorption, and helps in predicting the effect of lactose-restricted diet.},

   abstract = {The treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) has historically been based on the severity of symptoms, with education, reassurance, dietary advice, bulking agents and laxative therapy offered as appropriate. Tegaserod (Zelnorm, Zelmac) is the first selective serotonin 5-HT(4) receptor partial agonist to be approved for the treatment of this syndrome. Tegaserod is active against multiple irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms; it stimulates gut motility and reduces visceral sensitivity and pain. The drug does not cure IBS and was not designed to treat the diarrhoea-predominant version. Its efficacy in men has not been established. Three large well designed clinical trials of tegaserod 6 mg twice daily for 12 weeks in patients (mainly women) with IBS-C have demonstrated superiority versus placebo in global relief from symptoms. Global relief response rates were 38.4-46.8% with tegaserod 6 mg twice daily and 28.3-38.8% with placebo (p < 0.05-0.0001 vs placebo). The relative increases in response rates with tegaserod 6 mg twice daily over the already high responses in the placebo groups ranged from 12-65% after 4-12 weeks of treatment. A response was seen within the first week. The proportion of patients with satisfactory relief from symptoms fell over the 4-week period following withdrawal of tegaserod and placebo, but did not reach baseline levels during this time. Diarrhoea has been associated with tegaserod in clinical trials (an incidence of about 10% versus 5% with placebo, usually occurring in the first week of treatment), but the drug is otherwise well tolerated. There were no apparent changes in the tolerability profile with extended tegaserod treatment (</=12 months). In conclusion, oral tegaserod 6 mg twice daily for 12 weeks is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of IBS-C in women. Data on long term and comparative efficacy, cost-effectiveness and quality-of-life effects would be beneficial; however, in light of the fact that very few alternatives for the treatment of IBS-C have proven efficacy, tegaserod appears to be a promising option in women not responding to increased dietary fibre or osmotic laxative therapy.},

   abstract = {AIM: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disorder in the Western population, but detailed population-based data in China are limited. The aim of this study was to understand the epidemiology of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux (SGER) in adults of Xi'an, a northwestern city of China, and to explore the potential risk factors of GERD. METHODS: Symptoms suggestive of GERD, functional dyspepsia (FD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), upper respiratory diseases and some potential risk factors were investigated in a face-to-face manner in a region-stratified random samples of 2789 residents aged 18-70 years in Xi'an by using a standardized questionnaire. METHODS: With a response rate of 91.8%, the prevalence of SGER was 16.98% (95% CI, 14.2-18.92) in Xi'an adults, and no gender-related difference was observed (P<0.05). SGER was more common among subjects aged 30-70 years than in those aged 18-29 years (P<0.01). The prevalence of SGER in rural, urban and suburban subjects was 21.07%, 17.44% and 12.12%, respectively, and there was a significant difference between rural, urban and suburban regions (P<0.05). Compared with subjects without SGER, the prevalence of symptoms suggestive of FD and IBS, pneumonia, asthma, bronchitis, laryngitis, pharyngitis, chronic cough, wheeze, globus sensation, oral ulcer and snore was significantly increased in subjects with SGER (P<0.01). Heavy smoking (OR=5.76; CI, 3.70-6.67), heavy alcohol use (OR=2.85; CI, 1.67-4.49), peptic ulcer (OR=5.76; CI, 3.99-8.32), cerebral palsy (OR=3.97; CI, 1.97-8.00), abdominal operation (OR=2.69; CI, 1.75-4.13), obesity (OR=2.16; CI, 1.47-3.16), excessive food intake (OR=1.43; CI, 1.17-1.15), sweet food (OR=1.23; CI, 0.89-1.54), and consumption of coffee (OR=1.23; CI, 0.17-2.00) were independently associated with SGER. The episodes of GERD were commonly precipitated by dietary factors (66.05%), followed by body posture (26.54%), ill temper (23.72%), fatigue (22.32%) and stress (10.93%). CONCLUSION: GERD is common in Xi'an's adult population with a mild or moderate degree. The etiology and pathogenesis of GERD are probably associated with FD, IBS, and some respiratory, laryngopharyngeal and odontostological diseases or symptoms. Some lifestyles, diseases and dietary factors are the risk factors of GERD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of evaluated treatments for recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children. METHODS: Online bibliographic databases were searched for the terms "recurrent abdominal pain," "functional abdominal pain," "children," or "alternative therapies" in articles classified as randomized controlled trials. The abstracts or full text of 57 relevant articles were examined; 10 of these met inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria required that the study involve children aged 5 to 18 years, subjects have a diagnosis of RAP, and that subjects were allocated randomly to treatment or control groups. The methodology and findings of these articles were evaluated critically, and data were extracted from each article regarding study methods, specific interventions, outcomes measured, and results. RESULTS: Studies that evaluated famotidine, pizotifen, cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and peppermint oil enteric-coated capsules showed a decrease in measured pain outcomes for those who received the interventions when compared with others in control groups. The studies that evaluated dietary interventions had conflicting results, in the case of fiber, or showed no efficacy, in the case of lactose avoidance. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for efficacy of treatment of RAP in children was found for therapies that used famotidine, pizotifen, cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and peppermint oil enteric-coated capsules. The effects of dietary fiber were less conclusive, and the use of a lactose-free diet showed no improvement. There seemed to be greater improvement when therapy (famotidine, pizotifen, peppermint oil) was targeted to the specific functional gastrointestinal disorder (dyspepsia, abdominal migraine, irritable bowel syndrome). The behavioral interventions seemed to have a general positive effect on children with nonspecific RAP. Many of these therapies have not been used widely as standard treatment for children with RAP. Although the mechanism of action for each effective therapy is not fully understood, each is believed to be safe for use in RAP.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To determine what constitutes usual medical care for irritable bowel syndrome, which patient characteristics influence choice of treatment and how satisfied patients are with care. METHODS: Patient encounters in a health maintenance organization were prospectively monitored to identify visits coded irritable bowel syndrome, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhoea. Within 2 weeks these patients were sent postal questionnaires (n = 1770, 59% participation) to assess patient characteristics and treatment recommendations. Responders were sent follow-up questionnaires 6 months later (77% participation) to assess adherence and satisfaction with treatment. RESULTS: Treatments employed most frequently were dietary advice, explanation, exercise advice, reassurance, advice to reduce stress and antispasmodic medications. Primary care physicians and gastroenterologists provided similar treatments. Patient confidence was higher for lifestyle advice (63-67, 100-point scale) than for medications (46-59). However, adherence was greater for medications (62-79 vs. 59-69, 100-point scale). Satisfactory relief was reported by 57%, but only 22% reported that symptom severity was reduced by half. Usual medical treatment was less effective for irritable bowel syndrome than for constipation, diarrhoea, or abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: Usual medical care for irritable bowel syndrome emphasizes education and lifestyle modification more than drugs; patients have a greater expectation of benefit from lifestyle modification than drugs. Overall 57% of irritable bowel syndrome patients report satisfactory relief.},

Dietary management of functional gastrointestinal conditions is an attractive therapeutic option for the patient and physician alike because it is safe and economical and empowers the patient to help themselves. However, in practice, dietary manipulation frequently yields rather disappointing results. Exclusion diets can be helpful, but are labor intensive and occasionally can be very restrictive. Laboratory testing for immunoglobulin E food antibodies usually is not helpful, except in a small subgroup of patients with diarrhea, predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and atopy. There is some preliminary evidence to suggest that elimination diets based on immunoglobulin G food antibody testing may possibly have therapeutic potential in IBS, but this requires confirmation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Previous studies with cisapride reported conflicting results in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). To gain further evidence, this randomized double-blind study was carried out. METHODS: Eighty-two symptomatic outpatients were randomized to receive either 5 mg oral cisapride or placebo three times daily for a period of 12 weeks. In patients without satisfactory improvement after 4 weeks, the dose was doubled. Symptom evaluation used visual analog scales (VAS) and the investigators' global assessment. RESULTS: After 4 weeks, in 18 (45%) cisapride and 24 (57%) placebo patients the dose was doubled because of insufficient improvement of symptoms. The mean VAS score for patients' global rating of IBS symptoms at baseline was 67.5 mm for cisapride versus 70.7 mm for placebo, and improved to 38.4 mm versus 44.5 mm after 12 weeks of treatment. Investigators rated the overall effect of therapy as good or excellent in 70% of the cisapride and 50% of the placebo group. Neither these nor further efficacy parameter differences reached statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the effect of 15-30 mg cisapride daily on symptoms of constipation-predominant IBS is not significantly superior to placebo. During the 12 week treatment of this trial cisapride proved to be safe and tolerable.},
