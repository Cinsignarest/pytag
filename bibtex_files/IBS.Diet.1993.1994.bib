   abstract = {Whilst following up large numbers of patients with irritable bowel syndrome we got the impression that wholemeal wheat and bran products made people with the condition worse rather than better. One hundred consecutive new referrals, all of whom had tried bran, were questioned to resolve this issue. 55% of patients were made worse by bran whereas only 10% had found it helpful. With the exception of fruit, other forms of dietary fibre were not as detrimental and proprietary supplements were found to be beneficial. All symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome were exacerbated by bran, with bowel disturbance most often adversely affected, followed by abdominal distension and pain. The results of this study suggest that the use of bran in irritable bowel syndrome should be reconsidered. The study also raises the possibility that excessive consumption of bran in the community may actually be creating patients with irritable bowel syndrome by exacerbating mild, non-complaining cases.},

This study extended these findings by recording fasting ambulatory motility from electronic strain gauge sensors sited in the jejunum and ileum of eight diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients and 12 healthy controls. During the day, periodicity of migrating motor complexes mean (SEM) did not differ between patients (92 (10) min) and controls (85 (7) min). At night, periodicity was shorter in both patients and controls, and the daytime dominance of phase II was replaced by phase I. In both groups, aboral progression of phase III fronts was associated with a slowing of propagation velocity and maximum contractile rate, but an increase in mean amplitude of contraction. Discrete clustered contractions were seen in seven patients and 10 controls occupying 14 and 16% of daytime phase II activity, respectively. Pain episodes were not associated with any specific motility patterns. Despite the lack of motility differences between the two groups, orocaecal transit time in the irritable bowel syndrome patients was shorter at 57 (9) min than in the controls, 82 (6) min (p < 0.05). This ambulant study has failed to show any abnormalities of fasting small intestinal motility that might distinguish diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients from healthy controls.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is recognized to be a common cause of chronic diarrhea without failure to thrive in childhood. Several studies stressed the role of food intolerance as a major factor in the pathogenesis of IBS. The aim of this multicenter study was to investigate the offending role of food in IBS and to compare the therapeutic role of oral sodium cromoglycate versus elimination diet. 153 patients (mean age 4 years) with diarrhea (> 3 stools per day for four days in a week) and abdominal pain for about 10 months were enrolled in this trial. About half of the patients had a family history positive for atopy and 70% of the cases complained of intestinal symptoms after food ingestion. In 17% of the patients Skin Prick test (SPT) resulted positive to at least one food allergen and 87% of positive reactions to SPT was provoked by common foodstuffs. 87% of patients treated with elimination diet (rice, lamb, turkey, lettuce, carrots, sweet potatoes, pears, oil, tea, salt, mineral water, brown sugar) and 97% of patients treated with SCG (mean 63 mg/kg/day) for one month showed a significant improvement of intestinal symptoms. An elimination diet for several weeks can produce, beside a bad compliance (23% of patients admitted to our study didn't strictly follow diet regimen) also a nutritional deprivation. The results of this trial suggest that it's correct to investigate the role of food in children with diarrhea not due to organic diseases and diagnosed such as IBS and to use oral SCG to obtain the improvement of these symptoms.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome and functional bowel disorder are diagnoses used to describe chronic GI symptoms for which no overt pathological condition can be identified. Symptoms are more common in women and are frequently followed in gastroenterology clinics. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the research linking GI symptoms and reproductive cycling and to discuss implications for practice. GI symptoms such as stomach pain and nausea are highest during menses compared with other cycle phases; also, stool consistency is loosest at menses. This pattern is present in control subjects. In women with irritable bowel syndrome the same pattern is seen but with higher symptom intensity. Although animal studies have demonstrated that estrogen and progesterone modulate contractile function of some GI segments, in humans, symptoms are highest when these hormones are at the lowest levels. Thus, symptoms in women may be related to decreasing ovarian hormone levels or to other circulating hormones or factors which vary with the menstrual cycle. Additionally, other factors such as stress aggravate symptoms. Therapeutics directed toward increasing patient awareness of cyclic patterns in symptom complaints, for example, via the use of daily symptom diaries may be a useful adjunct to dietary, pharmacological, and other therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: The importance of dietary fibres in treatment of irritable bowel syndrome increased during the last years. Yet the results of clinical studies on the different dietary fibres are not consistent. Therefore we decided to perform a controlled trial with a well defined group of patients to compare the effectiveness of wheat bran to psyllium seeds. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients each with irritable bowel syndrome group II to III were treated in an open, not controlled study design either with 3 times 3.25 g psyllium seeds or 3 times 7 g wheat bran daily. All patients entering the study had not been treated for at least 3 weeks before. The study comprised two treatment phases of two weeks each, separated by two weeks without any treatment, thus leading to a study duration of 6 weeks altogether. Parameters for evaluation were stool frequency and consistency and the symptoms pain and abdominal distention, measured by a score (1 to 4). RESULTS: In both treatments groups stool frequency and consistency improved apparently compared to the starting point or the two weeks treatment free time in between. The improvement of stool frequency was statistically significant (p < 0.0001) for both substances. Furthermore the effect of psyllium seeds exceeded that of wheat bran statistically significant in week 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 (p < 0.005). Other symptoms such as abdominal pain improved too by therapy, psyllium seeds again tending to show better results. A significant difference between both substances could be observed on the symptom abdominal distension. Whereas abdominal distension decreased under treatment with psyllium seeds it increased with wheat brain. This lead to discontinuation of the study in 5 cases, 3 of which could be changed successfully to psyllium seeds. The difference between psyllium seeds and wheat bran concerning the occurrence of abdominal distension was statistically significant (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of psyllium seeds and wheat bran on stool frequency and consistency of patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Psyllium seeds showed to be superior to wheat brain with respect to stool frequency and abdominal distension so that it should be preferred in treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and constipation.},

One therapeutic strategy is to increase dietary fiber intake and to eliminate gastrointestinal (GI) irritants such as caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco smoking. However, little work has been done to establish a relationship between dietary factors and chronic GI symptoms. In this article, the authors: (a) describe and compare caloric and dietary constituent intake in symptomatic (n = 18) and asymptomatic (n = 37) women, and (b) examine the relationships among diet, GI symptoms, and stool characteristics in the two groups. In particular, total calories, fiber, fat, protein, and carbohydrates as well as alcohol and caffeine intakes were compared in women who do not smoke. Because menstrual cycle phase modulates both symptoms and appetite, women were studied during the follicular phase. Groups had similar caloric, fat, and protein intakes. Fiber intakes were similar and similar to national norms in both groups. When compared with asymptomatic women, the symptomatic women consumed more refined carbohydrates. Relationships were observed among dietary intake of refined carbohydrates, fiber, GI symptoms, and stool characteristics in women with functional bowel disorder.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel is a functional gastrointestinal disorder with chronic or relapsing symptoms of abdominal pain and impaired frequency and consistency of the faeces caused by obscure structural or biochemical deviations. The frequency of the condition in civilized countries is estimated to amount to 15-20% of the population and it accounts for 25-50% of all patients in gastroenterological ambulatory departments. From the clinical aspect the type with dominant diarrhoea, typically in the morning and very compelling, and the type with pain and constipation are known but even combinations of the two types are encountered. A psychosomatic disorder of the motility of the large bowel and its tonus is involved associated with enhanced pain perception. Despite great efforts to find aetiopathogenetic factors, knowledge still is at the level of obscure theories. The diagnosis is still established per exclusion after all organic causes are ruled out, i.e. we always have to differentiate between an irritable bowel from an irritated one. In therapy the patient's confidence in his doctor is most important and it is essential to gain the patient's active cooperation. In case of diarrhoea a low-residue diet is used, calcium carbonate, codeine, loperamide, conversely in constipation adequate dietary fibre, intake metoclopramide or cisapride. Pain is relieved by spasmolytics or Ca channel blockers in the smooth musculature of the large bowel. The associated dysbiosis is transformed into eubiosis by Lactobacillus or other bacterial products.},

   abstract = {The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic functional disorder. Although its cause is unclear, a multifactorial etiology has been hypothesized with several putative pathophysiological mechanisms which may interact. These include abnormal intestinal motor function, abnormal visceral perception, psychosocial factors and luminal factors that irritate the small bowel and colon. A positive diagnosis should be made from an accurate history and physical examination and requires confirmation by exclusion of structural, metabolic and infectious processes that may result in similar clinical presentations. The IBS can be classified on the basis of its broad clinical spectrum of severity and variable patterns of dominant symptoms. Such a classification permits an appropriately graduated treatment approach that includes patient education, dietary adjustment, psychotherapeutic and behavioral techniques, as well as a symptom-orientated pharmaco- and psychopharmacotherapy. The majority of patients has mild symptoms and requires no specific treatment besides careful education and reassurance and dietary adjustment. For moderate symptom severity, additional psychotherapy and behavior techniques are indicated, which should be combined with pharmacotherapy targeted at the presumed pathomechanism. For severe symptoms, physician-based behavior modification and psychopharmacological agents may be needed.},

   abstract = {First, it is important to find out whether the patient is complaining of infrequent defaecation, excessive straining at defaecation, abdominal pain or bloating, a general sense of malaise attributed to constipation, soiling, or a combination of more than one symptom. Second, one must decide if there is a definable abnormality as a cause of the symptom(s). Is the colon apparently normal or is its lumen widened (megacolon)? Is the upper gut normal or is there evidence of neuropathy or myopathy? Is the ano-rectum normal or is there evidence of a weak pelvic floor, mucosal prolapse, major rectocele, an internal intussusception or solitary rectal ulcer? Is there any systemic component such as hypothyroidism, hypercalcaemia, neurological or psychiatric disorder or relevant drug therapy? Choice of treatment will depend on this clinical evaluation. The range of treatments available is: Reassurance and stop current treatment: Patients with a bowel obsession may take laxatives or rectal preparations regularly without need. Increase dietary fibre: Most cases of 'simple' constipation respond to increased dietary fibre, possibly with an added supplement of natural bran. Toilet training and altered routine of life: Young people particularly may need to recognise the call to stool and alter their daily routine to permit and encourage regular defaecation. Medicinal bulking agent: Ispaghula, methyl cellulose, concentrated wheat germ or bran, and similar preparations are useful when patients with a normal colon find it difficult to take adequate dietary fibre. These preparations increase the bulk of stool and soften its consistency. They may be useful for those patients with the constipated form of irritable bowel syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

This condition may result from decreased absorption of gastrointestinal contents or increased fluid secretion into the bowel. Although chronic diarrhea can have many etiologies, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, dietary factors, inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer are the causes most frequently encountered in primary care practice. An orderly work-up, beginning with a complete history an a thorough physical examination, is essential. Whenever possible, treatment should be directed at the underlying cause of the diarrheal condition. If the diarrhea persists and the etiology remains obscure, administration of opiates or bile-sequestering agents often is helpful in alleviating symptoms. New approaches to decreasing secretions, such as the use of clonidine therapy, are being studied.},

Approximately half of the flocks were fed on either a high (178 IU/kg) or normal (48 IU/kg) vitamin E-containing diet. In addition, in approximately half of the flocks subclinical infectious bursal disease (IBD) was present. Analysis of the performance data demonstrated that flocks with subclinical IBD were consistently worse (P< 0.001) for net income, feed conversion ratio and average weight per bird than flocks without the subclinical disease. The trial also indicated that the average net income of flocks with subclinical IBD and fed a high vitamin E-containing diet was 10% better (P < 0.05) than flocks with subclinical IBD and fed a normal vitamin E-containing diet. However, the trial also demonstrated that the difference between the average net income achieved by flocks without subclinical IBD and being fed on either a high or a normal vitamin E-containing diet was only 2% and not significantly different. It is suggested that the increased improved performance from high vitamin E-containing diets recorded in flocks with subclinical IBS is due to enhanced immunocompetence and increased resistance to disease. It is also suggested that under field conditions, high dietary inputs of vitamin E are most beneficial where there is a challenge to the host's defence system and significantly improved performance will occur more predictably under such conditions.},

   abstract = {When no identifiable organic cause for colonic symptoms can be found, it is easy for the busy clinician to label the patient neurotic. It is evident that many of these "functional" disorders do reflect an underlying motility disorder, although our understanding is far from clear. However, currently, patients with severe constipation are evaluated in a much more rational manner and, as a consequence, are offered a reasonable therapeutic approach that can be predicted to have a good chance for success. We can hope that as our understanding of irritable bowel syndrome is strengthened, treatment will become more efficacious than the unproved and costly medications that are in use currently. Until dietary modification becomes commonplace, it is unlikely that the incidence of diverticular disease or its complications will change. Already, our understanding of ileus has allowed us to realize the benefits of laparoscopic surgery, and as our knowledge of the various gut hormones and the inhibitory role that some play in intestinal motility grows, ileus, and its resulting prolongation of hospital stay, may become less problematic.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome is a very common clinical problem with a broad spectrum of severity. The management includes a combination of positive diagnosis of typical symptoms with limited investigations to exclude underlying structural or biochemical disorders. Therapeutic trials focus on the relief of predominant symptoms. Identification and modification of factors exacerbating symptoms, behavioural techniques and pharmacologic agents directed to the presumed gastrointestinal motor dysfunction are required. Psychological support by the physician is the most important part of treatment. Chronic constipation may be the predominant symptom of irritable bowel syndrome. Underlying organic disorders must be excluded by clinical examination and endoscopy. Severe chronic constipation requires further investigation of colonic motility and defecation. High fibre diet, osmotic laxatives and procinetic agents may lead to an improvement. In rare cases surgery may be indicated.},

   abstract = {The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by alimentary and non-alimentary symptoms; the aim of this study was to assess the clinical value and discriminant function of non-alimentary symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome. Alimentary and non-alimentary symptoms, estimated daily dietary fibre intakes, ability to express personal feelings, anxiety and depression ratings, and life events and difficulties inventories were compared in 128 hospital out-patients with IBS and 113 age and sex matched control subjects not seeking health care, randomly recruited from the community. Alimentary symptoms correlated closely with those non-alimentary symptoms often associated with the hyperventilation syndromes, difficulties in expressing personal feelings and anxiety, and depression ratings. Life events and difficulties, and estimated daily dietary fibre intakes did not differ significantly between patients and controls. With the exception of abdominal bloating, no significant gender differences were observed in IBS symptoms in either the IBS or control groups. The irritable bowel syndrome is one facet of a more general condition of illness behaviour which includes the hyperventilation syndrome and an inassertiveness in expressing personal feelings. Though non-alimentary symptoms did not improve diagnostic accuracy beyond that achieved by a combination of alimentary symptoms, their recognition provides alternative approaches to the management of refractory IBS.},

The aims of this study were to evaluate the usual of colonoscopy in the French area of Aquitaine and to determinate the factors associated with a procedure of good quality. Thirty four gastroenterologists prospectively recorded indications, conditions of practice and results of the colonoscopies that were performed during 4 consecutive weeks. Six hundred and eighty six colonoscopies were analysed, performed in 387 women and 299 men, mean age: 59.9 years. INDICATIONS: irritable bowel syndrome: 34%, patients belonging to high risk groups: 30%, recent transit disturbance: 27%, rectal bleeding: 23%, positive fecal occult blood test: 4.3%. Preparations: polyethylene glycol (PEG) 78%, in 2 doses: 20%; PEG alone: 43%, associated with enemas and laxatives: 19%, with enemas: 14%, with laxatives: 2%; minimum-residue diet before colonoscopy: 58%. The caecum was reached in 86% of colonoscopies. Ninety-nine colonoscopies were incomplete. Fifty one per cent of colonoscopies reached the caecum with visualization of total colic mucosa, 35% reached the caecum with one at least imperfectly seen colic area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Dietary fibre prescription, compliance and efficacy were documented in the IBS group. There were significant differences in the frequency of defaecation and number of symptoms present between the two groups. Most of the IBS subjects had been prescribed a high fibre diet but adherence to the diet and symptomatic improvement were poor. In contrast many IBS sufferers were following a range of diets not prescribed by their doctor. The seriousness of the IBS condition was highlighted by the fact that 8% of the IBS group had retired early due to their condition.},

We found it in 33 of 55 patients (60%) with chronic non-specific abdominal symptoms. Follow-up examinations after 15 months (mean) exhibited that lactose-free diet relieved symptoms in 57% of these patients completely or nearly completely. In contrast, only 12% of the patients without lactose malabsorption showed equal amelioration on the various unspecific diets and medications. The lactose-free diet succeeded particularly in young patients and patients with a short history of complaints. Therefore, we recommend lactose-H2-breath test in all patients with suspected irritable bowel syndrome for optimizing therapy.},

   abstract = {In the irritable bowel syndrome gastrointestinal tract motility is disturbed from the esophagus to the colon, causing pain and altered function. When colonic motility is abnormal, the patient can experience either constipation or diarrhea in addition to abdominal pain and bloating. In constipated patients the postprandial colonic motility can increase normally after eating or the colon can remain motionless. Generally propagating contractions are absent in patients with constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Propagating contractions are increased in frequency in patients with diarrhea, although the phasic contractions are decreased. Questionnaires discriminate between patients with structural disease such as ulcerative colitis and patients with functional disease, however they cannot differentiate between the different subgroups of patients with constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Treatment strategies are beginning to focus on the underlying pathophysiologic abnormality.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome remains the commonest reason for referral to a gastroenterology clinic. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome are frequently advised to increase their intake of bran fibre, despite inconclusive experimental evidence of benefit. METHODS: The effect of dietary supplementation with a bolus of bran fibre (12 g/day) was studied in a block-randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 80 patients with irritable bowel syndrome referred to a District General Hospital outpatient clinic. Comparison of the benefits of bran and placebo was based upon personal assessment of individual and overall symptom profiles, determined from a simple daily symptom score and post-treatment interview. RESULTS: Overall symptomatic improvement was reported with bran by 52% and with placebo by 54% of patients. Bran supplementation was no more effective than placebo in improving individual symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and for wind-related symptoms it was significantly less effective (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Dietary supplementation with bran is of no value in the treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome referred to a hospital clinic.},

METHODS: Diet and gastrointestinal symptom questionnaires were completed by 93 randomly selected runners and 95 age, sex matched sedentary controls. RESULTS: The runners ate more fibre and had more frequent bowel movements which were more often loose or urgent. They had less constipation but there was no difference in the use of laxatives or the prevalence of the irritable bowel syndrome. Although most runners tried to empty their bowels before running, the urgent need to have a bowel movement was still the most common reason for a runner to stop during a run. Heartburn, vomiting and bloating were more common when not training while retching, stitches and fecal incontinence were more common when running. Few runners ate before running and upper gastrointestinal symptoms while running were rare. CONCLUSIONS: Lower gastrointestinal symptoms may be caused by running or the running lifestyle. Upper gastrointestinal symptoms are not due to running alone.},
