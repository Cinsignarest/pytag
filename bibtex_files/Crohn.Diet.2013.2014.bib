   abstract = {We attempted, through systematic review to explore the epidemiology and risk factors of Crohn's disease (CD) with special attention to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). We selected articles that contained population-based, epidemiological, and clinical character studies of CD. We collected data concerned with the prevalence, demographic features, and the possible etiology of CD that might explain its emergence in KSA. The prevalence of CD in Western countries ranged between 11-43/100,000 with flawless evidence of CD prevalence emerging in previously low incidence areas like Asia. Prevalence in KSA has markedly increased over the last 3 decades. Combined ileal and colonic involvement was the most frequently affected site. Diet, smoking, drugs, and westernization of life are assumed to contribute to the pathogenesis. There is convincing evidence of CD emerging in Asia, including KSA. Westernization of lifestyle and smoking is probably the major contributing factors. Genetic studies are warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are 2 common inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) associated with intestinal inflammation and tissue damage. Oxidative stress is suggested to play a major role in the initiation and progression of IBD. Vitamin C (ascorbate, ascorbic acid) supplementation has reduced oxidative stress in persons with IBD. The role of ascorbate transporters in IBD remains to be determined. SLC23A1 is a major ascorbate transporter in the intestinal tract, and some of its genetic variants have been associated with severely decreased ascorbate transport and lower systemic concentrations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether common genetic variants in the vitamin C transporter SLC23A1 are associated with the risk of IBD. DESIGN: Genomic DNA samples from patients with CD (n = 162) and UC (n = 149) from the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study and ethnically matched controls (n = 142) were genotyped for 3 SLC23A1 polymorphisms (rs6596473, rs33972313, and rs10063949) by using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Variation at rs10063949 (G allele for heterozygote and homozygote) was associated with increased susceptibility to CD (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.38, 4.66; OR: 4.72; 95% CI: 2.53, 8.81; P < 0.0001; respectively). A strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed across the SLC23A1 region (variation rs6596473 with rs10063949) for CD and UC (D' = 0.94 and 0.96, respectively). The risk alleles confirmed a haplotype (CGG) that is carried more in CD patients (65.3%, P < 0.0001) than in controls (43.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A genetic variant (rs10063949-G) in the SLC23A1 ascorbate transporter locus was identified and is associated with an increased risk of CD in a white Canadian IBD cohort. The presented evidence that SLC23A1 variations can modulate the risk of CD has implications for understanding ascorbate transport in CD patients and provides a novel opportunity toward individualized nutritional therapy for patients carrying the disease-associated genotype.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic immunologically mediated diseases that often have a relapsing-remitting course in young persons. Genetic-risk polymorphisms explain less than one third of the heritability of disease. Epidemiologic and laboratory data suggest that environmental factors play a significant role in influencing the risk and natural history of disease. Smoking is the most widely and consistently described risk factor. It, however, increases the risk of CD while conferring protection against UC. The gut microbiome is a key component in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Several external factors potentially exert an effect by influencing the composition of the gut microbiome or disrupting the intestinal barrier. These external influences include the use of antibiotics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the presence of enteric infections. Data on diet have been inconsistent, but high fiber intake, particularly of soluble fiber, appears to protect against CD, whereas protein intake may increase disease risk. Vitamin D may also play an important protective role, particularly in patients with CD. Neurobehavioral factors, such as stress and depression, also influence the risk of IBD. Systematic and rigorous studies of environmental exposures in the management of IBD are needed. In particular, studies of whether environmental factors can be modified to reduce the likelihood of relapse or improve patient outcomes would be valuable.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD; Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC)] are chronic immunologically mediated diseases that are due to a dysregulated immune response to intestinal flora in a genetically susceptible host. Despite advances in genetics, the likelihood of occurrence of disease remains incompletely explained and there appears to be a strong role for the environment in mediating risk of disease. Smoking remains the most widely studied and replicated risk factor, contributing to increased risk and severity of CD while conferring protection against UC. Recent data has suggested novel risk factors. Lower plasma vitamin D is associated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease, and vitamin D supplementation may prevent relapse of disease. Several medications including oral contraceptives, post-menopausal hormone replacement, aspirin, NSAIDs, and antibiotics may increase risk of CD or UC with the mechanisms of effect remaining inadequately defined. There is continuing evidence that depression and psychosocial stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of both CD and UC, while at the same time also increasing risk for disease flares. There is also a growing understanding of the role of diet on IBD, in particular through its effect on the microbiome. Animal protein intake and n-6 fatty acids may increase risk of UC while n-3 fatty acids and dietary fiber may confer protection. The effect of diet on established disease remains poorly studied. There is need for routine measurement of a spectrum of environmental exposures in prospective studies to further our understanding.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic immunologically mediated diseases. The key mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of these diseases is a dysregulated immune response to commensal flora in a genetically susceptible host. Thus intestinal microbial dysbiosis, host genetics, and the external environment all play an important role in the development of incident disease and in determining subsequent disease behavior and outcomes. There are several well-defined or putative environmental risk factors including cigarette smoking, appendectomy, diet, stress and depression, vitamin D as well as hormonal influence. The effect of some of the risk factors appears to differ between CD and UC suggesting that despite shared genetic and immunologic mechanisms, distinct pathways of pathogenesis exist. There is a growing body of literature identifying risk factors for incident disease. There is less rigorous literature defining triggers of relapse, and few controlled clinical trials examining if modification of such risk factors results in an improvement in patient outcomes. This is an area of considerable patient, physician, and scientific interest, and there is an important unmet need for rigorous studies of the external environment in disease pathogenesis and subsequent course.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Dietary fats influence intestinal inflammation and regulate mucosal immunity. Data on the association between dietary fat and risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are limited and conflicting. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study cohorts. Diet was prospectively ascertained every 4 years using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Self-reported CD and UC were confirmed through medical record review. We examined the effect of energy-adjusted cumulative average total fat intake and specific types of fat and fatty acids on the risk of CD and UC using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 170,805 women, we confirmed 269 incident cases of CD (incidence 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 incident cases of UC (incidence 10/100,000 person-years) over 26 years and 3,317,338 person-years of follow-up. Cumulative energy-adjusted intake of total fat, saturated fats, unsaturated fats, n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were not associated with risk of CD or UC. However, greater intake of long-chain n-3 PUFAs was associated with a trend towards lower risk of UC (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01). In contrast, high long-term intake of trans-unsaturated fatty acids was associated with a trend towards an increased incidence of UC (HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.92). CONCLUSIONS: A high intake of dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs may be associated with a reduced risk of UC. In contrast, high intake of trans-unsaturated fats may be associated with an increased risk of UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Increased intake of dietary fiber has been proposed to reduce the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]). However, few prospective studies have examined associations between long-term intake of dietary fiber and risk of incident CD or UC. METHODS: We collected and analyzed data from 170,776 women, followed up over 26 years, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, followed up for 3,317,425 person-years. Dietary information was prospectively ascertained via administration of a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire every 4 years. Self-reported CD and UC were confirmed through review of medical records. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for potential confounders, were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: We confirmed 269 incident cases of CD (incidence, 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 cases of UC (incidence, 10/100,000 person-years). Compared with the lowest quintile of energy-adjusted cumulative average intake of dietary fiber, intake of the highest quintile (median of 24.3 g/day) was associated with a 40% reduction in risk of CD (multivariate HR for CD, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.90). This apparent reduction appeared to be greatest for fiber derived from fruits; fiber from cereals, whole grains, or legumes did not modify risk. In contrast, neither total intake of dietary fiber (multivariate HR, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.17) nor intake of fiber from specific sources appeared to be significantly associated with risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: Based on data from the Nurses' Health Study, long-term intake of dietary fiber, particularly from fruit, is associated with lower risk of CD but not UC. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms that mediate this association.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are chronic immunologically mediated diseases of the gut. Advances in genetics have revolutionized our understanding of the pathogenesis of these conditions with 163 risk loci identified, encompassing a variety of immunologic functions. There is substantial heterogeneity in the natural history of these diseases with respect to disease onset, course, and progression to complications. There are also significant variations in response to therapies and susceptibility to therapy-related and disease-related complications. An important need in the field is to identify predictors of disease course, complications, and likelihood of response and adverse events to allow for targeted therapeutic decision making. The genotype of an individual in constant and non-modifiable, and thus could potentially fulfill the role of important predictors of these outcomes. In this review, we discuss the existing literature on the prediction of various disease phenotypes in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis using underlying genotype. We also identify gaps in the literature and suggest future directions for research. There is need for large, multi-institutional, and international collaborative consortia with efficient and detailed cohort accrual, phenotypic definition, genotyping, and dynamic assessments of external (e.g., diet) and internal (microbiome) environment to allow us to progress toward personalized and precision medicine in the management of these complex diseases.},

Histopathological analysis of biopsy specimens from the ileum and descending colon showed non-caseating epithelioid cell granuloma. On the basis of these findings, the condition of the patient was diagnosed as ileocolonic Crohn's disease, and the patient received parenteral nutrition, followed by elemental diet.

METHODS: 205 CD patients of a referral hospital were enrolled between January1998-January 2010 when measurement of BMD by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was available. Follow-up DXA scan was performed in subjects with known risk factors besides Crohn indicative for low BMD. Treatment of CD patients was according to a protocol which is comparable to the current (inter)national guidelines. In osteopenic patients, supplemental vitamin D (800 IU) and Calcium (500-1000 mg) were prescribed. RESULTS: Mean BMD at baseline was 0.97 +/- 0.16 gram/cm(2) in lumbar spine and 0.87 +/- 0.12 gram/cm(2) in the total hip. At baseline, higher age and low Body Mass Index (BMI), were negatively correlated with BMD. Eighty-four patients underwent a second BMD assessment with a median interval period of 4 years (IQR 3-6). A mean annual increase of +0.76% (95%CI: -2.63%; +3.87%) in lumbar spine and +0.43% (95%CI: -2.65% ; +1.11%) in total hip was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Higher age, male sex, low BMI, and a higher age at diagnosis of CD were associated with low BMD. Follow-up of BMD in CD patients showed a contraintuitive small increase of BMD at lumbar spine and total hip in CD patients only using supplemental vitamin D and calcium next to strict treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: A major use of breath hydrogen testing is to assess absorptive capacity for sugars to assist dietary design for management of gut symptoms. Qualitative reporting takes no account of the vigor of hydrogen response and provides little insight into degrees of malabsorption. This study aimed to describe a semiquantitative reporting method and to compare results with those reported qualitatively. METHODS: In consecutive Caucasian patients with Crohn's disease (n = 87), ulcerative colitis (59), functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) (162), and healthy controls (76), area under the curve was calculated for lactulose (15 g). This was compared with that for lactose (50 g) and fructose (35 g). Degree of malabsorption was categorized into arbitrary groups. RESULTS: Semiquantitative results for >/= 30% (designated "convincing") malabsorption was most similar to those using a qualitative cutoff value of 20 ppm, but in 38% and 21% of patients, the classification of malabsorption (nil or clinically significant) changed for fructose and lactose, respectively. Using a cutoff of 10 ppm, 49% and 5% were classified differently. Crohn's disease had a higher prevalence (42%) of convincing fructose malabsorption than controls (24%) or patients with FGID (33%) (P < 0.02). Highest prevalence of convincing lactose malabsorption (38%) was in ulcerative colitis, greater than controls (18%) and FGID (18%) (P < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Semiquantitative assessment provides different results with different clinical implications in more than one third of patients, but disease-related alterations in prevalence are similar to those defined qualitatively. This method may be preferable because it lessens the confounding influence of the vigor of the hydrogen response.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low serum vitamin D levels may provoke or aggravate Crohn's disease (CrD). Vitamin D3 is a well-known immune modulator that affects immune functions in vitro and may prevent CrD flares. Dendritic cells (DC) are key mediators of vitamin D3 effects. In this study, we describe changes in monocyte-derived DC (mo-DC) maturation marker expression and cytokine production following 26 weeks of oral vitamin D3 supplementation in CrD patients. METHODS: Ten CrD patients who had increased serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels after oral vitamin D3 and calcium treatment and ten seasonally matched placebo-treated patients were selected for this study. Mo-DC were generated before and after the 26 weeks and induced to mature upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Maturation marker expression and cytokine production were analysed. Mo-DC function was analysed in a mixed leucocyte reaction (MLR). RESULTS: Compared with baseline values, LPS-matured mo-DC exhibited reduced expression of CD80 and reduced production of the cytokines IL-10, IL-1beta, and IL-6 following 26 weeks of oral vitamin D3 supplementation. Mo-DC performance in an allogeneic MLR was unchanged after vitamin D3 supplementation. Treatment with the placebo did not affect maturation markers, cytokine production, or the MLR. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D3 treatment in CrD patients led to hypo-responsive LPS-stimulated mo-DC. This finding indicates that vitamin D3 levels have an impact on the monocytic precursors of mo-DC in vivo and may explain the positive effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on CrD patients. Alternatively, CrD patients with high serum vitamin D3 levels may represent a subgroup with low disease activity.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized as a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Current consensus surrounding the cause of the disease suggests a complex interplay between genetic susceptibility, the intestinal microbiome and environmental factors, leading to the aberrant Th1 and Th17 immune cell mediated response. Vitamin D deficiency is common in CD patients, and long-standing deficiency has been associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD). Accumulating evidence now suggests that in addition to maintaining skeletal integrity, vitamin D also plays an integral role in regulating the general immune response, a function employed via its genomic actions on the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The VDR is expressed in all immune cells and both directly and indirectly targeted by the bioactive form of vitamin D, 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D). Impaired regulation or deficiency of the vitamin has been linked to the promotion of self-reactive T cell development, loss of immune tolerance to self-structures, and experimental colitis in animal models, whereas the subsequent administration of the vitamin in these models resulted in the improvement of immune-mediated symptoms. In addition, low vitamin D has been associated with disease activity in CD patients, and supplementation appears to be beneficial in improving clinical scores and reducing inflammation. Therefore, the primary aims of this article were to review the molecular evidence supporting the immunoregulatory roles of vitamin D and its supplementation in the CD patient, based on existing literature. The physiological processes, accepted serum concentration values, and its well-recognized role in bone health were also summarized.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental factors during childhood are thought to play a role in the aetiolgy of Crohn's Disease (CD). However the association between age at time of exposure and the subsequent development of CD in South Africa is unknown. METHODS: A case control study of all consecutive CD patients seen at 2 large inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) referral centers in the Western Cape, South Africa between September 2011 and January 2013 was performed. Numerous environmental exposures during 3 age intervals; 0-5, 6-10 and 11-18 years were extracted using an investigator administered questionnaire. An agreement analysis was performed to determine the reliability of questionnaire data for all the relevant variables. RESULTS: This study included 194 CD patients and 213 controls. On multiple logistic regression analysis, a number of childhood environmental exposures during the 3 age interval were significantly associated with the risk of developing CD. During the age interval 6-10 years, never having had consumed unpasteurized milk (OR = 5.84; 95% CI, 2.73-13.53) and never having a donkey, horse, sheep or cow on the property (OR = 2.48; 95% CI, 1.09-5.98) significantly increased the risk of developing future CD. During the age interval 11-18 years, an independent risk-association was identified for; never having consumed unpasteurized milk (OR = 2.60; 95% CI, 1.17-6.10) and second-hand cigarette smoke exposure (OR = 1.93; 95% CI, 1.13-3.35). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that both limited microbial exposures and exposure to second-hand cigarette smoke during childhood is associated with future development of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inter-racial differences in disease characteristics and in the management of Crohn's disease (CD) have been described in African American and Asian subjects, however for the racial groups in South Africa, no such recent literature exists. METHODS: A cross sectional study of all consecutive CD patients seen at 2 large inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) referral centers in the Western Cape, South Africa between September 2011 and January 2013 was performed. Numerous demographic and clinical variables at diagnosis and date of study enrolment were identified using an investigator administered questionnaire as well as clinical examination and patient case notes. Using predefined definitions, disease behavior was stratified as 'complicated' or 'uncomplicated'. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety four CD subjects were identified; 35 (18%) were white, 152 (78%) were Cape Coloured and 7(4%) were black. On multiple logistic regression analysis Cape Coloureds were significantly more likely to develop 'complicated' CD (60% vs. 9%, p = 0.023) during the disease course when compared to white subjects. In addition, significantly more white subjects had successfully discontinued cigarette smoking at study enrolment (31% vs. 7% reduction, p = 0.02). No additional inter-racial differences were found. A low proportion of IBD family history was observed among the non-white subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Cape Coloured patients were significantly more likely to develop 'complicated' CD over time when compared to whites.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk of new or recurrent cancer among patients with IBD and previous cancer, exposed or not to immunosuppressants. DESIGN: Among the 17 047 patients of the CESAME prospective observational cohort who were enrolled from May 2004 to June 2005, and followed-up until December 2007, we identified 405 patients with cancer diagnosed previous to study entry. We calculated the rates of incident cancer in patients with or without previous cancer, and we assessed by survival analysis and nested case-control study the impact of immunosuppressants on the risk of incident new or recurrent cancer in patients with previous cancer. RESULTS: The rate of incident cancer was 21.1/1000 patient-years (PY) and 6.1/1000 PY in patients with and without previous cancer, respectively. The multivariate-adjusted HR of incident cancer between patients with and without previous cancer was 1.9 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.0, p=0.003). Among patients with previous cancer, the rates of new and recurrent cancers were, respectively, 13.2/1000 PY and 6.0/1000 PY in the 312 patients who were not taking immunosuppressant at the time of study entry, and 23.1/1000 PY and 3.9/1000 PY in the 93 patients treated with immunosuppressants at study entry. There was no significant association between the exposure to immunosuppressants and the risk of new or recurrent cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD with a history of cancer are at increased risk of developing any (new or recurrent) cancer, with a predominant incidence of new cancers. Treatment with immunosuppressants has no overall major impact per se on this risk.},

   abstract = {Microparticles are small (<1 microm), nonbiological particles that are used in many areas of daily life. As food additive they are used as anticaking agents or food colorants. The most common food-derived ingested compounds are aluminium silicate and titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), the latter being a white pigment used in toothpaste or sugar toppings. The increasing abundance of microparticles in the Western diet raises the question of the potential risks associated with gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease (CD). Accumulation of particles has been shown in cells of Peyer's patches, but it is not clear whether this also has pathological effects. NLRP3 is a member of the intracellular pattern recognition receptor family and it is part of the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex containing caspase-1 which activates the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18. With regard to recent findings identifying small particles such as asbestos and monosodium urate as NLRP3 activators, TiO(2) may be another potential target for inflammasome studies. We found that macrophage-like cells readily take up TiO(2) after 6 h. Incubation of cells with TiO(2) resulted in the assembly of NLRP3 with caspase-1. This inflammasome assembly correlated with secretion of IL-1beta. In intestinal epithelial cells, TiO(2) also was found to be ingested. The counting of particles localized intracellularly revealed a dose-dependent increase of TiO(2)-positive cells. This points to the fact that in humans with a leaky intestinal barrier (such as IBD patients), TiO(2) microparticles may be taken up by macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells, may activate the inflammasome and induce IL-1beta and IL-18 secretion. This may aggravate inflammation in susceptible individuals.},

   abstract = {As inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to emerge with rising prevalence rates in the developed world and rising incidence rates in the developing world, it has become clear that environmental factors play a critical role in disease etiology. While no single environmental factor has been proven to have a definite causative role, there are several leading candidates. Smoking has been shown to adversely impact on the course of Crohn's disease (CD), but is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause CD. Considering that the countries with the highest smoking rates in the world have among the lowest rates of CD, it is more likely that smoking modulates CD once it is present as opposed to being directly causative. Diet likely plays a role, perhaps by modulating the gut microbiome directly or indirectly by impacting on the gut immune homeostasis. Antibiotics have become ubiquitously prescribed in the developed world and their emergence coincided with the emergence of IBD in the middle of the 20th century. Antibiotic use is also increasing in the developing world, and perhaps by modulating the gut microbiome this may be facilitating the emergence of IBD where it was rare 40 years ago. Finally, personal stress has intestinal physiological and immunological effects and is assuming an increasing role in the management of IBD.},

   abstract = {The dysbiosis theory of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) posits that there is an alteration in the gut microbiome as an important underpinning of disease etiology. It stands to reason then, that administering agents that could impact on the balance of microbes on the gut could be impactful on the course of IBD. Herein is a review of the controlled trials undertaken to assess the use of antibiotics that would kill or suppress potentially injurious microbes, probiotics that would overpopulate the gut with potentially beneficial microbes or prebiotics that provide a metabolic substrate that enhances the growth of potentially beneficial microbes. With regard to antibiotics, the best data are for the use of nitroimadoles postoperatively in Crohn's disease (CD) to prevent disease recurrence. Otherwise, the data are limited with the regard to any lasting benefit of antibiotics sustaining remission in either CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). A recent meta-analysis concluded that antibiotics are superior to placebo at inducing remission in CD or UC, although the meta-analysis grouped a variety of antibiotics with different spectra of activity. Despite the absence of robust clinical trial data, antibiotics are widely used to treat perineal fistulizing CD and acute and chronic pouchitis. Probiotics have not been shown to have a beneficial role in CD. However, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 has comparable effects to low doses of mesalamine in maintaining remission in UC. VSL#3, a combination of 8 microbes, has been shown to have an effect in inducing remission in UC and preventing pouchitis. Prebiotics have yet to be shown to have an effect in any form of IBD, but to date controlled trials have been small. The use of antibiotics should be balanced against the risks they pose. Even probiotics may pose some risk and should not be assumed to be innocuous especially when ingested by persons with a compromised epithelial barrier. Prebiotics may not be harmful but may cause gastrointestinal side effects. Finally, the timing of ingestion of antibiotics and other dietary factors that may function as prebiotics, especially in early childhood, may be critical in shaping the gut microbiome and ultimately predisposing to or preventing IBD. Finding ways to impact on the gut microbiome to alter the course of IBD makes good sense, but should be undertaken in the setting of rigorously performed controlled trials to ensure that the interventions are truly effective and well tolerated.},

   abstract = {Regular consumption of moderate doses of wine is an integral part of the Mediterranean diet, which has long been considered to provide remarkable health benefits. Wine's beneficial effect has been attributed principally to its non-alcoholic portion, which has antioxidant properties, and contains a wide variety of phenolics, generally called polyphenols. Wine phenolics may prevent or delay the progression of intestinal diseases characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation, especially because they reach higher concentrations in the gut than in other tissues. They act as both free radical scavengers and modulators of specific inflammation-related genes involved in cellular redox signaling. In addition, the importance of wine polyphenols has recently been stressed for their ability to act as prebiotics and antimicrobial agents. Wine components have been proposed as an alternative natural approach to prevent or treat inflammatory bowel diseases. The difficulty remains to distinguish whether these positive properties are due only to polyphenols in wine or also to the alcohol intake, since many studies have reported ethanol to possess various beneficial effects. Our knowledge of the use of wine components in managing human intestinal inflammatory diseases is still quite limited, and further clinical studies may afford more solid evidence of their beneficial effects.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is one of the five most prevalent gastrointestinal disease burdens in the US, with an overall health care cost of more than USD 1.7 billion. It commonly requires a lifetime of care, and accounts for more than 700,000 physician visits, 100,000 hospitalizations, and disability in 119,000 patients each year. IBD is a multifactorial disease and comprises genetic susceptibility, uncontrolled immune responses, and environmental factors which play a role in the pathogenesis and course of the disease. IBD patients are lifelong on medication, either for induction or maintenance therapy. Current treatment option (corticosteroids, immune suppressants, biologics), administered in mono- or combination therapy, are still unsatisfactory. Due to the nature of disease, 20-40% of patients relapse within the first 12 months. Although modern treatment algorithms have diminished the risk of surgery, the treatments harbor significant side effects, which impacts patients' quality of life. The role of nutrition in IBD has gathered high interest, especially in pediatric Crohn's disease, where studies have shown that exclusive enteral nutrition can induce remission in mild-to-moderate disease comparable to corticosteroids. Thus, gastroenterologists and patients become increasingly aware that specific nutritional interventions offered in addition to the standard of care are an appealing option for a safe long-term disease management. Such specific nutritional solutions should be based on scientific/clinical evidence and specifically designed to address the patients' distinct nutritional requirements. As per definition, these nutrition products fall under the regulatory framework of a Medical Food (Foods for Special Medical Purposes in Europe).},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Calcium deficiency is considered a risk factor for the development of osteoporosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Various dietary restrictions, including milk products are reported by these patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate dairy product and dietary calcium intake by IBD patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 65 outpatients with IBD recruited from one reference center for IBD. A semi-structured questionnaire (to collect demographic, socioeconomic and clinical data) and a quantitative food frequency questionnaire were administered. With regard to clinical data, we evaluated the anthropometric nutritional status, the disease classification, the disease activity index and the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Self-reported modifications in the use of dairy products were evaluated. RESULTS: The IBD patients' ages ranged from 20-75 years and 67.0% were diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. The majority (64.7%) reported restricting dairy products. The frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms was higher among the Crohn's disease patients who restricted dairy products than among those with no restrictions (100% vs 42.9%; p = 0.013); this result was not observed among the UC (ulcerative colitis) patients. Disease activity was also more frequent in the IBD patients who restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (23.8% vs 4.5%; p = 0.031), and among the UC patients, extensive disease was more common in the patients who restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (42.9% vs 20.0%; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Restricting dairy products is common among IBD patients, possibly due to disease activity, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the extension of the disease.},

   abstract = {Dietary methyl donors and their genetic determinants are associated with Crohn's disease risk. We investigated whether a methyl-deficient diet (MDD) may affect development and functions of the small intestine in rat pups from dams subjected to the MDD during gestation and lactation. At 1 month before pregnancy, adult females were fed with either a standard food or a diet without vitamin B12, folate and choline. A global wall hypotrophy was observed in the distal small bowel (MDD animals 0.30 mm v. controls 0.58 mm; P< 0.001) with increased crypt apoptosis (3.37 v. 0.4%; P< 0.001), loss of enterocyte differentiation in the villus and a reduction in intestinal alkaline phosphatase production. Cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining (MDD animals 3.37% v. controls 0.4%, P< 0.001) and the Apostain labelling index showed increased crypt apoptosis (3.5 v. 1.4%; P= 0.018). Decreased proliferation was observed in crypts of the proximal small bowel with a reduced number of minichromosome maintenance 6 (MDD animals 52.83% v. controls 83.17%; P= 0.048) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells (46.25 v. 59 %; P= 0.05). This lack of enterocyte differentiation in the distal small bowel was associated with an impaired expression of beta-catenin and a decreased beta-catenin-E-cadherin interaction. The MDD affected the intestinal barrier in the proximal small bowel by decreasing Paneth cell number after immunostaining for lysosyme (MDD animals 8.66% v. controls 21.66%) and by reducing goblet cell number and mucus production after immunostaining for mucin-2 (crypts 8.66 v. 15.33%; villus 7 v. 17%). The MDD has dual effects on the small intestine by producing dramatic effects on enterocyte differentiation and barrier function in rats.},

This article offers findings from a study that used four semistructured audiorecorded interviews during a 4-week time period for the purpose of exploring the experiences of 11 individuals before and after receiving dietary fiber information from a healthcare professional. The first and second interviews occurred immediately before and after the presentation of information. Follow-up interviews occurred at 2-week intervals. Thematic analysis of the baseline interviews revealed 2 themes: (a) accepting a redefined (lower expectations) definition of normal quality of life and (b) continuing to look for answers. Three themes emerged from the follow-up interviews at Week 4: (a) reevaluating old diet-related concepts, (b) enjoying a healthier lifestyle at a self-set pace, and (c) enjoying positive physical effects of wheat bran consumption. This article examines the 3rd postintervention theme, "enjoying physical effects of wheat bran consumption." The relevance of this research is that nurses equipped with dietary fiber information may be better able to help some individuals with Crohn disease to explore the potential benefits of a well-rounded nutritious pattern of eating that includes wheat bran cereal.},

   abstract = {Crohn disease is a chronic disorder characterized by episodes of epithelial inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract for which there is no cure. The prevalence of Crohn disease increased in civilized nations during the time period in which food sources were industrialized in those nations. A characteristic of industrialized diets is the conspicuous absence of cereal fiber. The purpose of this 2-group, randomized, controlled study was to investigate the effects of fiber-related dietary instructions specifying wheat bran consumption on health-related quality of life and gastrointestinal function in individuals diagnosed with Crohn disease, as measured by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and the partial Harvey Bradshaw Index, respectively. Results demonstrated that consuming a wheat bran-inclusive diet was feasible and caused no adverse effects, and participants consuming whole wheat bran in the diet reported improved health-related quality of life (p = .028) and gastrointestinal function (p = .008) compared to the attention control group. The results of a secondary aim, to investigate differences in measures of systemic inflammation, found no group differences in C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rates. This study suggests that diet modification may be a welcomed complementary therapy for individuals suffering gastrointestinal disruption associated with Crohn disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), consisting of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic immune mediated diseases of unknown aetiology. Traditionally, the highest occurrence of both UC and CD is found in North America and Europe, including Scandinavia and the United Kingdom, while the diseases remain rare in Eastern Europe. Until recently, few population-based cohort data were available on the epidemiology of IBD in Eastern Europe. However, recent studies from Hungary and Croatia have reported steep increases in IBD incidence that means they are now comparable with Western European countries. The reasons for these changes remain unknown but could include an increasing awareness of the diseases, better access to diagnostic procedures, methodological bias in previous studies from Eastern Europe, or real differences in environmental factors, lifestyle and genetic susceptibility. The aim of this thesis was to create a prospective European population-based inception cohort of incident IBD patients in order to investigate whether an East-West gradient in the incidence of IBD exists in Europe. Furthermore, we investigated possible differences throughout Europe during the first year subsequent to diagnosis in terms of clinical presentation, disease outcome, treatment choices, frequency of environmental risk factors, as well as patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and quality of care (QoC). Finally, we assessed resource utilization during the initial year of disease in both geographic regions. A total number of 31 centres from 14 Western and 8 Eastern European countries covering a total background population of approximately 10.1 million participated in this study. During the inclusion period from 1 January to 31 December 2010 a total number of 1,515 patients aged 15 years or older were included in the cohort. Annual incidence rates were twice as high in Western Europe (CD: 6.3/100,000; UC: 9.8/100,000) compared to Eastern Europe (CD: 3.3/100,000; UC: 4.6/100,000), thus confirming a gradient in IBD incidence. The incidence gradient could not be explained by marked differences in environmental factors prior to IBD diagnosis. In fact, Eastern European patients had higher frequencies of dietary risk factors than Western European patients, while the remaining risk factors occurred just as frequently. Furthermore, the availability of diagnostic tools and the diagnostic strategy did not differ, and in fact was better in Eastern Europe in terms of the use of colonoscopies and diagnostic delay. In terms of socio-economic characteristics as well as clinical presentation at diagnosis Eastern and Western European IBD patients did not differ significantly. However, regarding treatment choices during the initial year of disease the use of biological therapy was significantly higher in Western Europe for both CD and UC, while Eastern European centres used 5-ASA more often in CD and UC. In both regions patients were treated earlier and more frequently with immunomodulators compared to previous cohorts. But despite these differences in treatment, disease course - including hospitalisation and surgery rates during the first year of disease - were similar in both regions and the majority of patients were in clinical remission at follow-up. Finally, generic and disease-specific HRQoL improved in all IBD patients and at twelve months follow-up the majority of patients had a good disease-specific HRQoL score. Differences in how, and from whom, patients received disease-specific education and information were noted between the geographic regions; for instance IBD specialist nurses were not used in Eastern European IBD centres. Expenses for the cohort during the initial year of disease exceeded four million Euros with most money spent on diagnostics and surgery. Biological therapy accounted for one fourth costs in Western European CD patients. Long-term follow-up of the EpiCom cohort is needed in order to assess whether the earlier and more frequent treatment with immunomodulators and biologicals observed in this study will change the natural disease course and phenotypes over time or merely postpone outcomes such as surgery. Furthermore, the question of if and how differences in treatment choices between Eastern and Western Europe impact on the disease course requires long-term follow-up.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing in Eastern Europe possibly due to changes in environmental factors towards a more "westernised" standard of living. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in exposure to environmental factors prior to diagnosis in Eastern and Western European IBD patients. METHODS: The EpiCom cohort is a population-based, prospective inception cohort of 1560 unselected IBD patients from 31 European countries covering a background population of 10.1 million. At the time of diagnosis patients were asked to complete an 87-item questionnaire concerning environmental factors. RESULTS: A total of 1182 patients (76%) answered the questionnaire, 444 (38%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 627 (53%) ulcerative colitis (UC), and 111 (9%) IBD unclassified. No geographic differences regarding smoking status, caffeine intake, use of oral contraceptives, or number of first-degree relatives with IBD were found. Sugar intake was higher in CD and UC patients from Eastern Europe than in Western Europe while fibre intake was lower (p<0.01). Daily consumption of fast food as well as appendectomy before the age of 20 was more frequent in Eastern European than in Western European UC patients (p<0.01). Eastern European CD and UC patients had received more vaccinations and experienced fewer childhood infections than Western European patients (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this European population-based inception cohort of unselected IBD patients, Eastern and Western European patients differed in environmental factors prior to diagnosis. Eastern European patients exhibited higher occurrences of suspected risk factors for IBD included in the Western lifestyle.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dietary factors have been indicated to influence the pathogenesis and nature course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with their wide variances. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and clinical significance of 14 serum food specific immunoglobulin G (sIgG) antibodies in patients with IBD. METHODS: This retrospective study comprised a total of 112 patients with IBD, including 79 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 33 with ulcerative colitis (UC). Medical records, clinical data and laboratory results were collected for analysis. Serum IgG antibodies against 14 unique food allergens were detected by semi-quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Food sIgG antibodies were detected in 75.9% (60/79) of CD patients, 63.6% (21/33) of UC patients and 33.1% (88/266) of healthy controls (HC). IBD patients showed the significantly higher antibodies prevalence than healthy controls (CD vs. HC, P = 0.000; UC vs. HC, P = 0.001). However no marked difference was observed between CD and UC groups (P = 0.184). More subjects were found with sensitivity to multiple antigens (>/= 3) in IBD than in HC group (33.9% vs.0.8%, P = 0.000). Egg was the most prevalent food allergen. There was a remarkable difference in the levels of general serum IgM (P = 0.045) and IgG (P = 0.041) between patients with positive and negative sIgG antibodies. Patients with multiple positive allergens (>/= 3) were especially found with significant higher total IgG levels compared with sIgG-negative patients (P = 0.003). Age was suggested as a protective factor against the occurrence of sIgG antibodies (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates a high prevalence of serum IgG antibodies to specific food allergens in patients with IBD. sIgG antibodies may potentially indicate disease status in clinical and be utilized to guide diets for patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a chronic granulomatous condition of the mouth, face and lips. Recent work demonstrates a high rate of atopy and silver birch sensitisation from skin prick testing (SPT). Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is an acute oro-pharyngeal IgE mediated reaction, triggered by foods that cross react with pollens, most commonly silver birch. The aim of this study was to determine if patients with OFG and positive SPT to common OAS associated pollens responded to avoidance of cross reactive foods. METHODS: Patients with OFG and positive SPT to silver birch, grass, mugwort, ragweed and latex were required to avoid cross reacting foods, for 6 weeks and, in those who responded, for a total of 12 weeks. All had standardized oral examinations and were given severity scores (SS) at each appointment. RESULTS: Twenty two of 47 (47%) patients had one or more positive SPT and 13/22 completed 6 weeks on the diet. No difference was seen in SS between weeks 0 (14.62 +/- 11.16) and 6 (13.31 +/- 10.33; P = 0.656). Six of 14 (43%) had significantly improved SS (week 0; 19.17 +/- 12.95, week 6; 10.83 +/- 4.99, P = 0.027). Five completed 12 weeks and no further improvement was seen (week 6; 11 +/- 5.57, week 12; 10.4 +/- 9.94; P = 0.068). Two patients required no further treatments. CONCLUSIONS: On an intention to treat basis, only 2/14 patients improved and required no further intervention. Whilst this diet cannot be recommended routinely, the improvement seen in some patients raises questions about the role of OAS in patients with OFG.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a rare disease of unknown cause. A cinnamon- and benzoate-free diet is successful in up to 72% of patients. Phenolic acids are among the chemical constituents restricted in this diet, which avoids some but not all of these structurally similar compounds. The present study aimed to: (i) develop a novel diet low in phenolic acids; (ii) implement this in a small clinical trial; and (iii) assess its nutritional adequacy. METHODS: A literature review identified 10 papers quantifying phenolic acids from which 91 10-mg phenolic acid exchanges were devised. A phenolic acid exclusion diet with precautionary micronutrient supplementation was designed and implemented in 10 patients. Phenolic acids were excluded for 6 weeks and were reintroduced at a rate of one exchange every second day for 6 weeks. Wilcoxon matched pairs tests analysed disease outcomes measured by an oral disease severity scoring tool at weeks 0, 6 and 12. Nutritional adequacy was assessed, excluding micronutrient supplementation, at weeks 0 and 6, and compared intakes with dietary reference values. RESULTS: The diet was nutritionally inadequate for a range of micronutrients. Seven of 10 patients responded. Mean [standard deviation (SD)] severity scores improved from week 0-6 [20.8 (9.39) and 10.1 (5.72); P = 0.009] and were maintained in five patients who completed the reintroduction [6.6 (3.13) and 7.2 (5.54); P = 0.713]. CONCLUSIONS: A low phenolic acid diet with micronutrient supplementation holds promise of a novel dietary treatment for OFG. Further work is required in larger studies to determine long-term outcomes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are plausible mechanisms for how dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, could prevent Crohn's disease (CD). AIM: To conduct a prospective study to investigate the association between increased intake of DHA and risk of CD. METHODS: Overall, 229 702 participants were recruited from nine European centres between 1991 and 1998. At recruitment, dietary intakes of DHA and fatty acids were measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored through to June 2004 to identify participants who developed incident CD. In a nested case-control analysis, each case was matched with four controls; odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for quintiles of DHA intake, adjusted for total energy intake, smoking, other dietary fatty acids, dietary vitamin D and body mass index. RESULTS: Seventy-three participants developed incident CD. All higher quintiles of DHA intake were inversely associated with development of CD; the highest quintile had the greatest effect size (OR = 0.07; 95% CI = 0.02-0.81). The OR trend across quintiles of DHA was 0.54 (95% CI = 0.30-0.99, Ptrend = 0.04). Including BMI in the multivariate analysis, due to its correlation with dietary fat showed similar associations. There were no associations with the other dietary fatty acids studied. CONCLUSION: There were inverse associations, with a biological gradient between increasing dietary docosahexaenoic acid intakes and incident Crohn's disease. Further studies in other populations should measure docosahexaenoic acid to determine if the association is consistent and the hypothesis tested in randomised controlled trials of purely docosahexaenoic acid supplementation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Obesity is associated with a proinflammatory state that may be involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), for which there are plausible biological mechanisms. Our aim was to perform the first prospective cohort study investigating if there is an association between obesity and the development of incident IBD. METHODS: A total of 300,724 participants were recruited into the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. At recruitment, anthropometric measurements of height and weight plus physical activity and total energy intake from validated questionnaires were recorded. The cohort was monitored identifying participants who developed either Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). Each case was matched with four controls and conditional logistic regression used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for body mass index (BMI) adjusted for smoking, energy intake, and physical activity. RESULTS: In the cohort, 177 participants developed incident UC and 75 participants developed incident CD. There were no associations with the four higher categories of BMI compared with a normal BMI for UC (Ptrend=0.36) or CD (Ptrend=0.83). The lack of associations was consistent when BMI was analyzed as a continuous or binary variable (BMI 18.5<25.0 vs. >/=25 kg/m(2)). Physical activity and total energy intake, factors that influence BMI, did not show any association with UC (physical activity, Ptrend=0.79; total energy intake, Ptrend=0.18) or CD (physical activity, Ptrend=0.42; total energy, Ptrend=0.11). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity as measured by BMI is not associated with the development of incident UC or CD. Alternative measures of obesity are required to further investigate the role of obesity in the development of incident IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet may have a role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. In previous studies, the associations between increased intakes of carbohydrates, sugar, starch, and inflammatory bowel disease are inconsistent. However, few prospective studies have investigated the associations between these macronutrients and incident Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: A total of 401,326 men and women were recruited between 1991 and 1998. At recruitment, dietary intakes of carbohydrate, sugar, and starch were measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored identifying participants who developed incident CD or UC. Cases were matched with 4 controls, and odds ratios were calculated for quintiles of total carbohydrate, sugar, and starch intakes adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, and smoking. RESULTS: One hundred ten participants developed CD, and 244 participants developed UC during follow-up. The adjusted odds ratio for the highest versus the lowest quintiles of total carbohydrate intake for CD was 0.87, 95% CI = 0.24 to 3.12 and for UC 1.46, 95% CI = 0.62 to 3.46, with no significant trends across quintiles for either (CD, P trend = 0.70; UC, P trend = 0.41). Similarly, no associations were observed with intakes of total sugar (CD, P trend = 0.50; UC, P trend = 0.71) or starch (CD, P trend = 0.69; UC, P trend = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of associations with these nutrients is in agreement with many case-control studies that have not identified associations with CD or UC. As there is biological plausibility for how specific carbohydrates could have an etiological role in inflammatory bowel disease, future epidemiological work should assess individual carbohydrates, although there does not seem to be a macronutrient effect.},

It is rare for both celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease to occur together in an individual patient. This association has been reported in adults, however, very rarely in children. Here, we report an unusual case of an 8-year-old child with a history of anemia and failure to thrive who presented with bloody diarrhea. His evaluation showed anemia, elevated inflammatory markers, and positive celiac antibodies. Endoscopic evaluation revealed partial duodenal villous atrophy and pancolitis. He was diagnosed with celiac disease and UC and responded well to a gluten-free diet and steroid/mesalamine therapy. The patient's genetic testing revealed markers showing susceptibility for both celiac disease and UC. It is important to be aware of this association as both conditions can present with similar clinical features, however, require different therapeutic approaches.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cheilitis granulomatosa causes persistent idiopathic lip swelling and ulceration and it can sometimes be recognized as a unique or early manifestation of Crohn's disease. Spontaneous remission is rare and with the lack of controlled trials, different therapeutic approaches have been used. Some cases have been treated with an exclusion diet in the attempt to rule out diet allergens, while the most popular treatments include antibiotics such as tetracycline and clofazimine tranilast, benzocaine topical or intralesional steroids, and cheiloplasty, with different outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 23-year-old Caucasian man, primarily diagnosed with cheilitis granulomatosa for a severe lower lip swelling, and then with Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum and anus. Treatment of Crohn's disease with an anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agent (infliximab) successfully induced remission of both the gastrointestinal disease and the oral lesion. CONCLUSIONS: Our recommendation is that physicians should be able to recognize cheilitis granulomatosa as a possible marker of a more complex systemic disease and proceed first with an accurate physical examination, and further suggest investigations of the bowel. In cases of Crohn's disease, a therapy with biological agents can be successful.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate clinical and mucosal responses to the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) in children with Crohn disease (CD). METHODS: Eligible patients with active CD (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] >/= 15) underwent a patency capsule and, if passed intact, capsule endoscopy (CE) was performed. Patients taking SCD were monitored for 52 weeks while maintaining all prescribed medications. Demographic, dietary, and clinical information, PCDAI, Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), and Lewis score (LS) were collected at 0, 12, and 52 weeks. CEs were evaluated by an experienced reader blinded to patient clinical information and timing. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were screened; 10 enrolled; and 9 completed the initial 12-week trial-receiving 85% of estimated caloric needs before, and 101% on the SCD. HB significantly decreased from 3.3 +/- 2.0 to 0.6 +/- 1.3 (P = 0.007) as did PCDAI (21.1 +/- 5.9 to 7.8 +/- 7.1, P = 0.011). LS declined significantly from 2153 +/- 732 to 960 +/- 433 (P = 0.012). Seven patients continued the SCD up to 52 weeks; HB (0.1 +/- 0.4) and PCDAI (5.4 +/- 5.5) remained improved (P = 0.016 and 0.027 compared to baseline), with mean LS at 1046 +/- 372 and 2 patients showed sustained mucosal healing. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and mucosal improvements were seen in children with CD, who used SCD for 12 and 52 weeks. In addition, CE can monitor mucosal improvement in treatment trials for pediatric CD. Further studies are critically needed to understand the mechanisms underlying SCD's effectiveness in children with CD.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The coeliac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by an ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Like some other systemic diseases (Crohn's disease, Sjogren's syndrome) the celiac disease is able to alter the oral ecosystem and the composition of the saliva. AIM: The aim of this retrospective study has been to examine the incidence of coeliac disease (CD) in paediatric population and to search the presence of anti-transglutaminase auto-antibodies (anti-tTG) in saliva, comparing and quantifying the concentration regard to the serum values of the anti-tTG auto-antibodies, before and after six months from the beginning of the free gluten diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 105 children (G0), aged between 5 and 13 years, belonging to the Paediatric Gastroenterology-Endoscopy Unit of PTV Hospital, University of Rome "Tor Vergata", have been examined for a diagnosis of suspected CD. RESULTS: Of a total of 105 pediatric patients (G0), only the 16.2% (G1) has showed to be positive. About the evaluation of the anti-tTG auto-antibodies in the serum, obtained from the second blood sample (T1), we can observe that 10 (G2) out of 17 children (G1) show positivity and for this reason they have been subjected to a sampling of intestinal villi to confirm the diagnosis of CD; in addition the 6.7% has been resulted positive at the first sampling of serum (T0), but negative to the second one (T1). The incidence of the CD has been resulted to be equal to 9.5%. About the evaluation of anti-tTG in the G1, we can observe that 58.8% of children are "definitely positive" to the salivary anti-tTG, while 11.8% appear to be weakly positive. About the correspondence of serum and salivary anti-tTG in Group G1, we can observe, that children positive to the anti-tTG in the serum have also the anti-tTG in the salivary fluid (sensibility 100%, specificity 71.4%). The results show that the anti-tTG salivary are present in children with CD, even though they have continued to follow the gluten free diet for 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of anti-tTG in the saliva may be considered, an additional and useful diagnostic dental marker for an initial, reproducible, non invasive, inexpensive and highly sensitive screening of CD having a predictive and precocious value compared to anti-tTG contained in the serum, as it has been already demonstrated.},

We investigated whether variants of genes that control polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism (CYP4F3, FADS1, and FADS2), along with the dietary ratio of omega6/omega3, confers susceptibility to CD. Based on data from 182 children newly diagnosed with CD and 250 controls, we found that children who consumed a higher dietary ratio of omega6/omega3 were susceptible for CD if they were also carriers of specific variants of CYP4F3 and FADS2 genes. Our findings implicate diet-gene interactions in the pathogenesis of CD.},

   abstract = {Cheilitis granulomatosa (CG) is a cosmetically disturbing and persistent idiopathic lip swelling. It is one manifestation of orofacial granulomatosis (OFG), which is a clinical entity describing facial and oral swelling in the setting of non-caseating granulomatous inflammation and in the absence of systemic disease such as Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis. CG can occur by itself or as part of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, which includes facial palsy and a plicated tongue. Other proposed causes of OFG include dietary allergens such as cinnamon and benzoates. Similar orofacial swelling may be an early manifestation of Crohn's disease or sarcoidosis, and so clinical history is important in diagnosis. The cause of CG has not been wholly elucidated, but a current hypothesis holds that a random influx of inflammatory cells is responsible. Other granulomatous and edematous causes of lip swelling must be investigated prior to diagnosis. Options for treatment include dietary modifications, antibiotics, systemic or intralesional corticosteroids, and surgery, although treatment is not always necessary. CG should be considered in the differential of persistent lip swelling.},

He was started on vitamin A supplementation (initially intramuscular). His vitamin A level was back to normal (78 microg/dL), and night vision problems subjectively improved. Patients with Crohn's disease should be inquired about night vision problems. The presence of nyctalopia should prompt vitamin A level measurement and ophthalmology referral for further evaluation.},

TS affects residents of, and visitors to, endemic tropical regions. Rarely the disease may remain latent for several years, and to date, few cases of latent TS have been reported in Europe or North America. However, in our increasingly multicultural communities and in a 'global village' where travel is common, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for TS in patients presenting with diarrhea and malabsorption who have traveled to endemic regions. TS may mimic common diarrheal diseases that are seen in developed nations, including celiac disease, Crohn's disease, bacterial overgrowth, and other infectious etiologies. Accordingly, once these more common etiologies have been ruled out, TS must be considered in patients presenting with diarrhea after travel to endemic regions. We present a unique Canadian case of latent TS, with a brief review of the diagnostic approach and treatment.},

   abstract = {Dietary supplementation has traditionally consisted of adding vitamins and/or minerals to correct or prevent a nutritional deficiency. When supplementing the diet with other inflammatory mediators, such as essential fatty acids, there is an adjunctive benefit to the standard therapies used in the control of chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease or rheumatoid arthritis. This review focuses on the strategies utilized for therapeutic modulation of the inflammatory cascade through dietary supplementation with specific biomolecules. Examples of how these biomolecules affect local and systemic immune responses to chronic inflammation are examined. In particular, an overview of the literature identifying the potential to modify the host response to chronic periodontitis is provided.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vitamin D deficiency has been observed in a wide range of medical conditions including Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to assess whether CD patients have lower vitamin D levels than healthy controls, and to determine risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. METHODS: 25(OH)D was measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay in serum obtained from 101 CD patients and 41 controls. Demographics, sunlight exposure, dietary vitamin D intake, comorbidities and medication were recorded using validated questionnaires. In CD patients the Harvey-Bradshaw index, Montreal classification and surgical resections were also evaluated. 25(OH)D levels of > 75 nmol/L, between 50 and 75 nmol/L and < 50 nmol/L were considered as normal, suboptimal and deficient, respectively. RESULTS: Vitamin D levels were rather low but comparable among CD patients and controls (mean 25(OH)D 51.6 nmol/L(+/- 26.6) in CD, and 60.8 nmol/L(+/- 27.6) in controls. Multivariate regression analysis revealed BMI, sun protection behaviour, non-Caucasian ethnicity, no use of tanning beds, and no holidays in the last year as significantly associated with serum 25(OH)D levels in CD patients (R=0.62). In the control group no statistically significant factors were identified that had an impact on 25(OH)D serum levels. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is common in CD patients, but also in healthy controls. Appropriate vitamin D screening should be advised in patients with CD. Moreover, the positive effect of sunlight on the vitamin D status should be discussed with CD patients, but this should be balanced against the potential risk of developing melanomas, especially in patients using thiopurines.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by impaired mineralization of the bone matrix. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption syndromes may cause osteomalacia. This is a case of a patient with a 6-year history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's disease who was admitted to our outpatient clinic with symptoms of osteomalacia. INTRODUCTION: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disease characterized by an impaired mineralization of the bone matrix, frequently caused by disorders in vitamin D or phosphate metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption syndromes (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and jejuno-ileal bypass for obesity) may cause osteomalacia. CASE REPORT: A 43-year-old male presented with fatigue, low back pain, and morning stiffness. He had a 6-year history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's disease. Laboratory findings revealed low serum calcium, low 25-hydroxy vitamin D3, normal phosphorus, elevated parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase levels. Radiographs revealed grade IV sacroiliitis and Looser zones. He was diagnosed with osteomalacia due to the malabsorption of vitamin D. His symptoms and signs were relieved with supplements of vitamin D and calcium. CONCLUSIONS: Osteomalacia should be considered in differential diagnosis when assessing low back pain in the patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamin D deficiency should be treated with vitamin D supplementation in patients with Crohn's disease to prevent osteomalacia.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) are abnormally predominant on Crohn's disease (CD) ileal mucosa. AIEC strains adhere to enterocytes via interaction between type 1 pili and CEACAM6 receptors abnormally expressed on CD ileal mucosa, leading to gut inflammation. We analysed whether epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the upregulation of CEACAM6 expression in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). DESIGN: Methylation of CEACAM6 promoter was analysed using bisulfite sequencing and site-specific methylation by SnapShot. pCpGfree reporter system was used to analyse CEACAM6 promoter activity. Transgenic mice expressing human CEACAM6 fed either standard food or a low-methyl diet (LMD) were orally challenged with 10(9) AIEC LF82. After 3 days, gut-associated AIEC and proinflammatory cytokines were quantified. RESULTS: Analysis of CEACAM6 gene promoter revealed potentially methylated dinucleotide CpGs within HIF-1-responsive elements (HREs). Methylation levels of CpG within CEACAM6 promoter were inversely correlated with CEACAM6 expression in IEC expressing various levels of CEACAM6. We show the critical role of HRE methylation and transcription factor HIF-1 in the regulation of CEACAM6 gene in IEC. This was confirmed in transgenic mice expressing human CEACAM6 fed a LMD. LMD-dependent HRE demethylation led to abnormal gut expression of CEACAM6, favouring AIEC colonisation and subsequent inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: HRE hypomethylation in CEACAM6 promoter correlates with high expression in IEC. Our findings suggest that abnormal DNA methylation leading to CEACAM6 increased expression and AIEC-mediated gut inflammation can be related to changes in nutritional habits, such as low intake in methyl donor molecules, leading to abnormal epigenetic marks in mouse model mimicking CD susceptibility.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the impacts of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from the patients' perspective and to inform the development of a conceptual model. METHODS: Focus groups and one-on-one interviews were undertaken in adult patients with IBD. Transcripts from the focus groups and interviews were analyzed to identify themes and links between themes, assisted by qualitative data software MaxQDA. Themes from the qualitative research were supplemented with those reported in the literature and concepts included in IBD-specific patient-reported outcome measures. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients participated. Key physical symptoms included pain, bowel-related symptoms such as frequency, urgency, incontinence, diarrhea, passing blood, and systemic symptoms such as weight loss and fatigue. Participants described continuing and variable symptom experiences. IBD symptoms caused immediate disruption of activities but also had ongoing impacts on daily activities, including dietary restrictions, lifestyle changes, and maintaining close proximity to a toilet. More distal impacts included interference with work, school, parenting, social and leisure activities, relationships, and psychological well-being. The inconvenience of rectal medications, refrigerated biologics, and medication refills emerged as novel burdens not identified in existing patient-reported outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: IBD symptoms cause immediate disruption in activities, but patients may continue to experience some symptoms on a chronic basis. The conceptual model presented here may be useful for identifying target concepts for measurement in future studies in IBD.},

   abstract = {Due to the intestinal inflammation, tissue damage, and painful abdominal symptoms restricting dietary intake associated with both diseases, patients with intestinal pelvic radiation disease (PRD) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk to develop protein calorie malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. In the current paper, we review the nutritional management of both diseases, listing the similar approaches of nutritional management and the nutritional implications of intestinal dysfunction of both diseases. Malnutrition is prevalent in patients with either disease and nutritional risk screening and assessment of nutritional status are required for designing the proper nutritional intervention plan. This plan may include dietary management, oral nutritional supplementation, and enteral and/or parenteral nutrition. In addition to managing malnutrition, nutrients exert immune modulating effects during periods of intestinal inflammation and can play a role in mitigating the risks associated with the disease activity. Consistently, exclusive enteral feeding is recommended for inducing remission in pediatric patients with active Crohn's disease, with less clear guidelines on use in patients with ulcerative colitis. The field of immune modulating nutrition is an evolving science that takes into consideration the specific mechanism of action of nutrients, nutrient-nutrient interaction, and preexisting nutritional status of the patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clinical management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), new treatment modalities and the potential impact of personalised medicine remain topics of intense interest as our understanding of the pathophysiology of IBD expands. METHODS: Potential future strategies for IBD management are discussed, based on recent preclinical and clinical research. RESULTS: A top-down approach to medical therapy is increasingly being adopted for patients with risk factors for severe inflammation or an unfavourable disease course in an attempt to halt the inflammatory process as early as possible, prevent complications and induce mucosal healing. In the future, biological therapies for IBD are likely to be used more selectively based on personalised benefit/risk assessment, determined through reliable biomarkers and tissue signatures, and will probably be optimised throughout the course of treatment. Biologics with different mechanisms of action will be available; when one drug fails, patients will be able to switch to another and even combination biologics may become a reality. The role of biotherapeutic products that are similar to currently licensed biologics in terms of quality, safety and efficacy - i.e. biosimilars - is at an early stage and requires further experience. Other therapeutic strategies may involve manipulation of the microbiome using antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, diet and combinations of all these approaches. Faecal microbiota transplantation is also a potential option in IBD although controlled data are lacking. CONCLUSIONS: The future of classifying, prognosticating and managing IBD involves an outcomes-based approach to identify biomarkers reflecting various biological processes that can be matched with clinically important endpoints.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor bowel control is a major concern of people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous research demonstrates the impact of fecal incontinence (FI) on adults in the non-IBD population; there are no previous reports on the experience of IBD-related FI. METHODS: We randomly sampled 10,000 members of Crohn's & Colitis UK to receive a questionnaire to collect demographic information, medical history, continence status, quality of life, and free-text responses to questions about FI. Respondents could also choose to be interviewed about their experiences of living with IBD-related FI. This article presents findings from the free-text paper questionnaire responses and the interviews. Following transcription, data were sorted and analyzed using a pragmatic thematic approach. RESULTS: We received 3264 eligible replies (32.6%). Twenty-eight interviews and 583 sets of questionnaire data were transcribed, continuing with the latter until no new themes emerged. The remaining questionnaires (n = 2681) were read to check that no issues had been missed. Several core themes emerged: emotional and psychological impact, feelings of stigma, limited lives, symptoms, practical coping mechanisms, access to facilities, and fear of incontinence. DISCUSSION: Incontinence, and fear of it, limits social, working, and personal lives, impacting on people with IBD in complex ways. Key strategies, including situation avoidance and dietary restrictions, are used to cope. Incontinence is degrading and humiliating for most people, although a small number approach their situation positively. CONCLUSIONS: IBD-related FI, and fear of incontinence, causes multiple difficulties. People with IBD-related FI need help in accessing professional support.},

Nutritional deficiencies result from reduced oral intake, malabsorption, medication side effects and systemic inflammation due to active disease. Enteral nutrition has a role in support for the malnourished patient, as well as in primary therapy to induce and maintain remission. The use of parenteral nutrition in CD is mainly limited to the preoperative setting or for patients with intestinal failure, but does not offer any additional advantage over EN in disease control. Dietary modifications, including elimination-reintroduction diets and a low fermentable, oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet may improve symptoms but there are currently no data to suggest that these approaches have any role in the induction or maintenance of remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A limited body of research suggests that ongoing maintenance enteral nutrition (MEN) can be beneficial in maintaining disease remission in Crohn's Disease (CD). We aimed to assess how achievable MEN is and whether it helps to prolong remission. METHODS: Patients newly diagnosed with CD in 2010 and 2011 who commenced exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) for 8 weeks were followed up for a year post diagnosis. All patients who took EEN were encouraged to continue MEN post EEN. Data on azathioprine use was also collected. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square/Fischer's exact test. Medians were expressed along with complete data ranges. RESULTS: 59 patients (34 male, median age 11.07 years, range 2.5-16.33 years) were identified. 11/59 (18%) had a poor response to EEN and were switched to steroids. 48/59 patients completed 8 weeks EEN and achieved clinical remission/response. 46/48 patients received Modulen IBD(R), 29/48 (60%) consumed EEN orally and 19/48 (40%) via NGT. 15/48 (31%) patients were able to continue MEN post EEN completion. MEN was consumed for a mean of 10.8 months (range 4-14 months). 14/15 patients drank MEN and 1/15 had MEN via NGT. Remission rates at 1 year in patients continuing MEN were 60% (9/15) compared to 15% (2/13) in patients taking no treatment (p = 0.001) and 65% (13/20) in patients taking azathioprine (p = 0.14). CONCLUSION: A sub group of patients can continue MEN as a maintenance treatment and this seems a useful strategy, especially in those who are not commencing azathioprine.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In paediatric Crohn's disease (PCD), 6-8 weeks of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is effective in 60-80% cases. EEN is followed by gradual food reintroduction over variable (1-5 weeks) periods. Currently, there is no recommended duration or method for food reintroduction. The rationale for slow reintroduction is unclear and may be because of concerns about food intolerance or to maintain longer remission. AIMS: The aims of this study were as follows: to compare relapse rates following standard and rapid reintroduction of food after EEN in PCD and to determine the duration of maintained remission in two groups of PCD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups with PCD were compared: group A received standard food reintroduction over 5 weeks and group B received rapid reintroduction over 3 days. Data were collected over two consecutive time periods: group A (2005-2009) and group B (2009-2011). Only patients with a new diagnosis of PCD were included. Those with strictures and those on steroids or biologicals during EEN were excluded. The minimum duration of follow-up was 1 year. RESULTS: Group A included 20 patients and group B included 19 patients. In these groups, EEN led to clinical remission in 80% of the patients in group A and in 76% of the patients in group B. At 6 months, one-third of the patients from each group had developed relapse and a year after EEN, 50% of the patients in group A and 47% of the patients in group B developed relapse. Time to first relapse was 188 days (group A) and 136 days (group B). None of these results were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In PCD, rapid food reintroduction following 6-week EEN is safe and equally effective as longer food reintroduction. We propose that a rapid food reintroduction schedule be recommended as the most tolerable approach for food reintroduction. Relapse rate and duration of remission are uninfluenced by the type of food reintroduction.},

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A series of systematic literature reviews were undertaken to identify studies reporting seasonal and monthly data on clinical onset or relapse of gastrointestinal diseases (Acute pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Peptic ulcer diseases (PUD), gastroesophageal reflux disease, colon cancer and colonic diverticulitis). Thirty-two primary studies (published 1970-2012) from 17 countries were identified. RESULTS: Upon review of the evidence, it appears that the seasonal peaks of PUD are most prominent in colder months while the peak of incidence rate of Crohn diseases in most of the countries subjects were found during the spring and summer seasons. Seasonal trend in the onset of acute pancreatitis exhibits a summer peak in some countries. There were no clearly seasonal peaks noted for the ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Future experimental and observational studies should consider how the environmental factors (infection, cold, air pollution etc.) or other triggers (dietary habit, alcohol consumption) promotes or hinders such diseases.},

Both types of inflammatory bowel disease have a complex etiology, resulting from a genetically determined susceptibility interacting with environmental factors, including the diet and gut microbiota. Genome Wide Association Studies have implicated more than 160 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in disease susceptibility. Consideration of the different pathways suggested to be involved implies that specific dietary interventions are likely to be appropriate, dependent upon the nature of the genes involved. Epigenetics and the gut microbiota are also responsive to dietary interventions. Nutrigenetics may lead to personalized nutrition for disease prevention and treatment, while nutrigenomics may help to understand the nature of the disease and individual response to nutrients.},

In genetically susceptible individuals, the interaction between environmental factors and normal intestinal commensal flora is believed to lead to an inappropriate immune response that results in chronic inflammation. The incidence of IBD have increased in the past century in developed and developing countries. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the current knowledge of the association between environmental risk factors and IBD. A number of environmental risk factors were investigated including smoking, hygiene, microorganisms, oral contraceptives, antibiotics, diet, breastfeeding, geographical factors, pollution and stress. Inconsistent findings among the studies highlight the complex pathogenesis of IBD. Additional studies are necessary to identify and elucidate the role of environmental factors in IBD etiology.},

Malnutrition should be assessed in case of IBD (in 20 - 70 % of Crohn's patients) and weight loss(> 5 % within 3 months) or nutritional deficiencies or after extensive bowel resection and afterwards also treated. Malnutrition should be treated with medical therapy of IBD and also adequate - as far as possible - with oral nutritional therapy particularly because of reduced life quality, risk of opportunistic infections, osteopenia/osteoporosis, longer hospitalisations and higher mortality. Iron homeostasis, serum levels of Vitamin B12- and folic acid, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and zinc should be checked. Therapy with enteral liquid diets is only indicated as therapy of first choice in children and adolescents, but only in rare situations in adults with IBD. There is - up to now - no proven oral diet for maintenance of remission in IBD. Probiotics as E. coli Nissle could be used as alternative to mesalazine for maintenance of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. A specific dietary counselling is mandatory in patients with ileostoma or short bowel syndrome. Malnutrition of short bowel patients is particularly dependent on the function and length of the remaining bowel, therefore the most effective medical therapy should be administered.},

However, the effects of probiotics on the induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) still remain controversial. This systematic review verified the findings of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated the therapeutic effects of probiotics on IBD. After the quality assessment, 20 RCTs which investigated the effects of probiotics on the induction or maintenance of remission in IBD were identified. From the results of the validation of these RCTs, beneficial effects of probiotic treatments to improve the response rate and remission rate on the remission induction therapies [risk ratio (RR) 1.81; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.40-2.35 and RR 1.56; 95 % CI 0.95-2.56, respectively] were verified. Furthermore, probiotic treatments exhibited effects equal to mesalazine on the maintenance of remission in UC (RR 1.00; 95 % CI 0.79-1.26). In contrast, no significant effect of probiotic treatments was shown in either the induction or maintenance of remission in CD. Because there were many variations in the conditions among these studies, a further analysis evaluating the effects of probiotic treatments in IBD is needed to clarify the optimal probiotics and treatment regimens for each condition or population in IBD patients.},

   abstract = {AIM: Celiac disease (CD) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease induced by ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Despite technological progress, the diagnosis of CD is still based on duodenal biopsy as it was 50 years ago. In this study we analysed the expression of CD-associated genes in small bowel biopsies of patients and controls in order to explore the multivariate pathway of the expression profile of CD patients. Then, using multivariant discriminant analysis, we evaluated whether the expression profiles of these genes in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) differed between patients and controls. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven patients with active and 11 with treated CD, 40 healthy controls and 9 disease controls (Crohn's disease patients) were enrolled. RESULTS: Several genes were differentially expressed in CD patients versus controls, but the analysis of each single gene did not provided a comprehensive picture. A multivariate discriminant analysis showed that the expression of 5 genes in intestinal mucosa accounted for 93% of the difference between CD patients and controls. We then applied the same approach to PBMs, on a training set of 20 samples. The discriminant equation obtained was validated on a testing cohort of 10 additional cases and controls, and we obtained a correct classification of all CD cases and of 91% of the control samples. We applied this equation to treated CD patients and to disease controls and obtained a discrimination of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The combined expression of 4 genes allows one to discriminate between CD patients and controls, and between CD patients on a gluten-free diet and disease controls. Our results contribute to the understanding of the complex interactions among CD-associated genes, and they may represent a starting point for the development of a molecular diagnosis of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota is implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a successful treatment, but its mode of action remains unknown. This study assessed serial changes in the fecal microbiota milieu during EEN. METHODS: Five fecal samples were collected from CD children: 4 during EEN (start, 15, 30, end EEN approximately 60 days) and the fifth on habitual diet. Two samples were collected from healthy control subjects. Fecal pH, bacterial metabolites, global microbial diversity abundance, composition stability, and quantitative changes of total and 7 major bacterial groups previously implicated in CD were measured. RESULTS: Overall, 68 samples were from 15 CD children and 40 from 21 control subjects. Fecal pH and total sulfide increased and butyric acid decreased during EEN (all P < 0.05). Global bacterial diversity abundance decreased (P < 0.05); a higher degree of microbiota composition stability was seen in control subjects than in CD children during EEN (at P </= 0.008). Faecalibacterium prausnitzii spp concentration significantly decreased after 30 days on EEN (P < 0.05). In patients who responded to EEN, the magnitude of the observed changes was greater and the concentration of Bacteroides/Prevotella group decreased (P < 0.05). All these changes reverted to pretreatment levels on free diet, and EEN microbiota diversity increased when the children returned to their free diet. CONCLUSIONS: EEN impacts on gut microbiota composition and changes fecal metabolic activity. It is difficult to infer a causative association between such changes and disease improvement, but the results do challenge the current perception of a protective role for F. prausnitzii in CD.},

   abstract = {The epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract is one of the most versatile tissues in the organism, responsible for providing a tight barrier between dietary and bacterial antigens and the mucosal and systemic immune system while maintaining efficient digestive and absorptive processes to ensure adequate nutrient and energy supply. Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are associated with a breakdown of both functions, which in some cases are clearly interrelated. In this updated literature review, we focus on the effects of intestinal inflammation and the associated immune mediators on selected aspects of the transepithelial transport of macronutrients and micronutrients. The mechanisms responsible for nutritional deficiencies are not always clear and could be related to decreased intake, malabsorption, and excess losses. We summarize the known causes of nutrient deficiencies and the mechanism of inflammatory bowel disease-associated diarrhea. We also overview the consequences of impaired epithelial transport, which infrequently transcend its primary purpose to affect the gut microbial ecology and epithelial integrity. Although some of those regulatory mechanisms are relatively well established, more work needs to be done to determine how inflammatory cytokines can alter the transport process of nutrients across the gastrointestinal and renal epithelia.},

   abstract = {Vitamin D deficiency, diagnosed when the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD(3)) concentration is less than 20 ng/mL, has joined vitamin A deficiency as two of the most common nutrition-responsive medical conditions worldwide. There have been more scientific articles published about vitamin D in the 21st century than about any other vitamin, reflecting the massive expansion of the field of vitamin D research. Adequate vitamin D status has been linked to decreased risks of developing specific cancers, including cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, gallbladder, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus, ovary, prostate, urinary bladder, kidney, skin, thyroid, and hematopoietic system (e.g., Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma); bacterial infections; rheumatoid arthritis; Crohn's disease; periodontal disease; multiple sclerosis; asthma; type 2 diabetes; cardiovascular disease; stroke; peripheral artery disease; hypertension; chronic kidney disease; muscle weakness; cognitive impairment; Alzheimer's disease; clinical depression; and premature death. On the other hand, inadequate vitamin D status during human pregnancy may be associated with increased risk for the development of type 1 diabetes in the offspring. However, this point of view may be excessively optimistic. There also is evidence that despite the current heavy reliance on serum 25-OHD(3) concentration for the diagnosis of an individual's vitamin D status, local tissue vitamin D intoxication may be present in individuals with much lower serum 25-OHD(3) concentrations than are currently appreciated. Only rarely are the symptoms of local tissue vitamin D intoxication associated with vitamin D status or intake. An individual's serum 25-OHD(3) concentration may appear to be "low" for reasons totally independent of sunlight exposure or vitamin D intake. Serum 25-OHD(3) concentration is only poorly responsive to increases in vitamin D intake, and the prolonged routine consumption of thousands of international units of vitamin D may interfere with the regulation of phosphate homeostasis by fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) and the Klotho gene product, with consequences that are detrimental to human health. In light of these counterbalancing observations, curbing excessive enthusiasm for universally increasing vitamin D intake recommendations may be in order.},

   abstract = {Mucosal surfaces of the lower gastrointestinal tract are subject to frequent, pronounced fluctuations in oxygen tension, particularly during inflammation. Adaptive responses to hypoxia are orchestrated largely by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). As HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha are coexpressed in mucosal epithelia that constitute the barrier between the lumen and the underlying immune milieu, we sought to define the discrete contribution of HIF-1 and HIF-2 transactivation pathways to intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis. The present study identifies creatine kinases (CKs), key metabolic enzymes for rapid ATP generation via the phosphocreatine-creatine kinase (PCr/CK) system, as a unique gene family that is coordinately regulated by HIF. Cytosolic CKs are expressed in a HIF-2-dependent manner in vitro and localize to apical intestinal epithelial cell adherens junctions, where they are critical for junction assembly and epithelial integrity. Supplementation with dietary creatine markedly ameliorated both disease severity and inflammatory responses in colitis models. Further, enzymes of the PCr/CK metabolic shuttle demonstrate dysregulated mucosal expression in a subset of ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease patients. These findings establish a role for HIF-regulated CK in epithelial homeostasis and reveal a fundamental link between cellular bioenergetics and mucosal barrier.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is controversy about nutrition status and calorie needs during phases of active versus inactive adult Crohn's disease (CD). Results have been reported in cross-sectional studies, but longitudinal data are unavailable. Our aim was to explore whether disease activity had an impact on resting energy expenditure (REE) and body composition in adult patients with CD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients were studied on 2 occasions with active and inactive CD. REE was measured by indirect calorimetry. Body composition was estimated from bioelectrical impedance analysis. Disease activity was measured using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Regression analyses of REE with CDAI score, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also performed. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were included. Patients with active CD had increased REE/body weight compared with patients with inactive disease (28.8 +/- 5.4 vs 25.9 +/- 4.3 kcal/kg, P < .001). Disease behavior and location, but not sex, had an impact on REE/body weight. Body mass index was lower in active disease than in remission (17.4 +/- 3.0 vs 18.1 +/- 2.6 kg/m(2), P = .010). Body composition was not affected by disease behavior or location. CONCLUSION: Patients with remission had a better nutrition status and decreased REE compared with those with active CD. REE could also be affected by disease location and behavior.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: In most cases celiac disease (CD) is successfully treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, some patients become refractory to the GFD. Refractory CD (RCD) patients have an increased risk for developing enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma and early diagnosis is therefore of importance. Currently, RCD diagnosis relies on endoscopy and adequate serological markers are lacking. Antibodies against glycoprotein-2 (GP2A) were described in Crohn's disease (CrD) and active CD but not in ulcerative colitis (UC), suggesting this is a specific marker for small intestinal lesions. METHODS: Sera obtained from patients visiting our outpatient clinic for routine serological tests for diagnosis and/or follow-up of inflammatory bowel disease (n=78), active CD (n=45), GFD (n=34) and RCD (n=15) were analysed for GP2A titres. RESULTS: Increased GP2A-IgA levels in CrD and active CD as compared to controls (p<0.001) and lack thereof in UC was confirmed. However, we could not confirm the association with small bowel localization within the CrD patient group. Within CD patients, we demonstrated a significant decrease of GP2A-IgA titres upon a GFD and increased levels in RCD patients as compared to patients on a GFD. Although GP2A-IgA was not associated with the degree of villous atrophy, GP2A-IgA levels were able to distinguish RCD patients from GFD patients (ROC AUC=0.79, p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Follow-up of GP2A-IgA titres in CD patients on a GFD may help to identify patients at risk for developing RCD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity has been associated with a more severe disease course in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and epidemiological data identified dietary fats but not obesity as risk factors for the development of IBD. Crohn's disease is one of the two major IBD phenotypes and mostly affects the terminal ileum. Despite recent observations that high fat diets (HFD) impair intestinal barrier functions and drive pathobiont selection relevant for chronic inflammation in the colon, mechanisms of high fat diets in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease are not known. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of HFD on the development of chronic ileal inflammation in a murine model of Crohn's disease-like ileitis. METHODS: TNF(DeltaARE/WT) mice and wildtype C57BL/6 littermates were fed a HFD compared to control diet for different durations. Intestinal pathology and metabolic parameters (glucose tolerance, mesenteric tissue characteristics) were assessed. Intestinal barrier integrity was characterized at different levels including polyethylene glycol (PEG) translocation, endotoxin in portal vein plasma and cellular markers of barrier function. Inflammatory activation of epithelial cells as well as immune cell infiltration into ileal tissue were determined and related to luminal factors. RESULTS: HFD aggravated ileal inflammation but did not induce significant overweight or typical metabolic disorders in TNF(DeltaARE/WT). Expression of the tight junction protein Occludin was markedly reduced in the ileal epithelium of HFD mice independently of inflammation, and translocation of endotoxin was increased. Epithelial cells showed enhanced expression of inflammation-related activation markers, along with enhanced luminal factors-driven recruitment of dendritic cells and Th17-biased lymphocyte infiltration into the lamina propria. CONCLUSIONS: HFD feeding, independently of obesity, accelerated disease onset of small intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease-relevant mouse model through mechanisms that involve increased intestinal permeability and altered luminal factors, leading to enhanced dendritic cell recruitment and promoted Th17 immune responses.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: 25(OH) vitamin D levels may be low in patients with moderately or severely active inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn's disease and Idiopathic Ulcerative Colitis) but this is less clear in patients with mild or inactive IBD. Furthermore there is limited information of any family influence on 25(OH) vitamin D levels in IBD. As a possible risk factor we hypothesize that vitamin D levels may also be low in families of IBD patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate 25[OH] vitamin D levels in patients with IBD in remission or with mild activity. A second objective is to evaluate whether there are relationships within IBD family units of 25[OH] vitamin D and what are the influences associated with these levels. METHODS: Participants underwent medical history, physical examination and a 114 item diet questionnaire. Serum 25[OH] vitamin D was measured, using a radioimmunoassay kit, (replete >/= 75, insufficient 50-74, deficient < 25-50, or severely deficient < 25 nmol/L). Associations between 25[OH] vitamin D and twenty variables were evaluated using univariate regression. Multivariable analysis was also applied and intrafamilial dynamics were assessed. RESULTS: 55 patients and 48 controls with their respective families participated (N206). 25[OH] vitamin D levels between patients and controls were similar (71.2 +/- 32.8 vs. 68.3 +/-26.2 nmol/L). Vitamin D supplements significantly increased intake but correlation with serum 25[OH] vitamin D was significant only during non sunny months among patients. Within family units, patients' families had mean replete levels (82.3 +/- 34.2 nmol/L) and a modest correlation emerged during sunny months between patients and family (r2 =0.209 p = 0.032). These relationships were less robust and non significant in controls and their families. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild or inactive IBD 25[OH] vitamin D levels are less than ideal but are similar to controls. Taken together collectively, the results of this study suggest that patient family dynamics may be different in IBD units from that in control family units. However contrary to the hypothesis, intra familial vitamin D dynamics do not pose additional risks for development of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enteral nutritional therapy (EN) is an effective modality for inducing and maintaining remission in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The standard protocol for EN provides patients with 100% of their caloric needs for induction of remission. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of delivering 80% to 90% of patient's caloric needs through EN, to induce remission in pediatric patients with CD. This approach allows patients to consume remaining calories from a normal diet. METHODS: A retrospective review of charts from 1998 to 2010 was conducted at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Remission (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index <10) and response (decrease in Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index score of >/=12.5 points) were calculated before and after treatment with EN. Weight z scores and laboratory parameters were evaluated in all participants. RESULTS: Forty-three charts were evaluated. Mean age of participants was 12.8 years (5.1-17.4), 67% were male and 33% female patients. Remission and response were evaluated in a group of 23 participants, with no missing data. There were reductions in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P < 0.0001) and C-reactive protein (P < 0.02), and increases in albumin (P < 0.03). Mean Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index score at baseline was 26.9 and was reduced to a score of 10.2 at follow-up (P < 0.0001). Induction of remission was achieved in 65% and response in 87% at a mean follow-up of 2 months (1-4 months). CONCLUSIONS: This novel EN protocol seems to be effective for the induction of remission in pediatric patients with CD and contributes to increasing weight and improving laboratory markers. This protocol may result in improved EN acceptance and compliance and will be evaluated prospectively.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. The two main forms of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. According to the recent concept the disease is caused by a combination of factors, including genetics, immune dysregulation, barrier dysfunction and the change in microbial flora. Environmental factors, such as changes in diet, antibiotic use, smoking or improved domestic hygiene (e.g. eradication of intestinal helminths) probably contribute to the development and increased prevalence of IBD. Dysregulation of mucosal immunity in IBD causes an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines which resulted in uncontrolled intestinal inflammation. Based on extensive research over the last decade, besides the conventional therapy, there are several novel pathways and specific targets, on which focus new therapeutics. New therapeutics aim 1./ to correct genetic susceptibility by stimulating NOD2 expression, TLR3 signaling or inhibition of TLR4 pathway, 2./ to restore the immune dysregulation by inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21), Th1 polarisation (IL-2, IL-12, IL-23, IFN-gamma ), T-cell activation, leukocyte adhesion, as well as by immunostimulation (GM-CSF, G-CSF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-11, IFN-beta-1a), 3./ to restore mucosal barrier function and stimulate mucosal healing by different growth factors, such as GH, EGF, KGF, TGF-beta, VEGF, 4./ to restore the normal bacterial flora by antibiotics, probiotics. However, in spite of these numerous potential targets, the true value and clinical significance of most of the new biologics and molecules are not clear yet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), although whether this impairs immune responsiveness, and is related to disease activity per se, remains unclear. We sought to investigate vitamin D pathways in patients with CD according to measures of inflammation and immune response. METHODS: Prospectively collected samples of a well-characterized cohort of patients with CD were used to measure serum 25(OH)-vitamin D levels by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Related gene expression was determined by polymerase chain reaction in T cells. The effect of vitamin D on the proliferation of isolated CD4 cells was determined. RESULTS: Patients with active CD had lower serum vitamin D levels than those in clinical remission; this measurement was independent of season or reported use of vitamin D supplements. Harvey-Bradshaw Index scores, but not C-reactive protein, correlated with serum vitamin D levels. Gene expression of the vitamin D receptor was higher in peripheral blood T cells from patients with active disease than in those in remission. The proportion of CD25hi CD4 cells from patients with CD increased in the presence of vitamin D. After treatment with infliximab, significant increases in serum vitamin D levels were noted in patients. CONCLUSIONS: Low vitamin D levels are associated with disease activity in CD and increase after infliximab treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has risen rapidly in China over the last 15 years. Increasing numbers of people with IBD require surgery during their lifetime, but few reports of IBD in Eastern populations have been described to date. The aim of this study was to assess the short-term effects of the laparoscopic surgery for IBD in Chinese patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 2010 to March 2012, 35 patients with IBD underwent laparoscopic operations and the clinical data obtained for these patients were reviewed. RESULTS: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) (N = 21) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (N = 14) underwent laparoscopic surgery. In the CD group, the mean age was 37.4 years. Two patients (9.5%) required conversion to an open procedure. The median length of postoperative hospitalization was 9 (7-40) days. Overall morbidity was 26.3% and no patients required re-operation. In the UC group, the mean age was 55.2 years. The conversion rate was 14.3% (2/14). The median time to regular diet was 4 (3-10) days and the median length of postoperative hospitalization was 8 (7-25) days. Four patients developed postoperative complications and one patient developed ileostomy retraction requiring urgent operative intervention to rebuild the stoma. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery in patients with IBD can be accomplished safely and with reasonable operative times, conversion rates and morbidity rates. The main advantages of the laparoscopic approach are rapid recovery, improved cosmesis, less postoperative pain, and patient satisfaction.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The interaction between a disturbed microbial composition, the intestinal mucosal barrier and the mucosal immune system plays an important role in IBD and its chronicity. It has been indicated that due to the altered microbial composition the balance between T regulatory cells (Treg) and T helper cells (Th) 17 is disturbed, leading to an inflammatory state. The present study shows that oral intake of a specific multi fibre mix (MF), designed to match the fibre content of a healthy diet, counteracts IBD-like intestinal inflammation and weight loss in dextran sodium sulphate treated mice. This reduction in inflammation might be brought about, at least in part, by the MF-induced decrease in inflammatory cytokines, increase in IL-10 and the relative increase in Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Moreover, the Treg percentage in the MLN correlates with the percentage of tolerogenic lamina propria derived CD103+RALDH+dendritic cells in the MLN, suggesting that these play a role in the observed effects. In children with CD exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a widely used safe and effective therapy. Optimizing enteral nutritional concepts with the tested fibre mix, know to modulate the gut microbiota composition, SCFA production and inflammatory status (as indicated by the present study) could possibly further improve efficacy in inducing remission.},

   abstract = {A 27-year-old man was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy and Crohn's disease. He had been diagnosed with proteinuria and hematuria since he was 20 years old. Diarrhea had been a continuing problem during the past 5 months. Neither corticosteroid therapy nor tonsillectomy was performed. Hemodialysis was required at age of 30, while the symptoms of Crohn's disease were ameliorated by an elemental diet. He received a renal transplant from his mother 4 months after starting dialysis therapy. The initial immunosuppression therapy consisted of methylprednisolone, mycofenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, and basiliximab. Eight months after transplantation, proteinuria and hematuria appeared and serum creatinine was 1.4 mg/dL. Relapse of IgA nephropathy was confirmed by the one-year protocol biopsy. He had suffered from tonsillitis at 32 months after the transplantation. Urinary protein increased to 3 g/day and serum creatinine was elevated to 2.04 mg/dL. Renal biopsy was performed 2 weeks after the urinary findings were aggravated. The cellular crescents constituted 36 % of the glomeruli. The findings of rejection were not confirmed in both biopsies. Tonsillectomy was performed thereafter. No additional immunosuppressive therapy was added. Proteinuria and hematuria disappeared at 4 and 20 months, respectively, after tonsillectomy, even when the symptoms of Crohn's disease worsened 69 months and 89 months after transplantation. A renal biopsy was performed 101 months after transplantation. Although IgA in the mesangium area was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining, no active lesion was seen. Tonsillectomy along with immunosuppressants for the graft might be an effective treatment for some patients with active recurrent IgA nephropathy.},

Sixty percent of Crohn's disease patients have sarcopenia. However some inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are obese or suffer from sarcopenic-obesity. IBD patients have many vitamin and nutrient deficiencies, which can lead to important consequences such as hyperhomocysteinemia, which is associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic disease. Nutritional deficiencies in IBD patients are the result of insufficient intake, malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy as well as metabolic disturbances directly induced by the chronic disease and its treatments, in particular corticosteroids. Screening for nutritional deficiencies in chronic disease patients is warranted. Managing the deficiencies involves simple nutritional guidelines, vitamin supplements, and nutritional support in the worst cases.},

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study using a GFD questionnaire in 1647 patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) participating in the CCFA Partners longitudinal Internet-based cohort. RESULTS: A diagnosis of celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity were reported by 10 (0.6%) and 81 (4.9%) respondents, respectively. Three hundred fourteen (19.1%) participants reported having previously tried a GFD and 135 (8.2%) reported current use of GFD. Overall 65.6% of all patients, who attempted a GFD, described an improvement of their gastrointestinal symptoms and 38.3% reported fewer or less severe IBD flares. In patients currently attempting a GFD, excellent adherence was associated with significant improvement of fatigue (P < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In this large group of patients with IBD, a substantial number had attempted a GFD, of whom the majority had some form of improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms. Testing a GFD in clinical practice in patients with significant intestinal symptoms, which are not solely explained by the degree of intestinal inflammation, has the potential to be a safe and highly efficient therapeutic approach. Further prospective studies into mechanisms of gluten sensitivity in IBD are warranted.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Intractable diarrhea of infancy (IDI), a group of prolonged diarrheal disorders, is difficult to diagnose and manage. We documented general features of patients and the causes of IDI. METHODS: The present retrospective study included 60 hospitalized patients with IDI ages 0 to 24 months during January 2000 to December 2010. Detailed history, laboratory and endoscopic findings, diagnoses, and clinical courses were reviewed. Descriptive analyses were used for statistical evaluation. RESULTS: The male/female ratio was 1.4. The median age at onset of diarrhea was 12 days. A total of 70% and 11% of patients were severely and moderately malnourished, respectively. Carbohydrate malabsorption (CM) and food allergies (n = 11, 18% for both) were the most frequent causes. A total of 16 of the patients (27%) did not have a specific diagnosis. The other diagnoses were infections (n = 5), immune-mediated disorders (IMD) (n = 6), congenital enterocyte defects (CED) (n = 3, 5%), short bowel syndrome (n = 2), cystic fibrosis (n = 2), intestinal pseudoobstruction (n = 1), congenital disorder of glycosylation (n = 1), abetalipoproteinemia (n = 1), and proprotein convertase (PC) 1 deficiency (n = 1). Stool calprotectin level was high in 10 of 19 patients with Crohn disease (n = 3, mean 1116 +/- 851 mg/L), food allergy (n = 4, mean 516 +/- 288 mg/L), and undefined etiology (n = 3, mean 616 +/- 780 mg/L). The mean duration of hospitalization was 76 days. CONCLUSIONS: IDI is a heterogeneous group of diarrheal disorders. The most frequent causes were CM and food allergies in our study. Because high levels of calprotectin support inflammation, calprotectin levels may help to discriminate CED and inflammatory causes of IDI.},

METHODS: A cohort of 220 IBD patients including 141 Crohn's disease (CD) and 79 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients was followed-up at a tertiary IBD center. A subgroup of the cohort (n = 26) took VD supplements for > 3 mo. Health related quality of life was assessed using the short IBD questionnaire (sIBDQ). VD serum concentration and sIBDQ score were assessed between August and October 2012 (summer/autumn period) and between February and April 2013 (winter/spring period). The mean VD serum concentration and its correlation with disease activity of CD were determined for each season separately. In a subgroup of patients, the effects of VD supplementation on winter VD serum concentration, change in VD serum concentration from summer to winter, and winter sIBDQ score were analyzed. RESULTS: During the summer/autumn and the winter/spring period, 28% and 42% of IBD patients were VD-deficient (< 20 ng/mL), respectively. In the winter/spring period, there was a significant correlation between sIBDQ score and VD serum concentration in UC patients (r = 0.35, P = 0.02), with a trend towards significance in CD patients (r = 0.17, P = 0.06). In the winter/spring period, VD-insufficient patients (< 30 ng/mL) had a significantly lower mean sIBDQ score than VD-sufficient patients; this was true of both UC (48.3 +/- 2.3 vs 56.7 +/- 3.4, P = 0.04) and CD (55.7 +/- 1.25 vs 60.8 +/- 2.14, P = 0.04) patients. In all analyzed scenarios (UC/CD, the summer/autumn period and the winter/spring period), health related quality of life was the highest in patients with VD serum concentrations of 50-59 ng/mL. Supplementation with a median of 800 IU/d VD day did not influence VD serum concentration or the sIBDQ score. CONCLUSION: VD serum concentration correlated with health related quality of life in UC and CD patients during the winter/spring period.},

On the contrary, effect of omega-3-PUFA on Crohn's disease remained controversial. That effect of omega-3 PUFA differs according to the location of inflamed intestine was hypothesized. To elucidate this hypothesis, to investigate the role of dietary fat on disease activity in different kind of murine models of intestinal inflammatory diseases was planned. The effect of omega-3 PUFA on small intestinal Crohn's disease model and large intestinal Crohn's disease model of mice. Chronic colitis model C57BL/6 mice received two cycles of dextran sodium sulfate solution treatment to induce chronic colitis. Feeding of omega-3 fat-rich diets exacerbated colitis with decrease in adiponectin expression. Chronic small intestinal inflammation model: SAMP1/Yit mice showed remarkable inflammation of the terminal ileum spontaneously. Feeding of omega-3 fat-rich diets for 16 weeks significantly ameliorated the inflammation of the terminal ileum. Enhanced infiltration of leukocytes and expression of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 in intestinal mucosa was significantly decreased by omega-3 fat-rich diets treatment. Omega-3 PUFA has dual role, pro-/anti-inflammatory, on intestinal inflammatory diseases. The role of omega-3 fat and the potential for immunonutrition in inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract will be discussed.},

   abstract = {Patients have strong beliefs about the role of diet in the cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and in exacerbating or alleviating ongoing symptoms from IBD. The rapid increase in the incidence and prevalence of IBD in recent decades strongly suggests an environmental trigger for IBD, one of which may be dietary patterns. There are several pathways where diet may influence intestinal inflammation, such as direct dietary antigens, altering the gut microbiome, and affecting gastrointestinal permeability. However, data that altering diet can change the natural history of IBD are scarce, and evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD are lacking. Patients, therefore, seek nonmedical resources for dietary guidance, such as patient support groups and unverified sources on the Internet. The aim of this review is to identify patient-targeted dietary recommendations for IBD and to critically appraise the nutritional value of these recommendations. We review patient-targeted dietary information for IBD from structured Internet searches and popular defined diets. Patient-targeted dietary recommendations focus on food restrictions and are highly conflicting. High-quality dietary intervention studies are needed to facilitate creation of evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The base of human Peyer patches of the terminal ileum has been noted to contain black granular pigment deposits, composed of titanium dioxide and aluminosilicate, which are food additives typically present in a Western diet, and pharmaceuticals. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of exogenous pigment throughout the gastrointestinal tract of children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the correlation between their age and the presence and amount of pigment in Peyer patches, and its relation to pediatric IBD. METHODS: Biopsies (upper and lower gastrointestinal tract) from children suspected of having IBD who underwent endoscopy, were reassessed by a blinded, expert pathologist. The amount of pigment in biopsies was scored using a semiquantitative scale (range 0 to +++). RESULTS: A total of 151 children were included: 62 with Crohn disease (CD), 26 with ulcerative colitis, and 63 with non-IBD. In 63 children (42%), deposits of black pigment were found only in biopsies from the terminal ileum, located in Peyer patches. A significant correlation was found between increasing age and the amount of pigment (P = 0.004). Pigment deposits were found significantly less in the patients with CD compared with those in patients with ulcerative colitis and those with non-IBD (26% vs 62% and 49%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for the hypothesis that the amount of pigment, only present in Peyer patches in the terminal ileum, becomes denser with increasing age. Absence of pigment in Peyer patches in a higher number of patients with CD suggests that microparticles may have become involved in the inflammatory process, possibly because of disrupted autophagy.},

METHODS: We undertook a prospective, questionnaire based, cross-sectional cohort study to evaluate the presence or absence of SpA simultaneously in both CD and non-CD cohorts. RESULTS: 356/590 (60.3%) patients with CD participated in this study. 99% had diagnosis confirmed by a diagnostic test (79% small bowel biopsy, 19.8% blood test, 3.9% stool test). Approximately 131 (37%) cases of arthritis were reported in CD patients. Of the 6/356 CD patients with seronegative spondyloarthritides, four had sacroiliitis, two ankylosing spondylitis, and one psoriatic arthritis, compared to one ankylosing spondylitis and five psoriatic arthritis in non-CD. Osteoarthritis (89 vs 59, P = 0.93) was the most common diagnosis reported by respondents. More CD patients with diarrhea (94%) and anemia (81%) improved on GFD, compared to arthritis symptoms (30%). Autoimmune thyroiditis (10.6% vs 0.4%), insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (2.2% vs 1.7%), systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) (1.1% vs 0), and psoriasis (12.9% vs 5.5%) occurred more frequently in CD patients. The prevalence of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, Sjogren's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis was around 1% each. Univariate Logistic regression analysis showed </= high school education (odds ratio [OR] 2.01, P < 0.003), age >/= 60 years (OR 4.13, P < 0.001), and osteoporosis (OR 2.78, P < 0.001) to be significantly associated with report of arthritis in CD patients. CONCLUSION: We did not find a high rate of SpA in CD patients. In contrast, increased rates of autoimmune thyroiditis, SLE, IDDM, and psoriasis were seen in CD.},

   abstract = {Carnitine is a vitamin-like compound that plays important roles in fatty acid beta-oxidation and the control of the mitochondrial coenzyme A/acetyl-CoA ratio. However, carnitine is not added to ordinary enteral nutrition or total parenteral nutrition. In this study, we determined the serum carnitine concentrations in subjects receiving ordinary enteral nutrition (EN) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases to compare its levels with those of other nutritional markers. Serum samples obtained from 11 EN and 11 TPN patients and 82 healthy controls were examined. In addition, 10 Crohn's disease and 10 ulcerative colitis patients with malnutrition who were barely able to ingest an ordinary diet were also evaluated. Carnitine and its derivatives were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The carnitine concentrations in EN and TPN subjects were significantly lower compared with those of the control subjects. Neither the serum albumin nor the total cholesterol level was correlated with the carnitine concentration, although a significant positive correlation was found between the serum albumin and total cholesterol levels. Indeed, patients with CD and UC showed significantly reduced serum albumin and/or total cholesterol levels, but their carnitine concentrations remained normal. In conclusion, only a complete blockade of an ordinary diet, such as EN or TPN, caused a reduction in the serum carnitine concentration. Serum carnitine may be an independent biomarker of malnutrition, and its supplementation is needed in EN and TPN subjects even if their serum albumin and total cholesterol levels are normal.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To identify environmental risk factors for developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children <15 years of age. METHODS: IBD patients and randomly selected healthy controls from a well defined geographical area in Denmark were prospectively recruited in the period 1.1.2007-31.12.2009. Data regarding socioeconomic status, area of residence, living conditions, infections and diet were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 118 IBD patients (59 Crohn's disease (CD), 56 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 IBD unclassified (IBDU)) and 477 healthy controls filled out the questionnaire. The response rates were 91% in patients and 45% in controls, respectively. Several risk factors for IBD were identified: IBD in first degree relatives (IBD: OR (odds ratio): 6.1 (95%CI: 2.5-15.0), CD (OR: 6.8 (2.3-20.2)) and UC (OR: 6.1 (2.3-16.0))); bedroom sharing (IBD: OR: 2.1 (1.0-4.3), CD (OR: 3.6 (1.3-9.4))); high sugar intake (IBD: OR: 2.5 (1.0-6.2), CD (OR: 2.9 (1.0-8.5))); prior admission to a hospital for gastrointestinal infections (IBD: 7.7 (3.1-19.1), CD (7.9 (2.5-24.9)) and UC (7.4 (2.5-21.6))); stressful events (IBD: 1.7 (1.0-2.9)). Protective factors were daily vs. less than daily vegetable consumption (CD: 0.3 (0.1-1.0), UC (0.3 (0.1-0.8))) and whole meal bread consumption (IBD: OR: 0.5 (0.3-0.9), CD (0.4 (0.2-0.9))). An increased risk of diagnosis of CD compared to UC was shown for patients living in more urban areas (OR: 1.3 (1.1-1.6)). CONCLUSION: We identified several risk and protective factors for developing IBD. Studies on the influence of environmental factors are important in our understanding of aetiology and phenotypes of paediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to compare the generic and ostomy-specific quality of life (QoL) between cancer and non-cancer ostomy patients using a mixed-method design. METHODS: All patients with an ostomy participating in the Stomapanel of the Dutch Ostomy Association were asked to complete a generic (RAND-36) and ostomy-specific (Stoma-QoL) QoL questionnaire. In addition, open-ended questions on symptoms, restrictions or adaptations influencing daily life were included. The generic and ostomy-specific QoL between cancer and non-cancer ostomy patients were compared using linear regression analyses. Qualitative responses were analysed using content analysis. RESULTS: In total, 668 patients were included: 379 cancer patients (80 % colorectal, 17 % bladder and 3 % other) and 289 non-cancer patients (38 % colitis ulcerosa, 22 % Crohn's disease and 40 % other) with a colostomy (55 %), ileostomy (31 %) and/or urostomy (16 %). Adjusted for gender, age, type of ostomy and time elapsed since ostomy surgery, cancer ostomy patients scored higher (better) on Stoma-QoL (beta = 2.1) and all RAND-36 domains (9.1 < beta </= 19.5) except on mental health compared to non-cancer ostomy patients. Of the 33 themes coded for in the content analysis, fatigue or sleeplessness, leakages, pain, bladder or bowel complaints, physical functioning or activity, travelling or being away from home, other daily activities (including work), clothing and diet were among the 10 most frequently reported themes, although ranking differed between both patient groups. Besides, cancer ostomy patients frequently reported on the impact on (engaging in a) relationship or sexual intimacy and non-cancer ostomy patients frequently reported to be relieved of symptoms and restrictions in daily life. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients reported better generic and ostomy-specific QoL than non-cancer ostomy patients. In both cancer and non-cancer ostomy patients, fatigue or sleeplessness, leakages, pain, bladder or bowel complaints, physical functioning or activity, travelling or being away from home, other daily activities (including work), clothing and diet were among the 10 most common reported themes influencing daily life. However, the ranking of these 10 most common themes was different in both patient groups.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested to be associated with high risk of Crohn's disease (CD). In France, where food fortification is limited, the major source of vitamin D is through sun exposure. The aim of this work was to analyze the relationship between residential sun exposure and the risk of incident CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The E3N cohort consists of women living in France, aged 40 to 65 years and free of major diseases at inclusion in 1990. Among the 91,870 women included in the study, we identified 123 incident cases (45 CD, 71 UC, and 7 indeterminate colitis). To assess residential sun exposure, we used a database containing mean daily ultraviolet radiation (UVR) dose for each French county. The relationship between residential sun exposure and risk of incident inflammatory bowel diseases was explored using Cox models. RESULTS: Higher levels of residential sun exposure were associated with a significant decreased risk of CD (hazard ratio [HR] for the third versus the first tertile of UVR dose, 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23-1.01; P for trend = 0.04), but not of UC (HR, 1.21; CI, 0.61-2.11). In women with available data on dietary vitamin D intake, we observed a lower risk of CD with higher residential UVR (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.80; P for trend = 0.01). Dietary vitamin D intake was neither associated with the risk of CD (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.14-1.24; P for trend = 0.14) nor UC (HR, 1.61; CI, 0.61-4.23). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective cohort of women, high residential sunlight exposure was associated with decreased incidence of CD, but not UC.},

Here we found that the numbers of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were reduced significantly in Nod2(-/-) mice and the residual IELs displayed reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. Further study showed that NOD2 signaling maintained IELs via recognition of gut microbiota and IL-15 production. Notably, recovery of IELs by adoptive transfer could reduce the susceptibility of Nod2(-/-) mice to the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Our results demonstrate that recognition of gut microbiota by NOD2 is important to maintain the homeostasis of IELs and provide a clue that may link NOD2 variation to the impaired innate immunity and higher susceptibility in CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease prevalence increases with increasing latitude. Because most vitamin D comes from sunlight exposure and murine models of intestinal inflammation have demonstrated beneficial effects of 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D treatment, we hypothesised that Crohn's disease activity is associated with low vitamin D levels. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 182 CD patients and 62 healthy controls, we measured serum 25-OH vitamin D. Stratified analysis was used to compare 25-OH vitamin D levels with Crohn's disease activity index, C-reactive protein, smoking status, intake of oral vitamin D supplements and seasonal variation in CD patients and healthy controls. RESULTS: Serum 25-OH vitamin D was inversely associated with disease activity: Median 25-OH vitamin D levels of Crohn's disease in remission, mildly, and moderately active diseases evaluated by Crohn's disease activity index were 64, 49, and 21 nmol/l (p<0.01) and by CRP 68, 76, and 35 nmol/l (p<0.05), respectively. Patients who took oral vitamin D supplementation had lower Crohn's disease activity index (p<0.05) and C-reactive protein (p=0.07) than non-users. Crohn's disease patients who smoked had lower vitamin D levels (51 nmol/l) than patients who did not smoke (76 nmol/l), p<0.01. Overall, Crohn's disease patients did not differ from healthy controls regarding 25-OH vitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: Active Crohn's disease was associated with low serum 25-OH vitamin D. Patients who smoked had lower 25-OH vitamin D levels than patients who did not smoke, independently of disease activity.},

Inflammatory bowel disease or IBD is divided into ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. One of the problems that can occur with UC is dietary allergy to some foods. This study aimed to evaluated the dairy allergy among patients with ulcerative colitis. This study is a Case - control study, that studied 72 patients with Ulcerative Colitis, after recording history of the disease, colonoscopy and confirmed by biopsy and 72 person without history of colitis. In this study, in order to investigate of food allergy, used of the EUROMMUM kit with an international code number DP3420-1601-11E. We used chi-square and Monte Carlo method for analysis of data. Among UC patients, 30.6% mild, 52.8% moderate and 16.6% of cases were in sever stage. 9.7% of them reported a history of abdominal surgery due to disease. According to the chi-square and Monte Carlo methods, dairy allergy (including: cow milk, cow milk UHT and casein) in UC group was significant (P=0.00). This study indicated that there is significant relationship between UC and cow milk, cow milk UHT and casein. UC patients who are allergic to dairy products and the use of dairy products can increase the severity of UC.},

The interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10 KO) mouse is a well-established murine model of IBD which develops spontaneous intestinal inflammation that resembles Crohn's disease. In the present study, human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) were administrated to IL-10 KO mice to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of hAMSCs that may attenuate the progress of or treat IBD. After IBD was induced by feeding the IL-10 KO mouse a 125-250 ppm piroxicam mixed diet for 1 week, 2x10(6) hAMSCs were injected into the peritoneum and the mice were switched to a normal diet. After 1 week, the mice were sacrificed and tissue samples were harvested. Tissue scores for inflammation and inflammation-related genes expression were determined. The hAMSC-treated group showed significantly reduced inflammatory changes in histological analysis. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that RANTES, Toll-like receptor 9, and IL-4 expression levels were not significantly different between the groups while IL-12, INF-gamma, and TNF-alpha levels were significantly decreased in the hAMSC treated group. hAMSC attenuated IBD in the IL-10 KO mice by suppressing inflammatory cytokine expression, was mediated by the type 1 helper T cell pathway. Even though only a single injection of hAMSCs was delivered, the effect influenced chronic events associated with inflammatory changes and demonstrated that hAMSCs are a powerful candidate for IBD therapy.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic disease thought to be caused by a dysregulated immune response to host intestinal microflora. The role of genetic factors is indicated by familial clustering of cases and higher incidence in monozygotic twins. An interaction between genetic and environmental factors is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Changes in diet, antibiotic use and intestinal colonization have likely contributed to increased prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease in the past century. Environmental factors or infections are thought to alter the barrier function of the epithelium, leading to loss of immune tolerance to intestinal antigens. This loss of tolerance activates dendritic cells, triggering their transport to mesenteric lymph nodes, where they promote differentiation of naive T cells to TH-1, TH-2, TH-17 cells or T regulatory cells. Production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines then follows. Circulating effector and regulatory cells enter the intestine through a highly selective mechanism that involves interaction with the vascular endothelium, diapedesis through the vessel wall and migration to the lamina propria. There are several genes implicated in IBD. Mutations in certain genes can cause defective down regulation of the innate immune response, ineffective clearance of intracellular bacteria and proliferation of both luminal and mucosal-adherent commensal bacteria. IBD is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition that is immune mediated. Results from research in animal models, human genetics, basic science and clinical trials provide evidence that it is heterogeneous, characterized by various genetic abnormalities, leading to a dysregulated and overly aggressive T cell response to commensal enteric bacteria. Different genetic abnormalities can be characterized as causing defects in mucosal barrier function, immunoregulation or bacterial clearance. Advances in our understanding of the interplay between components of innate and adaptive immune response will be central to future progress.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Loss of response (LOR) to infliximab (IFX) has become an important clinical issue for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Elemental diet (ED) therapy has been established as a nutrition therapy for CD in Japan. ED therapy can reduce antigen exposure and is both efficacious and safe. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of concomitant ED therapy in maintaining regular IFX infusion in patients with CD. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 125 patients with luminal CD treated with scheduled IFX maintenance therapy with a regular dosage. Patients were classified into two groups: the ED group with intake >/= 900 kcal/day and the non-ED group with intake <900 kcal/day. When clinical LOR was detected on the basis of disease activity, laboratory parameters, or endoscopic findings, the physician discontinued the infusion schedule of IFX. We investigated the efficacy of ED therapy for sustaining the scheduled IFX maintenance therapy. RESULTS: With the exception of ED intake, no significant differences were found in patient characteristics between the ED group and the non-ED group. The ED group was significantly superior to the non-ED group (p = 0.049) in sustaining scheduled IFX maintenance therapy. It is well known that ED therapy is more effective for small bowel lesions than colonic lesions in CD. When comparing ileitis and ileocolitis patients with CD, the ED group was significantly superior to the non-ED group (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant ED therapy is effective in maintaining scheduled IFX maintenance therapy in patients with luminal CD in order to prevent LOR.},

Although biologic agents targeting the immune system have been effective in patients with IBD, cessation of treatment leads to relapse in the majority of patients, suggesting that intrinsic immune dysregulation is an effect, not a cause, of IBD. Dramatic changes in the environment, resulting in the dysregulated composition of intestinal microbiota or dysbiosis, may be associated with the fundamental causes of IBD. Japan now has upgraded water supply and sewerage systems, as well as dietary habits and antibiotic overuse that are similar to such features found in developed Western countries.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between dyslipidemia and the prevalence of colon polyps including colon adenoma as a precancerous lesion of colonic neoplasms. METHODS: We selected subjects undergoing a colonoscopy for health screening at the Health Promotion Center of Eulji General Hospital from January 2006 to June 2010. Subjects with histories of cancers, dyslipidemia treatment, and other intestinal diseases like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were excluded. The total numbers of subjects included in the study was 605. Chi-square test and t-test and were used for the analysis. Additionally we used multivariate logistic regression to adjust for sex, age, smoking, drinking, and other risk factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of colon polyps was 48.70% and 28.05% in males and females, respectively. When adjusting for variables that included age, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, drinking, and exercise, dyslipidemia was not significantly associated with the prevalence of colon polyps. However upon analyzing adenomatous colon polyps in men, dyslipidemias due to triglycerides and high density lipoproteins were significant factors (odds ratio [OR], 2.13; confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 3.98; OR, 2.24; CI, 1.15 to 4.34, respectively). CONCLUSION: Dyslipidemia was not a significant factor in the prevalence of colon polyps. However it had a significant association with the prevalence of adenomatous colon polyps in men.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Vitamin D has immune modulating effects and normal to high levels might be correlated with less severe Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to review seasonal vitamin D levels in CD patients in correlation with disease activity. METHODS: CD patients were identified from an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) database and given two questionnaires enquiring about vitamin D supplementation, sun exposure, sunblock application and symptoms to complete the CDAI. Participants were examined and serum 25-OH vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and haematocrit were determined in winter (06/2011-09/2011) and summer (12/2011-03/2012). Patients taking vitamin D supplements or with extensive small bowel resection were excluded. RESULTS: 32 patients (19 women, mean age 39 plus or minus 16 years, range 18-73 years), from Dunedin, New Zealand (45 degrees 52' S, 170 degrees 30' E) consented to participate in the study. Of these, three took vitamin D supplements and were excluded. In winter 76% of the participants had serum 25(OH)D levels classified as deficient (<50 nmol/L) and all of them had insufficient 25(OH)D levels (<75 nmol/L). In summer, serum 25(OH)D levels were deficient only in 10% but insufficient in 55% of the participants. Mean serum 25(OH)D level was 35.9 nmol/L (norm 50-150nmol/L) in winter (range 5-67, SD 17.5) and 69.6 nmol/L in summer (range 13-119, SD 19.0) (p<0.0005). There was no significant difference in the seasonal levels of serum 25(OH)D between male and female participants (p=0.601). Mean CDAI score was 103.9 in winter (range -10-262, SD 76.9) and 90.2 in summer (range -13-331, SD 84.0) (p=0.365). A mixed-effects regression analysis showed no statistically significant correlation between seasonal levels of serum 25(OH)D and CDAI (p=0.612) among our study participants. CONCLUSION: Suboptimal levels of serum 25(OH)D were found in the majority of our study participants particularly in winter and they would benefit from supplementation. Our study showed no statistically significant correlation between seasonal serum 25(OH)D levels and CD activity. Given the limitations of the study, the role of 25(OH)D as a predictor of disease activity could not be clearly concluded.},

   abstract = {The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in a wide range of functions and whole body homeostasis. Recent advances have linked microbiota dysbiosis to conditions ranging from Crohn's disease to cancer. The restoration or strengthening of the intestinal microbiota through diet-based approaches such as probiotics and prebiotics has been proposed for combating the onset or progression of these diseases. In this review, we highlight the importance of postbiotics for the manipulation of the intestinal microbiota, with special emphasis on systems biology computational tools and targeted metabolomics for the rational discovery and identification of these bioactive molecules. The identification of novel postbiotics and the pathways responsible for their production should lead to improved mechanistic understanding of the role that specific probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics have in restoring intestinal microbiota composition and function.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) constitute the two major groups of idiopathic disorders in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Environmental factors, genetic factors and immune responses have been considered as the major etiology of IBD. Despite the diversified pathogenesis of the disease, no guaranteed curative therapeutic regimen has been developed so far. This review summarizes the knowledge on the pathophysiology and current treatment approaches of IBD. Since IBD is caused by excessive and tissue- disruptive inflammatory reactions of the gut wall, down-regulation of the immune responses may allow the damaged mucosa to heal and reset the physiological functions of the gut back to normal. Current pharmacotherapy through modulation of neutrophil-derived factors, cytokines, adhesion molecules and reactive oxygen/nitrogen metabolites has been utterly described. Categories of treatment modalities include corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, antibiotics, probiotics, and a series of unique novel agents. The use of anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody (Infliximab), recombinant anti-inflammatory cytokines and related gene therapy has been covered. In addition, discussions on dietary supplementation and heparin treatment are also included. The anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory potential of investigational agents such as nicotine and the filtered protective compounds from tobacco smoke, as well as active herbal medicinal compounds were tested in our previous experimental works, whereas promising findings have been presented here. With the discovery of novel target-oriented agents, more effective and relatively harmless approaches of IBD therapy could be established to achieve a curative outcome. Indeed, more experimental and clinical studies are needed to confirm the relevance of these therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the general population and in patients with chronic diseases has increased markedly in recent decades. We aimed to determine the prevalence, type, and predictors of oral CAM use among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with the general population in a large, population-based, case-control study. METHODS: Overall, 1370 patients with IBD and 598 control subjects in Canterbury, New Zealand, were recruited. Environmental and phenotypic data were obtained through a questionnaire and case note review. Predictors of oral CAM use were identified using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: In the previous year, 44.1% of patients with IBD and 42.3% of control subjects used oral CAM (odds ratio [OR], 1.078; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.885-1.312). The types of oral CAM used most frequently were vitamins (Crohn's disease [CD], 25.2%; ulcerative colitis, 23.7%; control subjects, 24.9%), followed by herbs (CD 15.1%, ulcerative colitis 15.2%, control subjects 12.8%), and dietary supplements (CD, 8.5%; ulcerative colitis 12.6%, control subjects 12.1%). Female gender (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.25-2.08), younger age (P = 0.005), higher education (P = 0.002), higher income (P = 0.04), being a vegetarian (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.97-6.48) and a middle social class at birth (P = 0.024) were independent predictors of oral CAM use in patients with IBD. Disease phenotype was not associated with oral CAM use. In control subjects, female gender (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.85-3.86), higher education (P = 0.003) and a diagnosis of asthma (P = 0.017) predicted oral CAM use. CONCLUSIONS: Oral CAM use is common in, and does not differ between, patients with IBD and the general population in Canterbury, New Zealand. Socio-demographic factors, and not disease phenotype, predict oral CAM use in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {Colonic diseases like ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and colon cancer are on rise due to variations in the dietary and lifestyle habits. Increase in prevalence of such diseases has augmented the interest of researchers in colon targeted drug delivery systems. Polysaccharide coating has emerged as one of the most successful approaches in this direction. Evaluation of such systems, however, demands an efficient dissolution method in terms of convenience, economy, relevance and reproducibility. It is problematic to mimic the dynamic and ecologically diverse features of the colon. A number of dissolution approaches were tried which include incorporation of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, rat caecal contents, human faecal slurries, and multi-stage culture systems. Till date, pursuit for cost-effective and animal-sparing colon-specific bio-relevant dissolution media has been a foremost challenge facing pharmaceutical scientists over many decades. This article reviews various dissolution methods adopted to mimic the in vivo performance of dosage forms that are used for colon targeting. It also highlights limitations of the available methods and conditions that should be taken into account while designing a bio-relevant dissolution method for such systems.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is a high prevalence of low bone mineral density (BMD) among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) although there is a lack of clinical data on the impact of IBD specific medications and recommended vitamin D (VD) and calcium (Ca) supplements on it. DESIGN: The cohort consisted of 150 IBD patients. The average change in BMD at the lumbar spine per year (BMDL/year) was calculated and the impact of clinical characteristics, medications and VD and Ca supplements was analysed. RESULTS: The prevalence of osteopenia was 69/150 (46%) and osteoporosis was identified in 15/150 (10%) patients at baseline. The presence of osteoporosis was associated with the disease duration OR=1.07 per year of disease duration (95% CI=1.01-1.14), p=0.03. The average BMDL/year was 0.010 g/cm(2)/year. Among patients with no IS the BMDL/year was -0.001+/-0.010 g/cm(2)/year, with AZA -0.001+/-0.013 g/cm(2)/year, with anti-TNFalpha 0.003+/-0.006 g/cm(2)/year and with COMBO 0.027+/-0.004 g/cm(2)/year; p<0.05 COMBO vs any other subgroup. BMDL/year among patients treated with CS was -0.031+/-0.012 g/cm(2)/year versus CS free patients 0.013+/-0.004 g/cm(2)/year; p<0.001. There was no effect of VD/Ca supplementation on BMDL. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of low BMD was 55%. Duration of disease was the only independent predictor of low BMD. The BMDL was reduced by high cumulative dose of CS and improved by combined anti-TNFalpha/AZA therapy. The supplementation with recommended doses of VD and Ca had no effect on BMDL.},

   abstract = {Fiber intake is critical for optimal health. This review covers the anti-inflammatory roles of fibers using results from human epidemiological observations, clinical trials, and animal studies. Fiber has body weight-related anti-inflammatory activity. With its lower energy density, a diet high in fiber has been linked to lower body weight, alleviating obesity-induced chronic inflammation evidenced by reduced amounts of inflammatory markers in human and animal studies. Body weight-unrelated anti-inflammatory activity of fiber has also been extensively studied in animal models in which the type and amount of fiber intake can be closely monitored. Fermentable fructose-, glucose-, and galactose-based fibers as well as mixed fibers have shown systemic and local intestinal anti-inflammatory activities when plasma inflammatory markers and tissue inflammation were examined. Similar anti-inflammatory activities have also been demonstrated in some human studies that controlled total fiber intake. The anti-inflammatory activities of synbiotics (probiotics plus fiber) were reviewed as well, but there was no convincing evidence indicating higher efficacy of synbiotics compared with that of fiber alone. Adverse effects have not been observed with the amount of fiber intake or supplementation used in studies, although patients with Crohn's disease may be more sensitive to inulin intake. Several possible mechanisms that may mediate the body weight-unrelated anti-inflammatory activity of fibers are discussed based on the in vitro and in vivo evidence. Fermentable fibers are known to affect the intestinal microbiome. The immunomodulatory role of the intestinal microbiome and/or microbial metabolites could contribute to the systemic and local anti-inflammatory activities of fibers.},

Vegetables, especially Brassicaceae, are often shunned by people with CD because of the negative effects they are alleged to have on their symptoms. Brassicaceae supply key nutrients which are necessary to meet recommended daily intakes. We sought to identify the candidate genes involved in the beneficial or adverse effects of Brassicaceae most commonly eaten, as reported by the New Zealand adults from the "Genes and Diet in Inflammatory Bowel disease Study" based in Auckland. An analysis of associations between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the beneficial or adverse effects of the ten most commonly eaten Brassicaceae was carried out. A total of 37 SNPs were significantly associated with beneficial effects (p = 0.00097 to 0.0497) and 64 SNPs were identified with adverse effects (p = 0.0000751 to 0.049). After correcting for multiple testing, rs7515322 (DIO1) and rs9469220 (HLA) remained significant. Our findings show that the tolerance of some varieties of Brassicaceae may be shown by analysis of a person's genotype.},

METHODS: A computerized search of databases [Cochrane Library, Pubmed/Medline, PsychINFO, and Scopus] through March 2014 was performed. We screened the reference sections of original studies and systematic reviews in English language for CAM in IBD, CD and UC. Randomized controlled trials [RCT] and controlled trials [CT] were referred and assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: A total of: 26 RCT and 3 CT for herbal medicine, eg aloe-vera gel, andrographis paniculata, artemisia absinthium, barley foodstuff, boswellia serrata, cannabis, curcumin, evening primrose oil, Myrrhinil intest(R), plantago ovata, silymarin, sophora, tormentil, wheatgrass-juice and wormwood; 1 RCT for trichuris suis ovata; 7 RCT for mind/body interventions such as lifestyle modification, hypnotherapy, relaxation training and mindfulness; and 2 RCT in acupuncture; were found. Risk of bias was quite heterogeneous. Best evidence was found for herbal therapy, ie plantago ovata and curcumin in UC maintenance therapy, wormwood in CD, mind/body therapy and self-intervention in UC, and acupuncture in UC and CD. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary and alternative therapies might be effective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases; however, given the low number of trials and the heterogeneous methodological quality of trials, further in-depth research is necessary.},

They were rare before the 1930's but the incidence has been increasing in both developed and developing countries. We have recently reported that the incidence in Nova Scotia, the area with one of the highest reported burden globally, is decreasing since 1997. We postulate that this decrease may be due to the addition of folate to cereals. This was mandated in 1998 but the process of fortification began in 1997. There is circumstantial evidence from epidemiology studies that a diet deficient in folate may have contributed to the global rise in these diseases. This hypothesis, if proven to be correct, has important implications for the prevention and treatment of these diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a debilitating chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Appropriate use of diet and nutritional therapy is integral to the overall management strategy of Crohn's disease. The aim was to develop evidence-based guidelines on the dietary management of Crohn's disease in adults. METHODS: Questions relating to the dietary management of Crohn's disease were developed. These included the roles of enteral nutrition to induce remission, food re-introduction diets to structure food re-introduction and maintain remission, and dietary management of stricturing disease, as well as whether probiotics or prebiotics induce or maintain remission. A comprehensive literature search was conducted and relevant studies from January 1985 to November 2009 were identified using the electronic database search engines CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science. Evidence statements, recommendations, practical considerations and research recommendations were developed. RESULTS: Fifteen research papers were critically appraised and the evidence formed the basis of these guidelines. Although corticosteroids appear to be more effective, enteral nutrition (elemental or non-elemental) can be offered as an alternative option to induce disease remission. After a course of enteral nutrition, food re-introduction diets may be useful to structure food re-introduction and help maintain disease remission. Dietary fibre is contraindicated in the presence of strictures as a result of the risk of mechanical obstruction. The use of probiotics and prebiotics is not currently supported. CONCLUSIONS: As an alternative to corticosteroids, evidence supports enteral nutrition to induce disease remission. Food re-introduction diets provide structure to food re-introduction and help maintain disease remission. These guidelines aim to reduce variation in clinical practice.},

Recent evidence suggests that CD may involve genetic or environmental factors that impair the normal innate immune system's ability to contain bacteria to the lumen. Multiple dietary components may impact on the resident flora, diminish or damage the mucous layer, increase intestinal permeability or increase the ability of pathobionts to adhere to epithelial cells or translocate across the epithelial barrier. This chapter reviews the possible effects of different dietary components present in the Western diet to affect bacterial clearance mechanisms, and offers a hypothetical model for an acquired bacterial clearance defect in CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The anti-inflammatory effects of n-3 (omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil) have been suggested to be beneficial in chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the efficacy and safety of n-3 for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (CD). SEARCH METHODS: The following databases were searched from inception to November 2013 without language restriction: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, HealthSTAR, PubMed, and ACP journal club. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) of n-3 for maintenance of remission in CD were included. Studies must have enrolled patients of any age group, who were in remission at the time of recruitment, and were followed for at least six months. The intervention must have been fish oil or n-3 given in pre-defined dosage. Co-interventions were allowed only if they were balanced between the study groups. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome was the relapse rate and secondary outcomes included change in disease activity scores, time to first relapse and adverse events. Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary and selected secondary outcomes was reassessed for the current update using the GRADE system. We used the RevMan software for analyses. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the hazard ratio and 95% CI for time-to-event outcomes. Random-effects or fixed-effect models were used according to degree of heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses were performed in an attempt to explore possible sources of heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: Six studies with a total of 1039 patients were eligible for inclusion. The two largest studies were rated as low risk of bias for all assessed items. Four studies were rated as unclear risk of bias for randomization and allocation concealment. Two studies were rated as high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. There was a marginal significant benefit of n-3 therapy for maintenance of remission. Thirty-nine per cent of patients in the n-3 group relapsed at 12 months compared to 47% of placebo patients (6 studies, 1039 patients; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98). A GRADE analysis rated the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. relapse) as very low due to unexplained heterogeneity (I2 = 58%), publication bias, and a high or unknown risk of bias in four studies in the pooled analysis. When two large studies at low risk of bias were considered the benefit was no longer statistically significant. Thirty-seven per cent of patients in the n-3 group relapsed at 12 months compared to 42% of placebo patients (2 studies, 738 patients; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05). No significant heterogeneity was identified for this pooled analysis ( I2 = 0%). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (294 events). No serious adverse events were recorded in any of the studies but in a pooled analyses there was a significantly higher rate of diarrhea (4 studies, 862 patients; RR 1.36 95% CI 1.01 to 1.84) and upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms (5 studies, 999 patients; RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.18) in the n-3 treatment group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from two large high quality studies suggests that omega 3 fatty acids are probably ineffective for maintenance of remission in CD. Omega 3 fatty acids appear to be safe although they may cause diarrhea and upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic debilitating diseases that occur in populations around the world. The underlying etiology is thought to be multifactorial. There is a well-defined genetic contribution to the diseases, but this does not fully explain the epidemiology. Environmental factors, including the composition of the gut microbiota, are also important. There is wide geographic variability in the incidence and prevalence of IBD. High incidence rates have been observed in the United Kingdom, Northern Europe, Canada, and the United States. Globally, there is evidence of increasing incidence of CD and UC over time. The rising incidence of IBD in Western countries has generally predated that in developing nations, supporting the hypothesis that 'Westernization' of our lifestyle has led to the increased incidence of IBD. Smoking, antibiotic use, and diet are potentially reversible risk factors for IBD. Recommendations to avoid smoking are appropriate for all people, for numerous reasons. Antibiotic use should be limited to appropriate indications, a recommendation that too is appropriate for all populations. Detangling the relationship between diet, the gut microbiome and IBD raises the potential to reduce the incidence of IBD through dietary modification, an approach that might be considered among those at the highest risk.},

As neither medical nor surgical therapy provides a cure for Crohn's disease, the primary goals of therapy are to induce and maintain remission and prevent complications. As a biologic agent, infliximab, a monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor, is indicated for refractory luminal and fistulizing Crohn's disease that does not respond to other medical therapies or surgery. Infliximab has proven to be very effective for inducing and maintaining remission in Crohn's disease; however, infliximab treatment has several potential complications. Here, we report a case of free perforation following a therapeutic response after an initial dose of infliximab for Crohn's disease. This is the first case report describing a free perforation in a Crohn's disease patient after an initial dose of infliximab.},

IBD has been reported an increased prevalence of low bone mass. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the nutritional status and to investigate the correlation between bone mineral density (BMD) and nutrient factors in patients with IBD. METHODS: A total of 41 subjects were classified into normal group (n=21) and malnourished group (n=20) by the subjective global assessment result. We surveyed the dietary habit, nutrient intake, and BMD. RESULTS: Subjects' average age was 36.7 years old, and included 26 ulcerative colitis and 15 Crohn's disease. The serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher and serum calcium was significantly lower in the malnourished group. Lower bone density subjects were more in the malnourished group but no significant difference. Intake of energy, protein, carbohydrate, fiber, iron, sodium, potassium, zinc, vitamin B6, vitamin C and folate were significantly lower in the malnourished group. The BMD of malnourished group showed correlation with triceps skin fold thickness (TSF), CRP, dietary calcium, phosphorous, iron, animal iron, zinc and vitamin. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that adequate intake of nutrients is important to prevent bone loss and systemic education programs are need for IBD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is increasing. Although CAM often improves patients' well-being, it can also lead to side-effects and interactions with conventional medications. Research on patients with IBD in Sweden who have experiences of CAM is sparse. More studies are needed to enhance awareness of and improve communication about CAM. The aim of this study was to describe experiences of CAM in the healthcare context reported by patients with IBD. METHODS: Fifteen patients with IBD, eight with Crohn's disease (CD) and seven with ulcerative colitis (UC), were recruited. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted and qualitative content analysis was performed. RESULTS: The analysis revealed the theme Knowledge and communication lead to participation in the area of CAM based on three categories; CAM use, Communication and Self-care. Patients with IBD wanted to be asked about CAM to be able to start a dialogue, as some perceived being treated in a disparaging manner and not taken seriously when raising the subject. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) need to be aware of this in order to meet and understand patient needs. Patients with IBD found it easier to communicate about CAM with the IBD nurses than physicians and dietary changes was one important CAM treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that it was easier to discuss CAM with nurses than physicians emphasizes the important role of the IBD nurse in communication and monitoring patients' CAM use. Patients wanted to be asked about CAM to be able to start a dialogue, as some perceived not taken seriously when raising the subject. Furthermore, HCPs need to understand that many patients with IBD regard dietary changes as an important part of CAM treatment. Further research in these areas is needed.},

National audits have reported that dietetic resourcing in gastroenterology is inadequate. The present study aimed to identify current practice in the nutritional assessment and dietary management of enteral nutrition in CD, as well as investigate the factors that influenced it. METHODS: A nationwide questionnaire survey adopting complete population sampling of all 296 U.K. acute hospitals was undertaken aiming to determine dietetic resourcing for gastroenterology. In addition, the case-note review method was used to investigate approaches to nutritional assessment and dietary management of enteral nutrition as treatment for active CD. RESULTS: Data were returned from 149 (56%) hospitals, providing assessment and management information on 190 patients. The median number of dietetic sessions dedicated to gastroenterology was 2 per week (interquartile range 4). Hospitals with five or more sessions per week dedicated to gastroenterology used a greater number of components in their nutritional assessment [mean (SD) 21.5 ( 5.0)] than those with fewer sessions [mean (SD) 19.6 (SD) 6.1, P = 0.05]. Enteral nutrition was perceived to be effective in 100 (55%) of 182 patients. The major reasons for limited success were poor compliance and inadequate volumes consumed, as well as insufficient treatment duration. CONCLUSIONS: The components included in a nutritional assessment of CD patients are significantly lower in hospitals with fewer dietetic gastroenterology sessions. Focus on improving compliance and duration of enteral nutrition is urgently required to maximise the success of enteral nutrition in the treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The laparoscopic approach is becoming the gold standard in the surgical treatment of primary Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to compare laparoscopic-assisted and open ileocolic resection for primary Crohn's disease. METHODS: We conducted a non-randomized, comparative, retrospective analysis of a prospective database from 1998 to 2010. The remaining 129 patients were divided into two groups: laparoscopic-assisted group (Group L; n=64) and conventional group (Group C; n=65). There were no differences between the two groups as regards preoperative patient characteristics. Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen (90.7%) patients had no complications. Out of 12 patients (9.3%) with complications, four (3.1%) had Grade I, six (4.7%) had Grade II and two (1.6%) had Grade III. There were no postoperative deaths (Grade V). Operating time was longer in Group L compared with Group C (P<0.001). Bowel function returned more quickly in the laparoscopic group in terms of return of bowel movements (P=0.018) and resumption of a regular diet (P=0.06). The mean length of stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (P=0.001). The mean follow-up was 26 months in Group L versus 34 months in Group C (P=0.06). During follow-up, six patients presented with small bowel obstruction in Group C, which was not statistically different from Group L (3 patients) (P=0.25). During the follow-up period, there have been no recurrences of Crohn's disease in the laparoscopic group while 11 patients (16.9%) have developed a recurrence in the conventional group (P=0.001). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolectomy for primary Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum and/or cecum is safe and successful in most cases. Laparoscopic surgery for Crohn's disease should be considered as the preferred operative approach for primary resections.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation of organic and functional intestinal disorders can overlap and clinicians often rely on invasive and time-consuming procedures to make a final diagnosis. Regenerating islet-derived 3-alpha (Reg3alpha) is detectable in the circulation of patients with intestinal graft-versus host disease and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). AIM: To determine whether serum Reg3alpha testing is useful for discriminating mucosal enteropathies from functional intestinal disorders. METHODS: We prospectively included 47 patients with active coeliac disease (ACD), 13 patients with refractory coeliac disease (RCD), seven patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), 72 patients with active Crohn's disease, 22 patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) and 28 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-related diarrhoea. Sera were also taken from 10 CD patients before and after 6-12 months of a gluten-free diet (GFD) and from 14 patients with IBD before and after induction therapy with Infliximab (IFX). Sera of 119 healthy volunteers were used to determine the cut-off value. Reg3alpha levels were measured by a commercial ELISA kit. RESULTS: Levels of Reg3alpha exceeded the cut-off value of the assay in 43/47(91%) ACD patients, 13/13(100%) RCD patients, 7/7(100%) CVID patients, 65/72(90%) Crohn's disease patients, 17/22(77%) UC patients and one patient with IBS(4%). Reg3alpha levels distinguished mucosal enteropathies from IBS with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 96%. Reg3alpha levels significantly decreased in CD patients following a GFD and in IBD patients after treatment with IFX. CONCLUSION: Reg3alpha is a serum biomarker of intestinal damage that, combined with clinical data, identifies patients who should undergo invasive tests for diagnosing enteropathies.},

   abstract = {During nutrient deprivation, autophagy provides the constituents required to maintain the metabolism essential for survival. Recently, genome-wide association studies have identified genetic determinants for susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD) such as ATG16L1 and IRGM that are involved in the autophagy pathway. Both disease-carrying NOD2 mutations and ATG16L1 mutations may result in impairment of autophagy. Impairment in autophagy results in impaired clearance of microbes. Ileal CD is associated with Paneth cell loss of function such as decreased production of alpha-defensins, which may arise from mutations in NOD2 or autophagy genes. Nutrients are able to modify several cellular pathways and in particular autophagy. We summarize the contribution of a variety of dietary components to activate autophagy. Understanding the crosstalk between nutrients and autophagy in the intestine may provide novel targets that have therapeutics potential in intestinal inflammation. Nutrient activation of autophagy may contribute to restoring the Paneth cell loss of function in ileal CD.},

We aimed to review the potential mechanisms behind the antiinflammatory effects of unsaturated fatty acids on intestinal inflammation, to discuss their potential limitations, and to propose a new reappraisal of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A literature search using PubMed was carried out to identify relevant studies (basic science, epidemiological studies, or clinical trials) with unsaturated fatty acids and IBD. Only articles published in English were included. IBD patients exhibit an altered lipid metabolism. While in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the antiinflammatory properties of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in experimental models IBD, results of clinical trials have been disappointing. In addition, the impact of fatty acid on innate immunity as an alternative therapeutic approach is explored. This may offer insight into therapeutic avenues for designing n-3 PUFA diet therapy for IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammation is an essential immune response; however, chronic inflammation results in disease including Crohn's disease. Therefore, reducing the inflammation can yield a significant health benefit, and one way to achieve this is through diet. We developed a Mediterranean-inspired anti-inflammatory diet and used this diet in a 6-week intervention in a Crohn's disease population. We examined changes in inflammation and also in the gut microbiota. We compared the results of established biomarkers, C-reactive protein and the micronuclei assay, of inflammation with results from a transcriptomic approach. RESULTS: Data showed that being on our diet for 6 weeks was able to reduce the established biomarkers of inflammation. However, using transcriptomics, we observed significant changes in gene expression. Although no single gene stood out, the cumulative effect of small changes in many genes combined to have a beneficial effect. Data also showed that our diet resulted in a trend of normalising the microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that our Mediterranean-inspired diet appeared to benefit the health of people with Crohn's disease. Our participants showed a trend for reduced markers of inflammation and normalising of the microbiota. The significant changes in gene expression after 6 weeks highlighted the increased sensitivity of using transcriptomics when compared to the established biomarkers and open up a new era of dietary intervention studies.},

A mutated and dysregulated form of JAK2, a tyrosine kinase, is associated with several diseases including Crohn's disease. Using an in vitro, time-resolved fluorescence (TR-FRET) assay, we tested 49 different types of food extracts, plus 10 concentrated fractions of increasing hydrophobicity from each extract, to find foods containing JAK2 inhibitors. The food extracts tested included grains, meat, fish, shellfish, dairy products, herbs, mushrooms, hops, fruits and vegetables. Several fruits were potent inhibitors of JAK2: blackberry, boysenberry, feijoa, pomegranate, rosehip and strawberry, which all contain ellagitannins, known inhibitors of kinases. These fruits are in the Rosales and Myrtales plant orders. No other foods gave >1% of the maximal JAK2 inhibitory activities of these fruits. AMPK, a sensor and regulator of energy metabolism in cells, is a serine-threonine kinase which is reported to be activated by various flavonoid phytochemicals. Using a TR-FRET assay, we tested various fruit extracts for AMPK activation and inhibition. Ellagitannin containing foods scored highly as AMPK inhibitors. Despite several reports of AMPK activation in whole cells by phytochemicals, no extracts or pure compounds activated AMPK in our assay.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Research has been carried out in various countries into the nutritional adequacy of the GFD in terms of macro- and micronutrients, mostly presenting conflicting results. However, no data for Germany are available to date. AIM: To elucidate the nutritional composition of a GFD and to compare it with non-GFD in a representative German non-CD population. METHODS AND PATIENTS: A total of 1,000 patients who were members of the German Celiac Society (DZG) were invited to fill out a prospective 7-day food diary and a questionnaire. Data from 88 patients aged 14-80 years were analyzed and compared to the DACH reference values and to data from the German National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NVS II). RESULTS: No significant difference was observed for the intake of energy and macronutrients in male celiac patients compared to the NVS II. Only the fiber intake of male patients was significantly lower than that of the general population. Female patients, however, showed a significantly higher fat intake, but lower carbohydrate consumption. The average daily micronutrient intake of male and female patients, specifically of vitamin B1, B2, B6, folic acid, magnesium and iron, was significantly lower in celiac patients compared to the NVS II. CONCLUSION: This study reveals inadequate nutrient intake by male and female celiac patients in Germany. Based on our findings, regular (laboratory) monitoring of celiac patients should be recommended.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The causes of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are largely unknown. This paper reviews the epidemiological and clinical data on how medications (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogens and antibiotics), lifestyle factors (smoking, psychological stress, diet and air pollution) may precipitate clinical relapses and recurrence. Potential biological mechanisms include: increasing thrombotic tendency, imbalances in prostaglandin synthesis, alterations in the composition of gut microbiota, and mucosal damage causing increased permeability. RESULTS: The clinical epidemiological data consistently reports positive associations between smoking and relapses in CD, and inverse ones with UC. For NSAIDs and estrogens, the epidemiological findings are inconsistent, although general antibiotic use was associated with a reduced risk of relapse in CD. High levels of stress were positively associated with relapse, although psychological interventions did not have therapeutic benefits. The limited work on diet has reported sulphur-containing foods are positively associated with relapse in UC, but there is no work in CD. Ecological data reported positive correlations between air pollution levels and IBD hospitalisations. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, to clarify this area, more clinical epidemiological work is required where detailed drug types and doses, and complete dietary intakes are measured, in specific forms of IBD. Such work could provide guidance to both patients and doctors to help maintain remission.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Western diet is a risk factor for Crohn's disease (CD). Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6) is abnormally expressed in CD patients. This allows adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) to colonise the gut mucosa and leads to inflammation. We assessed the effects of a high fat/high sugar (HF/HS) Western diet on gut microbiota composition, barrier integrity and susceptibility to infection in transgenic CEABAC10 mice expressing human CEACAMs. DESIGN: Colonic microbiota composition and susceptibility of CEABAC10 mice to AIEC LF82 bacteria infection were determined in mice fed a conventional or HF/HS diet. Barrier function and inflammatory response were assessed by studying intestinal permeability, tight junction protein and mucin expression and localisation, and by determining histological score and levels of cytokine release. RESULTS: HF/HS diet led to dysbiosis in WT and transgenic CEABAC10 mice, with a particular increase in E coli population in HF/HS-fed CEABAC10 mice. These mice showed decreased mucus layer thickness, increased intestinal permeability, induction of Nod2 and Tlr5 gene transcription, and increased TNFalpha secretion. These modifications led to a higher ability of AIEC bacteria to colonise the gut mucosa and to induce inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Western diet induces changes in gut microbiota composition, alters host homeostasis and promotes AIEC gut colonisation in genetically susceptible mice. These results support the multifactorial aetiology of CD and highlight the importance of diet in CD pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {Escherichia coli (E. coli), and particularly the adherent invasive E. coli (AIEC) pathotype, has been increasingly implicated in the ethiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). E. coli strains with similar pathogenic features to AIEC have been associated with other intestinal disorders such as ulcerative colitis, colorectal cancer, and coeliac disease, but AIEC prevalence in these diseases remains largely unexplored. Since AIEC was described one decade ago, substantial progress has been made in deciphering its mechanisms of pathogenicity. However, the molecular bases that characterize the phenotypic properties of this pathotype are still not well resolved. A review of studies focused on E. coli populations in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is presented here and we discuss about the putative role of this species on each IBD subtype. Given the relevance of AIEC in CD pathogenesis, we present the latest research findings concerning AIEC host-microbe interactions and pathogenicity. We also review the existing data regarding the prevalence and abundance of AIEC in CD and its association with other intestinal diseases from humans and animals, in order to discuss the AIEC disease- and host-specificity. Finally, we highlight the fact that dietary components frequently found in industrialized countries may enhance AIEC colonization in the gut, which merits further investigation and the implementation of preventative measures.},

We reviewed the literature to highlight the importance of proper nutrition management. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed for English-language publications from 1999 through 2012. Manuscripts comparing nutritional approaches for IBD patients were selected. RESULTS: We identified 2025 manuscripts: six meta-analyses, 170 clinical-trials, 692 reviews. The study findings are discordant. In adult CD, enteral nutrition plays a supportive role, steroid therapy remaining the first choice treatment. In CD children enteral nutrition may represent the primary therapy. As regards parenteral nutrition, there are no large randomized studies, although mild improvements in morbidity have been described as a result of parenteral nutrition in malnourished surgical IBD patients. Specific micronutrient deficiencies are common in IBD. A number of factors may contribute to micronutrient deficiencies, and these include: dietary restriction, disease activity and surgery. The possible therapeutic roles of omega-3 fatty-acids, probiotics and prebiotics have been studied, but the results are still preliminary. CONCLUSION: Protein-energy malnutrition and micronutrient depletion are clinical concerns in IBD patients. Enteral nutrition, parenteral nutrition and micronutrient supplementation are cornerstone of the multidisciplinary management of IBD patients.},

A set of clinical practice guidelines for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease were thus published in 2006 and 2011, respectively. Their English versions were then published in 2000 and 2012, respectively. These guidelines aim to provide appropriate clinical indicators to Japanese practitioners to improve the outcomes of inflammatory bowel disease patients. The guidelines are based on global literature-based evidence as well as evidence from Japan. The Japanese guidelines were developed based on the existing evidence with integration of the experts' consensus. The criteria for recommendation grade were also determined by the level of evidence as well as by the experts' consensus. It is a distinct feature of the Japanese guidelines to disclose this process explicitly. This recommendation rating is thus useful to fill the gap between evidence and daily clinical practice. Since the Japanese guidelines are primarily based on global literature-based evidence, most of the clinical indicators in them are consistent with those in other guidelines from the Western world. Meanwhile, there are some distinctly different statements in the Japanese guidelines reflecting Japanese standard clinical practice, evidence, and the opinions of Japanese experts.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment resistant chronic pouchitis causes significant morbidity. Elemental diet is effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Since pouchitis shares some similarities to Crohn's disease we hypothesised that elemental diet may be an effective treatment. METHOD: Seven pouchitis patients (with ulcerative colitis) were studied. All had active pouchitis with a pouch disease activity index (PDAI) >/=7. Exclusion criteria were recent NSAIDs, antibiotics or probiotics. Sufficient elemental diet to achieve energy requirements was provided. Flexible-pouchoscopy was performed, and the Cleveland Global Quality of Life score (CGQoL), Pouch Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and BMI were recorded at baseline and following 28 days of elemental diet. Faecal samples were also collected at these time points and analysed for major bacterial groups using culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Data were analysed using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. RESULTS: Following 28 days of exclusive elemental diet, median stool frequency decreased from 12 to 6 per day (p=0.028), median clinical PDAI decreased from 4 to 1 (p=0.039). There was no significant difference in quality of life scores or PDAI before and following treatment. There was a trend towards an increase in the concentration of Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale (median 7.9 to 8.5 log(1)(0)/g, p=0.08) following exclusive elemental diet. CONCLUSION: Treatment with four weeks elemental diet appeared to improve the symptoms of chronic pouchitis in some patients but is not an effective strategy for inducing remission. Although a potential symptom modifier, elemental diet cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of active pouchitis.},

UC is limited to the colon, while CD may involve any portion of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. These diseases exhibit a pattern of relapse and remission, and the disease processes are often painful and debilitating. Due to the chronic nature of IBD and the negative side effects of many of the conventional therapies, many patients and their families turn to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for symptom relief. This article focuses on the current available evidence behind CAM/integrative therapies for IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), including Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, have long been associated with a genetic basis, and more recently host immune responses to microbial and environmental agents. Dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis allows one to study the pathogenesis of IBD associated environmental triggers such as stress and diet, the effects of potential therapies, and the mechanisms underlying intestinal inflammation and mucosal injury. In this paper, we investigated the effects of dietary n-3 and n-6 fatty acids on the colonic mucosal inflammatory response to DNBS-induced colitis in rats. All rats were fed identical diets with the exception of different types of fatty acids [safflower oil (SO), canola oil (CO), or fish oil (FO)] for three weeks prior to exposure to intrarectal DNBS. Control rats given intrarectal ethanol continued gaining weight over the 5 day study, whereas, DNBS-treated rats fed lipid diets all lost weight with FO and CO fed rats demonstrating significant weight loss by 48 hr and rats fed SO by 72 hr. Weight gain resumed after 72 hr post DNBS, and by 5 days post DNBS, the FO group had a higher body weight than SO or CO groups. Colonic sections collected 5 days post DNBS-treatment showed focal ulceration, crypt destruction, goblet cell depletion, and mucosal infiltration of both acute and chronic inflammatory cells that differed in severity among diet groups. The SO fed group showed the most severe damage followed by the CO, and FO fed groups that showed the mildest degree of tissue injury. Similarly, colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, a marker of neutrophil activity was significantly higher in SO followed by CO fed rats, with FO fed rats having significantly lower MPO activity. These results demonstrate the use of DNBS-induced colitis, as outlined in this protocol, to determine the impact of diet in the pathogenesis of IBD.},

   abstract = {The physiology and pathology of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are closely related. This similarity between the two organs may underlie why dysfunction in one organ may induce illness in the other. For example, smoking is a major risk factor for COPD and IBD and increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease. Probiotics have been defined as "live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefits on the host." In model systems probiotics regulate innate and inflammatory immune responses. Commonly used probiotics include lactic acid bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Saccharomyces, and these are often used as dietary supplements to provide a health benefit in gastrointestinal diseases including infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer. In this respect, probiotics probably act as immunomodulatory agents and activators of host defence pathways which suggest that they could influence disease severity and incidence at sites distal to the gut. There is increasing evidence that orally delivered probiotics are able to regulate immune responses in the respiratory system. This review provides an overview of the possible role of probiotics and their mechanisms of action in the prevention and treatment of respiratory diseases.},

   abstract = {Decreased consumption of dietary fibers, such as cellulose, has been proposed to promote the emergence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]) where intestinal microbes are recognized to play an etiologic role. However, it is not known if transient fiber consumption during critical developmental periods may prevent consecutive intestinal inflammation. The incidence of IBD peaks in young adulthood indicating that pediatric environmental exposures may be important in the etiology of this disease group. We studied the effects of transient dietary cellulose supplementation on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis susceptibility during the pediatric period in mice. Cellulose supplementation stimulated substantial shifts in the colonic mucosal microbiome. Several bacterial taxa decreased in relative abundance (e.g., Coriobacteriaceae [p = 0.001]), and other taxa increased in abundance (e.g., Peptostreptococcaceae [p = 0.008] and Clostridiaceae [p = 0.048]). Some of these shifts persisted for 10 days following the cessation of cellulose supplementation. The changes in the gut microbiome were associated with transient trophic and anticolitic effects 10 days following the cessation of a cellulose-enriched diet, but these changes diminished by 40 days following reversal to a low cellulose diet. These findings emphasize the transient protective effect of dietary cellulose in the mammalian large bowel and highlight the potential role of dietary fibers in amelioration of intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Multiple characteristics of industrialization have been proposed to contribute to the global emergence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs: Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis). Major changes in eating habits during the last decades and the effectiveness of exclusive enteral nutrition in the treatment of Crohn disease indicate the etiologic importance of dietary intake in IBDs. A uniform characteristic of nutrition in developing countries (where the incidence of IBD is low) and exclusive enteral nutrition is their consistent nature for prolonged periods; however, the potentially beneficial effect of dietary monotony in respect to mammalian intestinal inflammation has not been examined. METHODS: The association between alternating (2 different complete chows) and persistent regular diets, and dextran sulfate sodium colitis susceptibility in C57BL/6J mice was studied. Colonic mucosal microbiota changes were investigated by high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. RESULTS: The severity of colitis increased upon dietary alternation compared with consistent control feeding. The microbiota of the alternating nutritional group clustered discretely from both control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that monotonous dietary intake may decrease mammalian vulnerability against colitis in association with microbiota separation. The epidemiologic and therapeutic implications of our results are also discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) caused by a combination of genetic, clinical, and environmental factors. Identification of CD patients at high risk of requiring surgery may assist clinicians to decide on a top-down or step-up treatment approach. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control analysis of a population-based cohort of 503 CD patients. A regression-based data reduction approach was used to systematically analyse 63 genomic, clinical and environmental factors for association with IBD-related surgery as the primary outcome variable. RESULTS: A multi-factor model was identified that yielded the highest predictive accuracy for need for surgery. The factors included in the model were the NOD2 genotype (OR = 1.607, P = 2.3 x 10(-5)), having ever had perianal disease (OR = 2.847, P = 4 x 10(-6)), being post-diagnosis smokers (OR = 6.312, P = 7.4 x 10(-3)), being an ex-smoker at diagnosis (OR = 2.405, P = 1.1 x 10(-3)) and age (OR = 1.012, P = 4.4 x 10(-3)). Diagnostic testing for this multi-factor model produced an area under the curve of 0.681 (P = 1 x 10(-4)) and an odds ratio of 3.169, (95% CI P = 1 x 10(-4)) which was higher than any factor considered independently. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study require validation in other populations but represent a step forward in the development of more accurate prognostic tests for clinicians to prescribe the most optimal treatment approach for complicated CD patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is one of the therapeutic strategies used to induce remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Although its use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines and consensus documents, the frequency of this practice in Spain is unknown. METHODS: A 70-item questionnaire ( PRESENT: PREScription of Enteral Nutrition in pediaTric Crohn's disease in Spain) was drafted and distributed through the SEGHNP (Spanish Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) e-mail list. RESULTS: We received information from 51 Pediatric Gastroenterology Units. Of the 287 patients newly diagnosed with CD in 2011-2012 at these centres (139 in 2011, 148 in 2012), 182 (63%) received EEN (58% in 2011 and 68% in 2012). 26% of the patients who received EEN in the period studied (64/246) did so during relapses. All the physicians (100%) who responded to the questionnaire believe that EEN is effective in inducing clinical remission in mild to moderate CD. However, 24.5% of respondents never use EEN during relapses. The enteral formulas used most often used were polymeric formulas specific for CD (70.6%) and the preferred administration route was oral, with 60.8% using flavouring and 9.3% allowing a variable percentage of calories in the form of other foods. 65% use 5-ASA together with EEN, 69% use antibiotics and 95% immunomodulators (thiopurines). The duration of EEN tends to be 8 weeks (47.1%), and transition to regular diet was achieved sequentially over a variable period of time. Regarding barriers and limiting factors for the use of EEN, those most frequently reported include lack of acceptance by the patient and/or family (71%), lack of time and/or ancillary staff (69%) and difficulty in convincing the patient and/or family of the suitability of treatment (43%). CONCLUSIONS: EEN use rates are similar to those of other European questionnaires. Tools that facilitate acceptance by the patient and family are needed. Increasing the time dedicated to this therapeutic modality is likewise important. Given the disparity of criteria for indicating treatment with EEN, it would be useful to have widely accepted clinical practice guidelines or protocols that facilitate the decision to use it.},

Incidence and prevalence may have stabilized in high-incidence areas such as North America and Europe but they continue to rise in previously low-incidence areas such as Eastern Europe, Asia, and much of the developing world. This epidemiological shift likely relates to westernization of lifestyle, changes in diet, and improved hygiene as part of socioeconomic development in developing countries. In Asia, UC is more prevalent than CD, although the UC:CD ratio is narrowing in certain areas. Clinical manifestations of IBD in Asia resemble the Western population, but with some differences, including higher prevalence of males and ileo-colonic CD, less familial clustering, lower surgical rates and extra-intestinal manifestations. These differences may relate to time, genetics and environmental factors. Studying the epidemiology of IBD in an area of rapidly increasing incidence may lead to discovery of important etiologic factors associated with disease development.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The rising incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Asia supports the importance of environmental risk factors in disease aetiology. This prospective population-based case-control study in Asia-Pacific examined risk factors prior to patients developing IBD. DESIGN: 442 incident cases (186 Crohn's disease (CD); 256 UC; 374 Asians) diagnosed between 2011 and 2013 from eight countries in Asia and Australia and 940 controls (frequency-matched by sex, age and geographical location; 789 Asians) completed an environmental factor questionnaire at diagnosis. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted ORs (aOR) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: In multivariate model, being breast fed >12 months (aOR 0.10; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.30), antibiotic use (aOR 0.19; 0.07 to 0.52), having dogs (aOR 0.54; 0.35 to 0.83), daily tea consumption (aOR 0.62; 0.43 to 0.91) and daily physical activity (aOR 0.58; 0.35 to 0.96) decreased the odds for CD in Asians. In UC, being breast fed >12 months (aOR 0.16; 0.08 to 0.31), antibiotic use (aOR 0.48; 0.27 to 0.87), daily tea (aOR 0.63; 0.46 to 0.86) or coffee consumption (aOR 0.51; 0.36 to 0.72), presence of hot water tap (aOR 0.65; 0.46 to 0.91) and flush toilet in childhood (aOR 0.71; 0.51 to 0.98) were protective for UC development whereas ex-smoking (aOR 2.02; 1.22 to 3.35) increased the risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: This first population-based study of IBD risk factors in Asia-Pacific supports the importance of childhood immunological, hygiene and dietary factors in the development of IBD, suggesting that markers of altered intestinal microbiota may modulate risk of IBD later in life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of complementary alternative medicine (CAM) is potentially prevalent among paediatric patients with chronic diseases but with variable rates among different age groups, diseases and countries. There are no recent reports on CAM use among paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in Europe. We hypothesized that CAM use associates with a more severe disease in paediatric IBD and JIA. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire study among adolescent outpatients with IBD and JIA addressing the frequency and type of CAM use during the past year. The patients were recruited at the Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, Finland. RESULTS: Of the 147 respondents, 97 had IBD (Crohn's disease: n = 46; median age 15.5, disease duration 3.4 years) and 50 had JIA (median age 13.8, disease duration 6.9 years). During the past 12 months, 48% regularly used CAM while 81% reported occasional CAM use. Compared to patients with JIA, the use of CAM in IBD patients tended to be more frequent. The most commonly used CAM included probiotics, multivitamins, and mineral and trace element supplements. Self-imposed dietary restrictions were common, involving 27.6% of the non-CAM users but 64.8% of all CAM users. Disease activity was associated with CAM use in JIA but not in IBD. CONCLUSIONS: CAM use is frequent among adolescents with IBD and JIA and associates with self-imposed dietary restrictions. Reassuringly, adherence to disease modifying drugs is good in young CAM users. In JIA, patients with active disease used more frequently CAM than patients with inactive disease. As CAM use is frequent, physicians should familiarise themselves with the basic concepts of CAM. The potential pharmacological interaction or the toxicity of certain CAM products warrants awareness and hence physicians should actively ask their patients about CAM use.},

   abstract = {Although epidemiological findings support a role for vitamin K status in the improvement of bone indices in adult patients with Crohn's disease (CD), this needs to be confirmed in double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCT) with phylloquinone (vitamin K1). By conducting two RCT, the present study aimed to first establish whether supplementation with 1000 mug of phylloquinone daily near-maximally suppresses the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin in serum (%ucOC; marker of vitamin K status) in adult patients with CD currently in remission as it does in healthy adults and second determine the effect of supplementation with phylloquinone at this dose for 12 months on the indices of bone turnover and bone mass. The initial dose-ranging RCT was conducted in adult patients with CD (n 10 per group) using 0 (placebo), 1000 or 2000 mug of phylloquinone daily for 2 weeks. In the main RCT, the effect of placebo v. 1000 mug vitamin K/d (both co-administered with Ca (500 mg/d) and vitamin D3 (10 mug/d)) for 12 months (n 43 per group) on the biochemical indices of bone turnover (determined by enzyme immunoassay) and bone mass (determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were investigated. At baseline, the mean %ucOC was 47 %, and this was suppressed upon supplementation with 1000 mug of phylloquinone daily ( - 81 %; P< 0.01) and not suppressed further by 2000 mug of phylloquinone daily. Compared with the placebo, supplementation with 1000 mug of phylloquinone daily for 12 months had no significant effect (P>0.1) on bone turnover markers or on the bone mass of the lumbar spine or femur, but modestly increased (P< 0.05) the bone mass of the total radius. Despite near maximal suppression of serum %ucOC, supplementation with 1000 mug of phylloquinone daily (with Ca and vitamin D3) had no effect on the indices of bone health in adult CD patients with likely vitamin K insufficiency.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Small bowel cleansing by capsule endoscopy has never been addressed in children. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of five bowel preparation regimens on the mucosal visibility surface (as percentage of visualized surface area). Group A: a clear liquid diet for 12 h on the day before; Group B: high volume polyethylene glycol (50 mL/kg, up to 2Lt/die); Group C: low volume polyethylene glycol (25 mL/kg up to 1Lt/die); Group D: 20 mL (376 mg) of oral simethicone; Group E: 25 mL/kg (up to 1Lt/die) of polyethylene glycol solution plus 20 mL (376 mg) of oral simethicone. RESULTS: Overall, 198 patients (53% male, median age 13 years) were enrolled. Preparation regimen visualization scores were 14.1 +/- 4.2, 18.9 +/- 5.1, 17.8 +/- 5.5, 14.9 +/- 4.8 and 20.9 +/- 4.6 in groups A, B, C, D and E, respectively (P < 0.01). Positive findings were found in 172 cases (87%), but no significant differences were observed in the diagnostic yield and tolerability. Interobserver agreement, k = 0.89 (95% CI 0.83 +/- 0.71). CONCLUSION: This is the first report in children that supports the use of 25 mL/kg (up to 1Lt/die) of polyethylene glycol solution plus 20 mL (376 mg) of oral simethicone as the preparation of choice for capsule endoscopy.},

   abstract = {The Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) protein is a polytopic transmembrane protein responsible for dietary cholesterol absorption. Genetic variation in the NPC1L1 gene affects cholesterol absorption and serum cholesterol levels. However, NCP1L1 genotypes have not previously been invesigated. In this study, genotyping of the NPC1L1 gene was examined in healthy individuals as well as patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A total of 541 individuals were enrolled in the study, including 80 patients with HCV hepatitis, 205 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 127 with Crohn's disease (CD). Genotyping was performed using TaqMan(R) SNP assays. Minor allelic frequencies of the 17345C>G (rs2072183) and 19031G>A (rs4720470) SNPs were found to be 0.40 and 0.30, respectively. No significant differences were detected in serum HCV levels in the 1735C>G or 19031G>A SNPs. The 1735C>G SNPs were not associated with total cholesterol (TC) levels in the healthy controls and/or HCV patients. However, statistically significant associations between the 1735GG variant and TC levels were detected in CD patients, with 1735GG carriers having the highest TC levels compared to the 1735CC and 1735CG carriers (P=0.048). Similar trends were noted in UC patients, but did not reach statistical significance (P= 0.19). The 19031G>A SNPs were not associated with TC levels in the healthy controls or patients. This study showed the allelic and genotypic distribution of 1735C>G and 19031G>ASNPs of the NPC1L1 gene in a large number of subjects. The NPC1L1 1735GG variant may therefore be favorable for CD accompanied with malnutrition.},

The current understanding of these diseases suggests that ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) result from poorly defined interactions between genetic and environmental factors which culminate in the pathologic effects and clinical manifestations of these diseases. The genetic variant appears not sufficient itself to lead to the development of the clinical disease, but likely must combine with the environmental factors. The intestinal microbiome is pivotal to IBD development. A greater understanding of the contribution of these factors to dysbiosis is critical, and we aspire to restoring a healthy microbiome to treat flares and ideally prevent the development of IBD and its complications. This article aims to place the environmental influences in the context of their potential contribution to the development of the pathophysiology of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia seems to be a common phenomenon in both patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Many factors including deficiencies of cobalamin, folate and pyridoxine, smoking habits, alcohol and coffee intake, some medications and age may predispose subjects to hyperhomocysteinemia. The study aimed to evaluate homocysteine levels in an inflammatory bowel disease cohort as dependent of life style and disease activity. METHODS: 85 consecutive patients with inflammatory bowel disease (38 with Crohn's disease and 47 with ulcerative colitis) and 65 control subjects were included in the prospective study. The following parameters were analyzed: disease activity, duration of the disease, location of pathological changes, presence of complications, current medications, past surgical procedures, smoking history, concomitant diseases, biochemical parameters and plasma homocysteine levels. RESULTS: Mild hyperhomocysteinemia was found in 16 patients with Crohn's disease (42%), 19 patients with ulcerative colitis (40%) and 19 patients in the control group (29%) (p = 0.59). There was not any significant correlation between homocysteine level and disease activity. Only folic acid supplementation and gender affected homocysteine level. Folic acid intake led to reduction of homocysteine levels in all groups of patients (11.8 micromol/l vs. 8.33 miccromol/l, p = 0.0065 in Crohn's disease patients and 10.94 micromol/l vs. 7.78 micromol/l, p = 0.0069 in ulcerative colitis patients). CONCLUSION: Homocysteine level in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is mostly normal or slightly elevated. Disease activity does not have an impact on homocysteine level. Folic acid is the most important factor having an influence on homocysteine level in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data regarding the long-term outcomes of restorative proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis including pouch function and quality of life in the pediatric population are limited in pediatric patients. STUDY DESIGN: Indications for surgery, complications, long-term function, and quality of life were evaluated in pediatric patients undergoing ileal pouch anal anastomosis. Assessment of quality of life was performed using the Cleveland Global Quality of Life score. RESULTS: There were 433 patients with a mean age of 18.04 +/- 2.9 years. Final pathologic diagnoses were ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis (78.3%), familial adenomatous polyposis (15.7%), Crohn's disease (5.1%), and others (0.9%). There were 237 patients (54.7%) who underwent total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis; 196 (45.3%) underwent initial subtotal colectomy followed by completion proctectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis. Anastomosis was stapled in 352 patients (81.3%) and hand-sewn in 81 (18.7%) patients. Mean follow-up was 108.5 +/- 78.4 months. At the most recent follow-up, mean Cleveland Global Quality of Life score was 0.8 +/- 0.2 and numbers of daytime and night-time bowel movements were 5.3 +/- 3.1 and 1.6 +/- 1.3, respectively. The majority of the patients (86.8%) were fully continent or only complained of rare incontinence. Most patients had no seepage (day, 84.3%; night, 72.4%) and did not wear any pads (day, 89.3%; night, 84.3%). Most denied dietary (71.3%), social (84.8%), work (85.7%), or sexual restrictions (87.6%) at the time of last follow-up. There were 92.7% of patients who said they would undergo ileal pouch anal anastomosis again and 95.2% would recommend surgery to others. CONCLUSIONS: Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be performed in pediatric patients with acceptable morbidity and is associated with good long-term results in terms of gastrointestinal function, quality of life, and patient satisfaction.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Vitamin D promotes bone health and regulates the immune system, both important actions for pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The supplementation dose that would maintain optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25OHD >/= 32 ng/mL) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to compare two supplementation regimens' efficacy and safety in maintaining optimal 25OHD in children with IBD. DESIGN: This was a randomized, not blinded, controlled trial. SETTING: The trial was conducted in the Boston Children's Hospital Clinical and Translational Study Unit. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-three patients, aged 8-18 years with IBD and baseline 25OHD greater than 20 ng/mL were enrolled; 48 completed the study, and one withdrew for adverse events. INTERVENTION: Arm A received 400 IU of oral vitamin D2 daily (n = 32). Arm B received 1000 IU daily in the summer/fall and 2000 IU in the winter/spring (n = 31). MAIN OUTCOME: The main outcome was the probability of maintaining 25OHD of 32 ng/mL or greater in all trimonthly visits for 12 months. RESULTS: Three participants in arm A (9.4%) and three in arm B (9.7%) achieved the primary outcome (P = .97). The incidence of adverse events, all minor, did not differ. More participants in arm A developed C-reactive protein level of 1 mg/dL or greater (31% vs 10%, P = .04) and IL-6 greater than 3 pg/mL (54% vs 27%, P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral vitamin D2 doses up to 2000 IU were inadequate to maintain optimal 25OHD but were well tolerated. The finding of lower incidence of elevated inflammatory markers and cytokines among participants receiving higher vitamin D2 doses merits further study.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) causes chronic, disfiguring, granulomatous inflammation of the lips and oral mucosa. A proportion of cases have co-existing intestinal Crohn's disease (CD). The pathogenesis is unknown but has recently been linked to dietary sensitivity. Although allergy has been suggested as an aetiological factor in OFG there are few published data to support this link. In this study, we sought clinical evidence of allergy in a series of patients with OFG and compared this to a series of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) without oral involvement and to population control estimates. METHODS: Prevalence rates of allergy and oral allergy syndrome (OAS) were determined in 88 patients with OFG using questionnaires, skin prick tests, total and specific serum IgE levels. Allergy was also determined in 117 patients with IBD without evidence of oral involvement (79 with CD and 38 with ulcerative colitis (UC)). RESULTS: Prevalence rates of allergy in patients with OFG were significantly greater than general population estimates (82% versus 22% respectively p = <0.0005). Rates of allergy were also greater in those with CD (39%) and, interestingly, highest in those with OFG and concurrent CD (87%). Conversely, whist OAS was common in allergic OFG patients (35%) rates of OAS were significantly less in patients with concomitant CD (10% vs 44% with and without CD respectively p = 0.006). Amongst CD patients, allergy was associated with perianal disease (p = 0.042) but not with ileal, ileocolonic or colonic disease location. Allergy in UC (18%) was comparable to population estimates. CONCLUSION: We provide compelling clinical evidence for the association of allergy with OFG whether occurring alone or in association with CD. The presence of gut CD increases this association but, conversely, reduces the expression of OAS in those with atopy. Interestingly, there is no evidence of increased allergy in UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) arachidonic acid (AA, n-6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, n-3) are precursors of eicosanoids and other lipid mediators which have critical roles in inflammation. The mediators formed from the different PUFA have different potencies. We hypothesised that metabolic changes associated with colonic mucosal inflammation would modify the bioavailability of the eicosanoid precursors AA and EPA. METHODS: Colonic mucosa biopsies were obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis and from matched controls. Inflammation was graded endoscopically and histologically. Esterified and non-esterified fatty acids were determined within the biopsies using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. RESULTS: Biopsy samples were collected from 69 UC patients (54 providing both inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa) and 69 controls. Inflamed mucosa had higher AA (p<0.001) and lower EPA (p<0.010) contents and a higher AA:EPA ratio (p<0.001). Inflamed mucosa also had higher docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and lower linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-LNA) contents (all p<0.001), compared to non-inflamed and controls. There were significant correlations between severity of inflammation and contents of AA, DPA and DHA (positive correlations) and of LA, alpha-LNA and EPA (negative correlations). CONCLUSIONS: Higher AA, AA:EPA ratio, DPA and DHA and lower LA, alpha-LNA and EPA are seen in inflamed mucosa in UC and correlate with severity of inflammation. This suggests an alteration in fatty acid metabolism in the inflamed gut mucosa, which may offer novel targets for intervention and should be considered if nutritional strategies are used.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The association of celiac disease with colorectal neoplasia is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the risk of colorectal neoplasia among patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We carried out a multicenter, retrospective case-control study, within four community hospitals. Celiac disease patients with a complete colonoscopy were regarded as cases and those without celiac disease as controls. For each case, two controls matched for age, sex, indication for colonoscopy and colorectal cancer family history, were randomly selected. The main outcome evaluated was risk of colorectal polyps, adenomas, advanced neoplastic lesions and cancer. RESULTS: We identified 118 patients with celiac disease and 236 controls. The risk of polyps, adenomas and advanced neoplastic lesions was similar in both groups (OR 1.25, CI 0.71-2.18, p=0.40; OR 1.39, CI 0.73-2.63, p=0.31; and OR 1.00, CI 0.26-3.72, p=1.00, respectively). On multivariate analysis, age >75 years old, and first-grade CRC family history were associated with adenomas (OR 2.68 CI 1.03-6.98, OR 6.68 CI 1.03-47.98 respectively) and advanced neoplastic lesions (OR 15.03, CI 2.88-78.3; OR 6.46 CI 1.23-33.79, respectively). With respect to celiac disease characteristic, a low adherence to a gluten free diet was independently associated with the presence of adenomas (OR 6.78 CI 1.39-33.20 p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease was not associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasia. Nonadherence to a strict gluten free diet was associated with the presence of adenomas. Further studies addressing celiac disease characteristics are needed to confirm this observation.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a complex inherited disorder of unknown pathogenesis with environmental, genetic and microbial factors involved in the development of the disease. A remarkable feature of this disease in childhood is the effective response to exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) therapy and the need for complete exclusion of normal diet required for success (principle of exclusivity). EEN or dietary interventions might act through removal of dietary components, which affect microbial composition, decrease a proinflammatory response and promote restitution of the epithelial barrier, likewise allowing termination of this vicious disease-forming cycle before a critical threshold is reached. Multiple traditional and nontraditional dietary components may affect the microbiome, mucous layer, intestinal permeability, or adherence and translocation of pathobionts. We review the epidemiological data, as well as data from animal models and cell lines, and propose a model for pathogenesis we have termed the 'bacterial penetration cycle', whereby dietary components such as animal fat, high sugar intake and gliadin, and consumption of emulsifiers, maltodextrin as well as low-fiber diets may be able to cause a localized acquired bacterial clearance defect, leading to bacterial adhesion and penetration, and subsequently inflammation in the gut.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Oxidative stress is presumed to play an important role in Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis. Nevertheless, the evaluation of the intestinal antioxidant capacity through the analysis of glutathione peroxidase activity in CD remains to be determined. METHODS: 20 CD outpatients and 16 volunteers going through colonic cancer screening were enrolled. Colonoscopy with biopsies was performed in all individuals. Samples from inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa were taken when there was CD endoscopic activity. Spectrophotometric assays were performed to measure tissue glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, and total (GSHT) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione in all samples. Demographics and clinical characteristics were collected from clinical charts. RESULTS: Inflamed CD mucosa presented reduced GPx activity compared to non-inflamed CD mucosa (42.94mU/mg protein vs 79.62mU/mg protein, P<0.05) and control mucosa (42.94mU/mg protein vs 95.08mU/mg protein, P<0.001). GSHT concentration was reduced in inflamed mucosa when compared to non-inflamed CD mucosa (0.78mumol/g vs 1.98mumol/g, P<0.01) and the control group (0.78mumol/g vs 2.11mumol/g, P<0.001). A significant correlation was detected between GPx activity and GSSG (r=-0.599), disease duration (r=0.546), and thiopurine treatment (r=-0.480) in non-inflamed CD mucosa. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that reduced GPx activity is present in inflamed CD mucosa. In addition, endoscopic activity, disease duration and thiopurine therapy could be associated with mucosal decreased antioxidant activity.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are disorders of chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract marked by episodes of relapse and remission. Over the past several decades, advances have been made in understanding the epidemiology of IBD. The incidence and prevalence of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have been increasing worldwide across pediatric and adult populations. As IBD is thought to be related to a combination of individual genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, and alterations in the gut microbiome that stimulate an inflammatory response, understanding the potentially modifiable environmental risk factors associated with the development or the course of IBD could impact disease rates or management in the future. Current hypotheses as to the development of IBD are reviewed, as are a host of environmental cofactors that have been investigated as both protective and inciting factors for IBD onset. Such environmental factors include breast feeding, gastrointestinal infections, urban versus rural lifestyle, medication exposures, stress, smoking, and diet. The role of these factors in disease course is also reviewed. Looking forward, there is still much to be learned about the etiology of IBD and how specific environmental exposures intimately impact the development of disease and also the potential for relapse.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota is central to health and disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. Differences in microbiota related to geography and ethnicity may hold the key to recent changes in the incidence of microbiota-related disorders. METHODS: Gut mucosal microbiota was analyzed in 190 samples from 87 Caucasian and Chinese subjects, from Australia and Hong Kong, comprising 22 patients with Crohn's disease, 30 patients with ulcerative colitis, 29 healthy controls, and 6 healthy relatives of patients with Crohn's disease. Bacterial 16S rRNA microarray and 454 pyrosequencing were performed. RESULTS: The microbiota was diverse in health, regardless of ethnicity or geography (operational taxonomic unit number and Shannon diversity index). Ethnicity and geography, however, did affect microbial composition. Crohn's disease resulted in reduced bacterial diversity, regardless of ethnicity or geography, and was the strongest determinant of composition. In ulcerative colitis, diversity was reduced in Chinese subjects only, suggesting that ethnicity is a determinant of bacterial diversity, whereas composition was determined by disease and ethnicity. Specific phylotypes were different between health and disease. Chinese patients with inflammatory bowel disease more often than healthy Chinese tended to have had a Western diet in childhood, in the East and West. CONCLUSION: The healthy microbiota is diverse but compositionally affected by geographical and ethnic factors. The microbiota is substantially altered in inflammatory bowel disease, but ethnicity may also play an important role. This may be key to the changing epidemiology in developing countries, and emigrants to the West.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional implications of IBD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Paediatric Crohn's disease is a disorder characterised by a chronic inflammation that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Intestinal dysbiosis is a key factor in the multifactorial pathogenesis of this disease. Different dietary supplements have been proposed as alternative therapy both on induction and on maintaining remission of this disease. OBJECTIVE: To review current scientific evidence of intestinal dysbiosis in paediatric Crohn's disease patients, as well as efficacy of dietary supplement therapy (especially probiotics). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extensive search of scientific publications was performed in specialized electronic databases: NBCI, Elsevier, Scielo, Scirus and Science Direct. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An increase of Proteobacteria and a reduction of Firmicutes were observed in Crohn's disease paediatric patients. However the results referring to phyla Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria are disperse. Referring the use of dietary supplements, the use of probiotics did not show any positive impact in paediatric Crohn's disease patients. CONCLUSIONS: A better knowledge and understanding of the bacterial flora modifications in paediatric Crohn's disease patients is possible with the current published results. However, it is not possible to define the precise microbiota associated or causing this disease. In addition, current results do not bring solid evidence of the efficacy of probiotic therapy in those patients.},

   abstract = {Secondary systemic (AA) amyloidosis is reported as a serious complication that occurs in long-standing Crohn's disease (CD), with an incidence of 0.3-10.9%. Various therapeutic approaches using medicines and elemental diet have been recommended, but still there are no established standards of treatment for secondary systemic amyloidosis in CD. Only a few studies have shown the role of TNFalpha ihibitors in the treatment of AA amyloidosis over a long term period. We report the case of a 24-year-old male with CD complicated by AA amyloidosis with renal and gastrointestinal tract involvement treated with infliximab as induction therapy. Intestinal AA amyloidosis progression occurred at the same time with the development of CD as an early complication, whereas duration of CD prior to the diagnosis of renal AA amyloidosis was 6 years. Infliximab therapy (3 infusions) caused a significant decrease of serum amyloid A protein (by 97.9%), C-reactive protein (by 70%), improvement of disease activity index, and CD caused clinical symptoms. At the same time gradual progression of the renal damage (reduction of renal function) was not affected by the treatment. Direct efficacy of infliximab infusions on serum amyloid protein level may support the hypothesis of TNFalpha induced reduction on the progression of AA amyloidosis described in previous study reports. Targeted histological analysis of tissue biopsy is crucial to clarify the presence of AA amyloidosis in CD induced multiorgan damage cases.},

   abstract = {It has been a big puzzle as why the inflammation of ulcerative colitis (UC) is limited to the mucosa, while in Crohn's disease (CD) the inflammation is transmural and can be seen in all layers of the gut. Here, I give a tentative explanation extended from the unified hypothesis I proposed on the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. This hypothesis suggested that both UC and CD are caused by weakening of the gut barrier due to damage of the protective mucus layer and the underlying tissue by the poorly inactivated digestive proteases resulting from a reduction of gut bacteria by dietary chemicals like saccharin and sucralose. However, the large amounts of bacteria in the colon make the recruitment of neutrophils and formation of crypt abscess the main manifestation of UC, while the infiltration of antigens and dietary particles in the small and large intestine mainly cause the recruitment of macrophages and formation of granulomas as the main manifestations in CD. The fast reacting and short life span of neutrophils make the fight and damage limited to the surface of the mucosa. In contrast, the long life span and constant movement of macrophages may bring the harmful agents deep into the tissue. Therefore, the pathogenesis of UC may be more like bacterial pneumonia, while CD may be more like pneumoconiosis or tuberculosis of the lung.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: One of the elements of treatment considering inflammatory bowel diseases is nutritional therapy. The duration of the above-mentioned depends on the prevalence of such symptoms as fever, bowel movements, length of the functioning gastrointestinal tract, stoma and intestinal fistula presence. Nutritional therapy is an essential element of successful treatment alongside pharmacological, surgical, and biological therapy, as well as other methods. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis considered as chronic diseases, lead towards physical and biopsychosocial disability, being responsible for the reduction in the quality of life. The aim of the study was to determine the quality of life after surgical procedures in case of patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, subjected to natural and parenteral nutrition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised 52 patients from the Department of Gastroenterology, Military Medical Institute, and Department of Surgery and Clinical Nutrition, Clinical Hospital in Warsaw. The study was performed between October, 2011 and April, 2012. The World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument - Bref (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to deter-mine the patients' quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: A lower quality of life was observed in case of patients subjected to parenteral nutrition, poor education, disease symptoms exacerbation, in the majority-rural inhabitants. The quality of life does not depend on gender, type of disease, family status, and additional medical care.},

   abstract = {Vitamin D deficiency is common among patients with Crohn's disease. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the best measure of an individual's vitamin D status and current cut-off ranges for sufficiency are debatable. Several factors contribute to vitamin D deficiency in Crohn's disease. These include inadequate exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake, impaired conversion of vitamin D to its active metabolite, increased catabolism, increased excretion and genetic variants in vitamin D hydroxylation and transport. The effects of low 25(OH)D on outcomes other than bone health are understudied in Crohn's disease. The aim of the present review is to discuss the potential roles of vitamin D and the possible levels required to achieve them. Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D may have roles in innate and adaptive immunity, in the immune-pathogenesis of Crohn's disease, prevention of Crohn's disease-related hospitalisations and surgery, in reducing disease severity and in colon cancer prevention. The present literature appears to suggest that 25(OH)D concentrations of >/=75 nmol/l may be required for non-skeletal effects; however, further research on optimal levels is required.},

Based on the results of existing microbiological, molecular, and immunological studies, Klebsiella microbe seems to have a key role in the initiation and perpetuation of the pathological damage involving the gut and joint tissues in patients with CD. Six different gastroenterology centres in the UK have reported elevated levels of antibodies to Klebsiella in CD patients. There is a relationship between high intake of starch-containing diet, enhanced growth of gut microbes, and the production of pullulanases by Klebsiella. It is proposed that eradication of these microbes by the use of antibiotics and low starch diet, in addition to the currently used treatment, could help in alleviating or halting the disease process in CD.},

   abstract = {Both ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic and potentially disabling interrelated conditions, which have been included under the group of spondyloarthropathies. The results of a large number of studies support the idea that an enteropathic pathogen, Klebsiella pneumoniae, is the most likely triggering factor involved in the initiation and development of these diseases. Increased starch consumptions by genetically susceptible individuals such as those possessing HLA-B27 allelotypes could trigger the disease in both AS and CD by enhancing the growth and perpetuation of the Klebsiella microbes in the bowel. Exposure to increased levels of these microbes will lead to the production of elevated levels of anti-Klebsiella antibodies as well as autoantibodies against cross-reactive self-antigens with resultant pathological lesions in the bowel and joints. Hence, a decrease of starch-containing products in the daily dietary intake could have a beneficial therapeutic effect on the disease especially when used in conjunction with the currently available medical therapies in the treatment of patients with AS and CD.},

There is little evidence, however, to support specific dietary changes and patients often receive contradictory advice. AIM: To review the literature on the impacts of diet on IBD causation and activity to produce guidance based on 'best available evidence'. METHOD: Review of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases from 1975 to 2012 using MeSH headings 'crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'enteral' 'diet' 'nutrition' 'fatty acid' and 'food additives'. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with a formula-defined feed is effective treatment for CD, but approximately 50% of patients relapse within 6 months of return to normal diet. There is no direct evidence of benefit from any other specific dietary modification in CD, but indirect evidence supports recommendation of a low intake of animal fat, insoluble fibre and processed fatty foods containing emulsifiers. Foods tolerated in sustained remission may not be tolerated following relapse. Some evidence supports vitamin D supplementation. In ulcerative colitis (UC), evidence is weaker, but high intakes of meat and margarine correlate with increased UC incidence and high meat intake also correlates with increased likelihood of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence from interventional studies to support specific dietary recommendations. Nevertheless, people with IBD deserve advice based on 'best available evidence' rather than no advice at all, although dietary intake should not be inappropriately restrictive. Further interventional studies of dietary manipulation are urgently required.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The principal diagnosis/indication for this assessment is chronic diarrhoea due to bile acid malabsorption (BAM). Diarrhoea can be defined as the abnormal passage of loose or liquid stools more than three times daily and/or a daily stool weight > 200 g per day and is considered to be chronic if it persists for more than 4 weeks. The cause of chronic diarrhoea in adults is often difficult to ascertain and patients may undergo several investigations without a definitive cause being identified. BAM is one of several causes of chronic diarrhoea and results from failure to absorb bile acids (which are required for the absorption of dietary fats and sterols in the intestine) in the distal ileum. OBJECTIVE: For people with chronic diarrhoea with unknown cause and in people with Crohn's disease and chronic diarrhoea with unknown cause (i.e. before resection): (1) What are the effects of selenium-75-homocholic acid taurine (SeHCAT) compared with no SeHCAT in terms of chronic diarrhoea, other health outcomes and costs? (2) What are the effects of bile acid sequestrants (BASs) compared with no BASs in people with a positive or negative SeHCAT test? (3) Does a positive or negative SeHCAT test predict improvement in terms of chronic diarrhoea, other health outcomes and costs? DATA SOURCES: A systematic review was conducted to summarise the evidence on the clinical effectiveness of SeHCAT for the assessment of BAM and the measurement of bile acid pool loss. Search strategies were based on target condition and intervention, as recommended in the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) guidance for undertaking reviews in health care and the Cochrane Handbook for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Reviews. The following databases were searched up to April 2012: MEDLINE; MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations; EMBASE; the Cochrane Databases; Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects; Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database; and Science Citation Index. Research registers and conference proceedings were also searched. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic review methods followed the principles outlined in the CRD guidance for undertaking reviews in health care and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Diagnostic Assessment Programme interim methods statement. In the health economic analysis, the cost-effectiveness of SeHCAT for the assessment of BAM, in patients with chronic diarrhoea, was estimated in two different populations. The first is the population of patients with chronic diarrhoea with unknown cause and symptoms suggestive of diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) and the second population concerns patients with Crohn's disease without ileal resection with chronic diarrhoea. For each population, three models were combined: (1) a short-term decision tree that models the diagnostic pathway and initial response to treatment (first 6 months); (2) a long-term Markov model that estimates the lifetime costs and effects for patients initially receiving BAS; and (3) a long-term Markov model that estimates the lifetime costs and effects for patients initially receiving regular treatment (IBS-D treatment in the first population and Crohn's treatment in the second population). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated as additional cost per additional responder in the short term (first 6 months) and per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in the long term (lifetime). RESULTS: We found three studies assessing the relationship between the SeHCAT test and response to treatment with cholestyramine. However, the studies had small numbers of patients with unknown cause chronic diarrhoea, and they used different cut-offs to define BAM. For the short term (first 6 months), when trial of treatment is not considered as a comparator, the optimal choice depends on the willingness to pay for an additional responder. For lower values (between pound1500 and pound4600) the choice will be no SeHCAT in all scenarios; for higher values either SeHCAT 10% or SeHCAT 15% becomes cost-effective. For the lifetime perspective, the various scenarios showed widely differing results: in the threshold range of pound20,000-30,000 per QALY gained we found as optimal choice either no SeHCAT, SeHCAT 5% (only IBS-D) or SeHCAT 15%. When trial of treatment is considered a comparator, the analysis showed that for the short term, trial of treatment is the optimal choice across a range of scenarios. For the lifetime perspective with trial of treatment, again the various scenarios show widely differing results. Depending on the scenario, in the threshold range of pound20,000-30,000 per QALY gained, we found as optimal choice either trial of treatment, no SeHCAT or SeHCAT 15%. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the various analyses show that for both populations considerable decision uncertainty exists and that no firm conclusions can be formulated about which strategy is optimal. Standardisation of the definition of a positive SeHCAT test should be the first step in assessing the usefulness of this test. As there is no reference standard for the diagnosis of BAM and SeHCAT testing provides a continuous measure of metabolic function, diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) studies are not the most appropriate study design. However, in studies where all patients are tested with SeHCAT and all patients are treated with BASs, response to treatment can provide a surrogate reference standard; further DTA studies of this type may provide information on the ability of SeHCAT to predict response to BASs. A potentially more informative option would be multivariate regression modelling of treatment response (dependent variable), with SeHCAT result and other candidate clinical predictors as covariates. Such a study design could also inform the definition of a positive SeHCAT result. STUDY REGISTRATION: The study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42012001911.

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) incidence has increased over the past fifty years but the explanation is unclear. CD can be brought into remission by liquid enteral feeding, but the mechanism for this response is unknown. We suggest that consumption of emulsifiers in processed foods may promote CD by increasing bacterial translocation. This is supported by evidence that (i) geographical variation in CD correlates with emulsifier consumption as does the increasing incidence of CD in Japan; (ii) although CD incidence also correlates with fat consumption, the response to enteral feeding is not affected by the fat content of the feed and (iii) very small concentrations of the emulsifier polysorbate 80 enhance bacterial translocation across intestinal epithelia. Undigested emulsifiers may increase bacterial translocation, particularly in the small intestine where the mucus layer is discontinuous. The hypothesis should be testable by trials of enteral feeding with/without emulsifiers.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We used computer modeling to investigate the influence of physicochemical stone risk factors on urinary supersaturation (SS) of calcium oxalate (CaOx) in patients with severe hyperoxaluria, relative hypocalciuria, hypocitraturia, and CaOx nephrolithiasis after extensive small bowel resection, usually performed for Crohn's disease. We also simulated different treatment strategies, including oral calcium supplements and citrate, in such patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A baseline urine model was derived by consolidating data acquired by ourselves with those from another patient cohort. Calcium and oxalate excretions in this model were altered to obtain an extreme case. For comparison, additional models were based on published urine data from normal subjects (N) and idiopathic CaOx stone formers (SF). The Joint Expert Speciation System was used to simulate different urine situations based on reported compositional values. RESULTS: [Ca(2+)][Ox(2-)] ionic concentration products and SS(CaOx) are substantially higher in enteric hyperoxaluric patients than in N and SF, despite their relatively lower calcium excretions. Molar Ca:Ox ratios are substantially lower in enteric hyperoxalurics than in N and SF. Oral calcium supplements can reduce SS(CaOx), but monitoring is required to avoid exceeding a safe dosing threshold. A simple calculation can alert the clinician that this threshold is being approached or even exceeded. Increasing urinary pH and citrate decreases SS(CaOx) but not to the same extent as decreasing Ox excretion. CONCLUSIONS: Calcium supplements can help reduce stone risk in patients with severe enteric hyperoxaluria, but initial efforts should be directed toward reducing urinary oxalate by reducing dietary oxalate. Citrate therapy that increases both urine pH and urinary citrate provides an additional therapeutic benefit.},

   abstract = {In this paper a review of the researches on the role of Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) in gastrointestinal diseases was presented. EcN is a non-pathogenic strain of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which has probiotic properties. In a number of studies conducted among humans and experimental animals the application of EcN in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases was observed. Most studies about EcN has been devoted to this organism efficacy in ulcerative colitis treatment. Comparable results were obtained, by citied authors, in the treatment (sustaining remission) of EcN and mesalazine in ulcerative colitis. Moreover, this probiotic therapy, compared to placebo, contributes to obtaining a faster remission and improvement of intestinal histopathology. The use of EcN in Crohn's disease has not been the subject of as many studies as in the case of ulcerative colitis. Assessing the importance of EcN in treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders, authors of the studies observed, that in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, who receiving this probiotic there was a pain, nausea and bloating reduction. In studies conducted among children a positive impact of EcN in prevention and treatment of diarrhea was demonstrated. Similar results were obtained in studies conducted in experimental animals. Based on the presented review it can be concluded that the strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is useful in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, especially in treatment of ulcerative colitis. This probiotic may constitute a part of treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. The effectiveness of this strain in treatment of Crohn's disease is not clearly established and further research are require.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disorders (IBD) are characterized by chronic and recurrent inflammatory reactions of the intestinal mucosa resulting in progressing ulcerating lesions. Research over the past decade clearly identified in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) a marked dysregulation of the intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis) as one trigger factor in these inflammatory processes, particularly in patients with a high genetic risk. When treating patients with CD, most drugs aim to control the inflammatory process (either by inhibiting inflammatory pathways or by reducing the activity of immune cells). Given the importance of the disturbed interaction between the microbiota and the host immune system, there might be a different therapeutic approach in targeting directly the intestinal microflora. There are good data to believe that the use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is one such option. Historically, enteral nutrition (EN) was used as supplemental nutritional therapy in CD patients with planned resection surgery. This treatment option showed unexpected and very powerful anti-inflammatory effects, and it was rapidly introduced as induction therapy for active CD. Several clinical trials and case series confirmed the efficacy of EN to induce remission in approximately 80% of patients equaling the potential of steroids. It is well established that EN has this strong anti-inflammatory potential only when given on an exclusive basis, without any additional food. This raises major compliance issues, probably one of the reasons why it is less used in adult patients. A recent study demonstrated that EEN has a specific effect on the intestinal microbiota, which is markedly different from steroid-induced remission, while all patients obtained complete clinical remission. These observations give a first basis for the understanding of the impact of EEN on dysbiosis in patients with CD.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are derived from traditional fermented foods, from beneficial commensals or from the environment. They act through diverse mechanisms affecting the composition or function of the commensal microbiota and by altering host epithelial and immunological responses. Certain probiotic interventions have shown promise in selected clinical conditions where aberrant microbiota have been reported, such as atopic dermatitis, necrotising enterocolitis, pouchitis and possibly irritable bowel syndrome. However, no studies have been conducted that can causally link clinical improvements to probiotic-induced microbiota changes. Whether a disease-prone microbiota pattern can be remodelled to a more robust, resilient and disease-free state by probiotic administration remains a key unanswered question. Progress in this area will be facilitated by: optimising strain, dose and product formulations, including protective commensal species; matching these formulations with selectively responsive subpopulations; and identifying ways to manipulate diet to modify bacterial profiles and metabolism.},

The etiology of the disease includes environmental and genetic factors. Its management presents a constant challenge for gastroenterologists and conventional surgeon. 5-Amninosalicylates, antibiotics, steroids, and immune modulators have been used to reduce the symptoms and for maintenance of remission. Unfortunately, long-term usage of these agents has been found to lead to severe toxicities, which are deterrent to the users. Pre-clinical studies carried out in the recent past have shown that certain dietary agents, spices, oils, and dietary phytochemicals that are consumed regularly possess beneficial effects in preventing/ameliorating UC. For the first time, this review addresses the use of these dietary agents and spices in the treatment and prevention of IBD and also emphasizes on the mechanisms responsible for their effects.},

Their etiology is still unclear, although several factors have been identified as major determinants for induction or relapses. Among these, the role of the "forgotten organ", gut microbiota, has become more appreciated in recent years. The delicate symbiotic relationship between the gut microbiota and the host appears to be lost in IBD. In this perspective, several studies have been conducted to assess the role of prebiotics and probiotics in gut microbiota modulation. This is a minireview aimed to address in an easy format (simple questions-simple answers) some common issues about the theme. An update on the role of selected constituents of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD is presented together with the analysis of the efficacy of gut microbiota modulation by prebiotics and probiotics administration in the management of IBD.},

   abstract = {Mucosal surfaces represent the largest areas of interactions of the host with its environment. Subsequently, the mucosal immune system has evolved complex strategies to maintain the integrity of the host by inducing protective immune responses against pathogenic and tolerance against dietary and commensal microbial antigens within the broad range of molecules the intestinal epithelium is exposed to. Among many other specialized cell subsets, myeloid cell populations - due to their strategic location in the subepithelial lamina propria - are the first ones to scavenge and process these intestinal antigens and to send consecutive signals to other immune and non-immune cell subsets. Thus, myeloid cell populations represent attractive targets for clinical intervention in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) as they initiate and modulate inflammatory or regulatory immune response and shape the intestinal T cell pool. Here, we discuss the interactions of the intestinal microbiota with dendritic cell and macrophage populations and review in this context the literature on four promising candidate molecules that are critical for the induction and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis on the one hand, but also for the initiation and propagation of chronic intestinal inflammation on the other.},

In the other hand, Crohn's disease is frequently associated with nutritional deficiencies probably as result of disease activity and poor oral intake. AIMS: To investigate the dietary intake in patients with Crohn's disease in comparison with matched population controls and to assess the correlation between the results of the dietary enquete, nutritional status and disease activity. METHODS: We conducted a prospective case control study in patients with Crohn's disease and matched controls. All subjects were evaluated in respect of dietary intake (based on "NUTISTAR" logiciel) and nutritional status. RESULTS: We studied 23 patients and 23 controls. There was no statistical difference between patients and controls according to the proportion of carbohydrates, fat and protein intakes. Energy intakes were significantly lower in patients with Crohn's disease (1991 + 678 kcal/j) compared to controls (2537 + 345 kcal/j) (p=0.007) ; and in active disease (1353 + 308 kcal/j) compared to inactive disease patients (2481 + 415 kcal/j) (p<0.0001). In Crohn's disease patients, correlation study showed that energy intakes were correlated with CDAI (p<0.0001 ; r = - 0.74) and BMI (p=0.03 ; r = 0.45). CONCLUSION: In Crohn's disease, an inadequate dietary intake is correlated with nutritional status and disease activity.},

   abstract = {Growth failure is common in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), mainly those with Crohn's disease (CD). The prevalence of growth failure varies in different cohorts, mainly due to the heterogeneity of the population treated by the reporting centers (primary vs. referral), but can be as high as 40% of the cases. Factors related to growth impairment in CD include low dietary intake, stool loss, increased energy and nutrient requirements, the use of medications (for example, steroids interfere with the IGF-1 axis), disease activity (the effect of inflammation on growth), genetic background (parents height), and physical activity. In animals, malnutrition, genetic polymorphism, elevated pro inflammatory cytokines, and exposure to lipopolysaccharide are involved in growth impairment in IBD, while malnutrition, genetic polymorphism and increased inflammation have been shown to be associated with growth impairment in humans. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is the preferred first line treatment in CD. EEN induces remission, prolongs remission and affects growth failure via its effect on malnutrition and inflammation. However, similar to drug treatment, EEN effect on growth failure is limited, most probably due to incomplete control of inflammation. Children with IBD should be assessed for growth on diagnosis and on each follow-up visit. New nutritional strategies, identification of genetic polymorphisms that respond to EN, and methods to increase lean body mass (physical activity) are needed in order to improve growth in our IBD patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Stress is thought to be one of the triggers of relapses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We examined the rate of relapse in IBD patients before and after the Great East Japan Earthquake. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTINGS: 13 hospitals in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: 546 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 357 Crohn's disease (CD) patients who received outpatient and inpatient care at 13 hospitals located in the area that were seriously damaged by the earthquake. Data on patient's clinical characteristics, disease activity and deleterious effects of the earthquake were obtained from questionnaires and hospital records. PRIMARY OUTCOME: We evaluated the relapse rate (from inactive to active) across two consecutive months before and two consecutive months after the earthquake. In this study, we defined 'active' as conditions with a partial Mayo score=2 or more (UC) or a Harvey-Bradshaw index=6 or more (CD). RESULTS: Among the UC patients, disease was active in 167 patients and inactive in 379 patients before the earthquake. After the earthquake, the activity scores increased significantly (p<0.0001). A total of 86 patients relapsed (relapse rate=15.8%). The relapse rate was about twice that of the corresponding period in the previous year. Among the CD patients, 86 patients had active disease and 271 had inactive disease before the earthquake. After the earthquake, the activity indices changed little. A total of 25 patients experienced a relapse (relapse rate=7%). The relapse rate did not differ from that of the corresponding period in the previous year. Multivariate analyses revealed that UC, changes in dietary oral intake and anxiety about family finances were associated with the relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Life-event stress induced by the Great East Japan Earthquake was associated with relapse in UC but not CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition is effective for inducing remission in active pediatric Crohn's disease. Partial enteral nutrition (PEN) with free diet is ineffective for inducing remission, suggesting that the mechanism depends on exclusion of free diet. We developed an alternative diet based on PEN with exclusion of dietary components hypothesized to affect the microbiome or intestinal permeability. METHODS: Children and young adults with active disease defined as a pediatric Crohn's disease activity index >7.5 or Harvey-Bradshaw index >/=4 received a 6-week structured Crohn's disease exclusion diet that allowed access to specific foods and restricted exposure to all other foods, and up to 50% of dietary calories from a polymeric formula. Remission, C-reactive protien, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were reevaluated at 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was remission at 6 weeks defined as Harvey-Bradshaw index </=3 for all patients and pediatric Crohn's disease activity index <7.5 in children. RESULTS: We treated 47 patients (mean age, 16.1 +/- 5.6 yr; 34 children). Response and remission were obtained in 37 (78.7%) and 33 (70.2%) patients, respectively. Mean pediatric Crohn's disease activity index decreased from 27.7 +/- 9.4 to 5.4 +/- 8 (P < 0.001), Harvey-Bradshaw index from 6.4 +/- 2.7 to 1.8 +/- 2.9 (P < 0.001). Remission was obtained in 70% of children and 69% of adults. Normalization of previously elevated CRP occurred in 21 of 30 (70%) patients in remission. Seven patients used the diet without PEN; 6 of 7 obtained remission. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary therapy involving PEN with an exclusion diet seems to lead to high remission rates in early mild-to-moderate luminal Crohn's disease in children and young adults.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are both typified by an altered intestinal microbiota, and gene associations imply various defects in the mucosal barrier and in the innate immune response to bacteria. This review aims to assess how alterations in diet or use of modified bacteria could have therapeutic effects in CD or UC. METHODS: A MEDLINE search using the terms 'prebiotic', 'genetically modified bacteria', 'mucosal barrier in association with ulcerative colitis', 'Crohn's disease' or 'microbiota'. RESULTS: A large body of data from in vitro and animal studies shows promise for therapeutic approaches that target the microbiota. Approaches include dietary supplementation with fermentable fibres (prebiotics) and soluble fibres that block bacterial-epithelial adherence (contrabiotics), enhancement of the mucosal barrier with phosphatidylcholine, and use of genetically modified bacteria that express IL-10 or protease inhibitors. Vitamin D supplementation also shows promise, acting via enhancement of innate immunity. Clinical trials have shown benefit with enterically delivered phosphatidylcholine supplementation in UC and near-significant benefit with vitamin D supplementation in CD. CONCLUSION: Strategies that target the microbiota or the host defence against it appear to be good prospects for therapy and deserve greater investment.},

   abstract = {The term gossypiboma is used to describe a mass of cotton matrix left behind in a body cavity intraoperatively. The most common site reported is the abdominal cavity. It can present with abscess, intestinal obstruction, malabsorption, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and fistulas. A 37-year-old woman presented with pain in the right hypochondrium for 2 months following open cholecystectomy. As she did not improve with proton pump inhibitors, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was done, which showed a possible gauze piece stained with bile in the first part of the duodenum. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen revealed an abnormal fistulous communication of the first part of duodenum with proximal transverse colon, with a hypodense, mottled lesion within the lumen of the proximal transverse colon plugging the fistula, suggestive of a gossypiboma. Excision of the coloduodenal fistula, primary duodenal repair, and feeding jejunostomy was done. The patient recovered well and is now tolerating normal diet. Coloduodenal fistula is usually caused by Crohn's disease, malignancy, right-sided diverticulitis, and gall stone disease. Isolated coloduodenal fistula due to gossypiboma has not been reported in the literature so far to the best of our knowledge. We report this case of coloduodenal fistula secondary to gossypiboma for its rarity and diagnostic challenge.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Differences between populations might be reflected in their different genetic risk maps to complex diseases, for example, inflammatory bowel disease. We here investigated the role of known inflammatory bowel disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a subset of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) from the Northeastern European countries Lithuania and Latvia and evaluated possible epistatic interactions between these genetic variants. METHODS: We investigated 77 SNPs derived from 5 previously published genome-wide association studies for Crohn's disease and UC. Our study panel comprised 444 Lithuanian and Latvian patients with UC and 1154 healthy controls. Single marker case-control association and SNP-SNP epistasis analyses were performed. RESULTS: We found 14 SNPs tagging 9 loci, including 21q21.1, NKX2-3, MST1, the HLA region, 1p36.13, IL10, JAK2, ORMDL3, and IL23R, to be associated with UC. Interestingly, the association of UC with previously identified variants in the HLA region was not the strongest association in our study (P = 4.34 x 10, odds ratio [OR] = 1.25), which is in contrast to all previously published studies. No association with any disease subphenotype was found. SNP-SNP interaction analysis showed significant epistasis between SNPs in the PTPN22 (rs2476601) and C13orf31 (rs3764147) genes and increased risk for UC (P = 1.64 x 10, OR = 2.44). The association has been confirmed in the Danish study group (P = 0.04, OR = 3.25). CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the association of the 9 loci (21q21.1, 1p36.13, NKX2-3, MST1, the HLA region, IL10, JAK2, ORMDL3, and IL23R) with UC in the Lithuanian-Latvian population. SNP-SNP interaction analyses showed that the combination of SNPs in the PTPN22 (rs2476601) and C13orf31 (rs3764147) genes increase the risk for UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental enteropathy (EE) is subclinical, diffuse villous atrophy characterized by T cell infiltration of the small intestinal mucosa associated with nutrient malabsorption and stunting. EE is assessed by the lactulose:mannitol (L:M) test, whereby nonmetabolized sugars are ingested and quantified in the urine. Multiple micronutrient (MN) deficiency morphologically mimics EE, and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce mucosal inflammation in Crohn disease. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that supplementary MNs, with or without fish oil (FO), would improve L:M in rural Malawian children aged 1-3 y compared with a control (C) group receiving a placebo. METHODS: The MNs and FO provided the Recommended Dietary Intake for 26 vitamins, minerals, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. This was a 3-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with the primary outcomes being the change in L:M (DeltaL:M) after 12 and 24 wk of supplementation. Comparisons were made for DeltaL:M after 12 and 24 wk within each group by using a Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test, because the data are not normally distributed. RESULTS: A total of 230 children had specimens adequate for analysis; all had an abnormal baseline L:M, defined as >0.10. After 12 wk, children who received MNs + FO had a DeltaL:M [mean (95% CI)] of -0.10 (-0.04, -0.15; P = 0.001), and children receiving only MNs had DeltaL:M of -0.12 (-0.03, -0.21; P = 0.002). After 24 wk, children who received MNs + FO had a DeltaL:M of -0.09 (-0.03, -0.15; P = 0.001); children receiving only MNs had a DeltaL:M of -0.11 (-0.02, -0.20; P = 0.001), and the C group had DeltaL:M of -0.07 (0.02, -0.16); P = 0.002). Linear growth was similar in all groups, approximately 4.3 cm over 24 wk. CONCLUSION: Although the effect was modest, these data suggest MNs can transiently ameliorate EE in rural African children. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01593033.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 38 (28 Male; 10 Female) hospitalized patients with moderate or severe IBD (13 with Crohn's disease (CD); 25 with Ulcerative colitis (UC)) were included. At stage 1, the disease severity, clinical symptoms and, signs, food consumption and nutritional status by using subjective global assessment (SGA) were recorded. At stage 2, the patients were blindly randomized into a Study Group and Controls. In the Study Group, a standard enteral product was added into the regulated hospital diets, but for the Controls, deficits were regulated by only hospital diets for 3 weeks. the independent variables were the group, the disease and its activity, age, Body body mass index (BMI), weight loss history, the hospitalization period; the dependent variables were SGA, bowel movements, change in nutritional status, disease severity, clinical findings, and also consumption of macronutrients. RESULTS: Prevalance of malnutrition (SGA-B or SGA-C) for all the patients was 92.1% at the beginning and 71.1% at the end of study. Improvements in disease activity score for the patients with UC were statistically significant in both the Study Group and the Controls (p=0.006 for the Study Group and p=0.001 for the Controls, respectively). Macronutrients, total and water soluble fiber consumption levels improved, with statistically significant differences for all the groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is a major problem in patients with IBD. Not only the regulation of hospital food, but also enteral nutritional support, improved their levels of malnutrition, as well as their energy, macronutrients, and fiber consumption, and SGA is an easy method for nutritional monitoring.},

   abstract = {Inadequate dietary intake of the essential trace element selenium (Se) is thought to be a risk factor for several chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. Biological actions of Se occur through low-molecular weight metabolites and through selenoproteins. Several key selenoproteins including glutathione peroxidases; selenoproteins M, P, and S; and selenium-binding protein 1 have been detected in the intestine. Interestingly, Se and antioxidant selenoproteins are known to modulate differentiation and function of immune cells and contribute to avoid excessive immune responses. This review discusses the role of Se and intestinal selenoproteins in inflammatory bowel diseases, based on data from human, animal, and in vitro studies. In humans, Se deficiency is commonly observed in patients with Crohn's disease. In animal models of experimental colitis, the Se status was negatively correlated with the severity of the disease. While the cause-effect relationship of these observations remains to be clarified, the beneficial outcome of dietary Se supplementation and an optimization of selenoprotein biosynthesis in murine inflammatory bowel disease models have led to investigations of targets and actions of Se in the gastrointestinal tract. The Se status affects gene expression, signaling pathways, and cellular functions in the small and large intestine as well as the gut microbiome composition. This data, particularly from animal experiments, hold promise that adequate dietary Se supply may counteract chronic intestinal inflammation in humans.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Laparoscopy combined with an enhanced recovery pathway (ERP) is widely considered to be the first-choice option for patients with colorectal cancer. However, no previous reports have focused on patients with Crohn's disease (CD) treated by laparoscopy and ERP. METHODS: Twenty patients with CD underwent laparoscopic ileocecal resection with an ERP at two institutions. The ERP protocol included no bowel preparation nor fasting, no nasogastric tube, no abdominal drains, early removal of urinary catheter, early solid dietary intake and mobilization, opioid-sparing analgesia and restrictive fluid management. This group was compared with a matched historical control group of 70 CD patients who underwent laparoscopic ileocecal resection treated with conventional care. RESULTS: Compliance with the ERP was high (>/=80 %) for all items except no drain placement. A significantly earlier return of bowel function (time to first flatus and stool) was observed in the ERP group. Mean postoperative and total length of stay were significantly shorter in the ERP group. Postoperative complications were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported experience of laparoscopy with ERP in CD patients and suggests that optimized perioperative care combined with minimally invasive techniques may lead to further improvements in surgical outcomes for CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is supported by migration studies and increasing incidences in line with Westernisation. AIM: To give a complete overview of studies associating habitual diet with the onset or relapses in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: A structured search in Pubmed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE was performed using defined key words, including only full text papers in English language. RESULTS: Forty-one studies were identified, investigating onset (n = 35), relapses (n = 5) or both (n = 1). Several studies reported high intake of sugar or sugar-containing foods (n = 7 UC, n = 12 CD), and low intake of fruits and/or vegetables (n = 5 UC, n = 10 CD) to be associated with an increased onset risk. However, these findings could not be confirmed by similar or higher numbers of other studies. A possible protective role was found for grain-derived products in CD onset, but results were inconsistent for dietary fibre in UC and CD and grain-derived products in UC. No definite conclusions could be drawn for unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), protein and energy intake due to limited and/or inconsistent results. Six studies reported on diet and relapse risk, of which only two (n = 1 UC, n = 1 CD) had a prospective follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence is not sufficient to draw firm conclusions on the role of specific food components or nutrients in the aetiology of IBD. Furthermore, large prospective studies into the role of habitual diet as a trigger of relapses are needed, to identify new therapeutic or preventive targets.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is one of the most common diseases worldwide, resulting from a combination of environmental (gluten) and genetic (human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genes) factors. Depending on the geographical location, the prevalence of CD has been estimated to approximate 0.5-1%. The only treatment currently available for CD is a gluten-free diet (GFD) excluding gluten-containing cereals such as wheat, rye, and barley, and other foodstuffs with natural or added gluten. However, adherence rates and patient acceptance are often poor. Moreover, even in fully adherent patients, the diet may fail to induce clinical or histological improvement. Hence, it is unsurprising that studies show CD patients to be highly interested in non-dietary alternatives. The following review focuses on current pathophysiological concepts of CD, spotlighting those pathways which may serve as new possible, non-dietary therapeutic targets in the treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inhibition of lymphocyte trafficking by treatment with an anti-alpha4 integrin antibody has been clinically validated as a therapeutic approach for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and the orally effective 'anti-alpha4 integrin therapy' may be more convenient in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacological profile and anti-inflammatory effect of a novel, orally active small molecule alpha4 integrin antagonist, AJM300. METHODS: The binding specificity/potency of HCA2969 (the active metabolite of AJM300) were investigated in vitro. The pharmacodynamics for alpha4 integrin antagonism of AJM300 was investigated in mice. The anti-inflammatory effect of AJM300 fed in a diet and the anti-alpha4 integrin monoclonal antibody was evaluated in a mouse colitis model induced by transfer of IL-10 deficient T cells. RESULTS: HCA2969 selectively inhibited the in vitro binding of alpha4 integrin (alpha4beta7/alpha4beta1) to the cell adhesion molecules. Oral treatment with AJM300 dose-dependently inhibited lymphocyte homing to Peyer's patches and increased the peripheral lymphocyte count in the same dose range. AJM300 dose-dependently prevented the development of experimental colitis in mice. A significant inhibition of colon weight increase was accompanied by inhibition of T-cell infiltration into the lamina propria of colon. The maximum efficacy of AJM300 (1% diet) was comparable to that achieved by the saturated alpha4 integrin blockade with antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Oral treatment with the selective small molecule alpha4 integrin antagonist (AJM300) prevented the development of colitis and its efficacy was comparable to that of the anti-alpha4 integrin antibody.},

   abstract = {Mechanisms responsible for derangements in Fe homeostasis in chronic inflammatory conditions are not entirely clear. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that inflammation affects the expression of Fe-related proteins in the duodenum and monocytes of patients with chronic inflammatory disorders, thus contributing to dysregulated Fe homeostasis. Duodenal mucosal samples and peripheral blood monocytes obtained from patients with chronic inflammatory disorders, namely ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and rheumatoid arthritis, were used for gene and protein expression studies. Hb levels were significantly lower and serum C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in patients in the disease groups. The gene expression of several Fe-related proteins in the duodenum was significantly up-regulated in patients with UC and CD. In patients with UC, the protein expression of divalent metal transporter 1 and ferroportin, which are involved in the absorption of dietary non-haem Fe, was also found to be significantly higher in the duodenal mucosa. The gene expression of the duodenal proteins of interest correlated positively with one another and negatively with Hb. In patients with UC, the gene expression of Fe-related proteins in monocytes was found to be unaffected. In a separate group of patients with UC, serum hepcidin levels were found to be significantly lower than those in the control group. In conclusion, the expression of Fe-related proteins was up-regulated in the duodenum of patients with chronic inflammatory conditions in the present study. The effects appeared to be secondary to anaemia and the consequent erythropoietic drive.},

The primary therapies are medications that possess anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects. Given the high use of complementary alternative medicines in pediatric IBD, a prospective tolerability study of curcumin, an herbal therapy with known anti-inflammatory effects, was conducted to assess possible dosage in children with IBD. METHODS: Prospectively, patients with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis in remission or with mild disease (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] <30 or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [PUCAI] score <34) were enrolled in a tolerability study. All patients received curcumin in addition to their standard therapy. Patients initially received 500 mg twice per day for 3 weeks. Using the forced-dose titration design, doses were increased up to 1 g twice per day at week 3 for a total of 3 weeks and then titrated again to 2 g twice per day at week 6 for 3 weeks. Validated measures of disease activity, using the PUCAI and PCDAI, and the Monitoring of Side Effect System score were obtained at weeks 3, 6, and 9. RESULTS: All patients tolerated curcumin well, with the only symptom that was consistently reported during all 3 visits being an increase in gassiness, which occurred in only 2 patients. Three patients saw improvement in PUCAI/PCDAI score. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that curcumin may be used as an adjunctive therapy for individuals seeking a combination of conventional medicine and alternative medicine.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Crohn disease is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation in the absence of a recognized etiology. Nutritional therapy in the form of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has an established role within pediatric Crohn disease. Following exclusive enteral nutrition's success, many dietary therapies focusing on the elimination of specific complex carbohydrates have been anecdotally reported to be successful. METHODS: Many of these therapies have not been evaluated scientifically; therefore, we reviewed the medical records of our patients with Crohn disease on the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD). RESULTS: Seven children with Crohn disease receiving the SCD and no immunosuppressive medications were retrospectively evaluated. Duration of the dietary therapy ranged from 5 to 30 months, with an average of 14.6+/-10.8 months. Although the exact time of symptom resolution could not be determined through chart review, all symptoms were notably resolved at a routine clinic visit 3 months after initiating the diet. Each patient's laboratory indices, including serum albumin, C-reactive protein, hematocrit, and stool calprotectin, either normalized or significantly, improved during follow-up clinic visits. CONCLUSIONS: This chart review suggests that the SCD and other low complex carbohydrate diets may be possible therapeutic options for pediatric Crohn disease. Further prospective studies are required to fully assess the safety and efficacy of the SCD, or any other low complex SCDs in pediatric patients with Crohn disease.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the preventative effect of oral GLN supplementation against acetic acid (AA) induced intestinal injury in a rat. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four experimental groups: control (CONTR) rats underwent laparotomy, control-glutamine (CONTR-GLN) rats were treated with enteral glutamine given in drinking water (2%) 48 hours before and five days following laparotomy, AA rats underwent laparotomy and injection of AA into an isolated jejunal loop, and acetic acid-glutamine (AA-GLN) rats underwent AA-induced injury and were treated with enteral GLN 48 hours before and 5 days following laparotomy. Intestinal mucosal damage (Park's injury score), mucosal structural changes, enterocyte proliferation and enterocyte apoptosis were determined five days following intestinal injury. Western blotting was used to determine p-ERK and bax protein levels. AA-induced intestinal injury resulted in a significantly increased intestinal injury score with concomitant inhibition of cell turnover (reduced proliferation and enhanced apoptosis). Treatment with dietary GLN supplementation resulted in a decreased intestinal injury score with concomitant stimulation of cell turnover (enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis). In conclusion, pre-treatment with oral GLN prevents mucosal injury and improves intestinal recovery following AA-induced intestinal injury in rats.},

Experiments were limited to double-blind placebo controlled trials. Five studies observing CD relapse rates and three studies examining biochemical changes were evaluated. The studies reviewed show contradicting information regarding the efficacy of omega-3 for CD. While some studies have shown supplementation with omega-3 results in sustained remission from disease, other studies concluded no correlation between omega-3 supplementation and improved remission rates. Studies investigating biochemical variables suggest favorable changes in immunological milieu, including modifications of lipid profiles and cytokine production. The studies reviewed are adversely limited by low number of participants, short duration of study and other significant deficits. Limited data remain available and current literature indicated mixed conclusions regarding the efficacy of omega-3 for treatment of CD. Further large-scale studies of longer duration are necessary.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in parallel genomic processing and computational mapping have been applied to the native human microbial environment to provide a new understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease. In particular, studies of the distal gut microbiome have proposed that changes in gut microbiota are related to obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and Western diet. We examined the changes in the distal gut microbiome composition as it relates to the lean and obese phenotypes, particularly after surgical weight loss. A PubMed search of publications from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2012, used the search terms weight, obesity, microbiome, and bariatric surgery. We included studies that provided information on subjects' weight and/or body mass index and a formal assessment of the microbiome. Certain bacteria, specifically the archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii, have enhanced ability to metabolize dietary substrate, thereby increasing host energy intake and weight gain. With weight loss, there is a decrease in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla. One major finding from microbial sequencing analyses after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the comparative overabundance of Proteobacteria in the distal gut microbiome, which is distinct from the changes seen in weight loss without Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This review provides the practicing surgeon with (1) an update on the state of a rapidly innovating branch of clinical bioinformatics, specifically, the microbiome; (2) a new understanding of the microbiome changes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and weight loss; and (3) a basis for understanding further clinical applications of studies of the distal gut microbiome, such as in Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, and infectious colitis.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is commonly believed to increase the risk of bone mineral loss, leading to osteoporosis and an increased risk of disabling fractures. In this narrative review, we will presenting a summary of the published medical literature in regards to the relationship between IBD and the development of osteoporosis, bone mineral loss, and fractures. We will explore the epidemiology of metabolic bone disease in IBD, focusing on the prevalence and both the general and IBD-specific risk factors for the development of osteoporosis and of fracture in persons with IBD. We will also examine the role of the inflammatory process in IBD promoting excessive bone mineral loss, as well as the role that low body mass, corticosteroid use, diet, and nutrient malabsorption play in contributing to bone disease. Last, we will discuss our recommendation for: screening for osteoporosis in IBD patients, the use of preventative strategies, and therapeutic interventions for treating osteoporosis in persons with IBD.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease, is a subject of increasing interest. Loss-of-function mutations in nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) are strong genetic factors linked to Crohn's disease, which eventually leads to an excessive mucosal inflammatory response directed against components of normal gut microbiota. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in inflammation processes, as well as in transduction of signals from receptors for several cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). ROS activate nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via IkappaB kinase (IKK) through the PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway. Therefore, this pathway is recognized to play a key role in Crohn's disease. Loss of function has been demonstrated to occur as an early event in a wide variety of diseases. Given this prevalent involvement in a number of diseases, the molecular development that modulates this pathway has been the subject of several studies. In addition, it has been the focus of extensive research and drug discovery activities. A better understanding of the molecular assemblies may reveal novel targets for the therapeutic development against Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of 10%-15% developing colorectal cancer (CRC) that is a common disease of high economic costs in developed countries. The CRC has been increasing in recent years and its mortality rates are very high. Multiple biological and biochemical factors are responsible for the onset and progression of this pathology. Moreover, it appears absolutely necessary to investigate the environmental factors favoring the onset of CRC and the promotion of colonic health. The gut microflora, or microbiota, has an extensive diversity both quantitatively and qualitatively. In utero, the intestine of the mammalian fetus is sterile. At birth, the intestinal microbiota is acquired by ingesting maternal anal or vaginal organisms, ultimately developing into a stable community, with marked variations in microbial composition between individuals. The development of IBD is often associated with qualitative and quantitative disorders of the intestinal microbial flora (dysbiosis). The healthy human gut harbours about 10 different bacterial species distributed in colony forming units which colonize the gastrointestinal tract. The intestinal microbiota plays a fundamental role in health and in the progression of diseases such as IBD and CRC. In healthy subjects, the main control of intestinal bacterial colonization occurs through gastric acidity but other factors such as endoluminal temperature, competition between different bacterial strains, peristalsis and drugs can influence the intestinal microenvironment. The microbiota exerts diverse physiological functions to include: growth inhibition of pathogenic microorganisms, synthesis of compounds useful for the trophism of colonic mucosa, regulation of intestinal lymphoid tissue and synthesis of amino acids. Furthermore, mucus seems to play an important role in protecting the intestinal mucosa and maintaining its integrity. Changes in the microbiota composition are mainly influenced by diet and age, as well as genetic factors. Increasing evidence indicates that dysbiosis favors the production of genotoxins and metabolites associated with carcinogenesis and induces dysregulation of the immune response which promotes and sustains inflammation in IBD leading to carcinogenesis. A disequilibrium in gut microflora composition leads to the specific activation of gut associated lymphoid tissue. The associated chronic inflammatory process associated increases the risk of developing CRC. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two major IBDs characterized by an early onset and extraintestinal manifestations, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The pathogenesis of both diseases is complex and not yet fully known. However, it is widely accepted that an inappropriate immune response to microbial flora can play a pivotal role in IBD pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {The etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases which include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease has not yet been clarified. Several hypotheses suggest a change in composition of gut microflora along with an impaired mucosal barrier that lead to excessive mucosal immunologic responses. Increased production of nitric oxide (NO) contributes greatly to the tissue injury caused by chronic inflammation. Evidence indicates that the mucus layer covering the epithelium is altered during UC and experimental colitis. Our aim in this study was to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of probiotic during DSS-induced colitis by modulating the immune system and colonic mucus production. For that purpose, the probiotic formulation Ultrabiotique((R)) (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifidobacterium breve) was administered daily for 7 d to mice with colitis. Probiotic supplementation improved clinical symptoms and histological alterations observed during DSS induced colitis. Ultrabiotique((R)) treatment down regulated the NO production by peritoneal macrophages of DSS-treated mice and enhanced mucus production in both DSS-treated and healthy mice. In conclusion, the modification of microflora by the Ultrabiotique((R)) played a beneficial role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier and promoted tissue repair.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In the era of modern multidisciplinary clinical management, very little is known about the prevalence and presentation of malnutrition in children with gastrointestinal disorders (GastroD) particularly employing composite, global measures of nutritional status. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Anthropometry, body composition, dietary intake, eating habits and grip strength were assessed with bedside methods in 168 patients from outpatient gastroenterology clinics (n, median (IQR) years; Crohn's disease (CD): n=53, 14.2 (11.6:15.4); ulcerative colitis (UC): n=27, 12.2 (10.7:14.2); coeliac disease: n=31, 9.3 (7.5:13.6); other GastroD: n=57, 9.8 (7.2:13.8)) and compared with 62 contemporary healthy controls (n, median (IQR): 9.8 (6.9:13.8)) and the results of the recent UK, National Diet and Nutritional Survey (NDNS). RESULTS: Children with CD had lower BMI z-scores than controls (median (IQR): -0.3 (-0.9:0.4) vs 0.3 (-0.6:1.4); P=0.02) but only 2% were classified as thin (BMI z-score <-2 s.d.). The prevalence of obesity in children with UC was 19%, 6% in CD, 11% in children with other GastroD and 15% in controls. No difference was found in grip strength measurement between groups. Except for CD children, the proportion of patients with suboptimal micronutrient intake was similar to that of controls and the cohort of children from the latest NDNS. A higher proportion of children with CD had suboptimal intake for riboflavin, vitamin B6 and calcium and consumed significantly more meat products, juices (including carbonated drinks), spreads/jams and crisps and savoury snacks and significantly fewer portions of dairy, fish, fruits and vegetables compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: GastroD affect children's body composition, growth, strength, dietary intake and eating habits, particularly CD, but to a lesser extent than expected.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The sudden change in the dietary habits of the Japanese population towards a European/American-style diet since the 1960s is thought to be responsible for the recent increase in the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Japan. Dietary fatty acid intake influences the fatty acid profiles of vital cell membranes, which might be a source of inflammatory mediators. METHODS: We investigated the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membrane in 90 healthy Japanese and 43 initial-onset IBD patients (ulcerative colitis, UC: 25; Crohn's disease, CD: 18) who had not undergone any dietary intervention to examine the role fatty acids play in the onset of IBD. RESULTS: The erythrocyte membrane n-3/n-6 ratio of the initial-onset IBD patients was 0.42 +/- 0.13, which was not significantly different from that of the healthy Japanese subjects (0.41 +/- 0.13). However, the CD patients displayed a significantly lower mean percentage weight (MPW) of linoleic acid (LA) than the healthy subjects (8.25 +/- 1.75 vs. 9.90 +/- 1.29; p < 0.001), while their MPW of arachidonic acid (AA) was significantly higher than those of the healthy subjects and UC patients (11.22 +/- 2.18 vs. 9.76 +/- 1.64, p < 0.01; vs. 9.58 +/- 1.97, p < 0.01, respectively). The mean delta 6-desaturation index of the CD patients was significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects (1.61 +/- 0.65 vs. 1.11 +/- 0.26; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The CD patients displayed significantly higher and lower MPW of AA and LA, respectively, than the healthy subjects, suggesting that delta 6-desaturase is hyperactivated in CD. The cell membrane fatty acid profile might be a therapeutic target in CD.},

METHODS: A retrospective investigation was conducted on a cohort of newly diagnosed children and adolescents with IBD ages 0 to 18 years between 2002 and 2010 and residing in NE Slovenia. The phenotypic characteristics were determined at presentation and during follow-up. The location of Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was assessed according to the Paris classification at diagnosis, and later in patients who had a follow-up period >2 years. The type of therapy at diagnosis and during follow-up, and the need for surgery were determined. The study covered approximately one-third of the total pediatric population (0-18 years). RESULTS: In total, 107 cases of IBD were diagnosed during the study period. The mean annual incidence (per 100,000) was 7.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.3-9.2) for all IBD, 4.6 (95% CI 3.6-5.9) for CD, and 2.8 (95% CI 1.9-3.8) for UC. The incidences of total IBD, CD, and UC increased from 5.7 (3.8-8.2), 3.9 (2.3-6.1), and 1.8 (0.8-3.5) in the period 2002-2004, respectively, to 8.9 (6.3-12.2), 5.0 (3.1-7.6), and 3.4 (1.9-5.6) in the period 2008-2010, respectively. During the follow-up, the proportion of complicated CD disease behavior (stricturing/penetrating) had doubled. A total of 18.5% of patients with CD underwent bowel surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of childhood IBD in the northeastern part of the country is high and comparable with that reported from the developed western countries of Europe, and is probably still increasing. This increase may be the result of changes in the lifestyle, especially in dietary habits during the last 20 years.},

   abstract = {AIM: The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and evolution of anaemia in prospectively followed children and adolescents diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: The BELCRO registry (inclusion May 2008-April 2010), describing current clinical treatment practice of children diagnosed with CD, provided data on age, height, body mass index (BMI), paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI), therapy and haemoglobin (Hb) at diagnosis 12 and 24 months follow-up. Anaemia was defined as Hb < -2 sd, while severe anaemia was defined as Hb < -4 sd. Patients were classified as child </=13 and adolescent >13 years of age. RESULT: Ninety-six were included, 13 dropped out due to insufficient Hb data (37 females/46 males; median age 13.3 years, range 2.2-17.8 years). At diagnosis, the median Hb sd was -2.66 (-8.4; 1.07) and was correlated with the PCDAI (p = 0.013). At diagnosis, 51/83 (61%) were anaemic and all had active disease. Hb z-score significantly improved (p < 0.0001) but 26/68 (38%) remained anaemic at 12 months and 29/76 (38%) at 24 months of follow-up. The correlation to the PCDAI disappeared. At 24 months, children were more likely to be anaemic. There was no difference in iron dose nor duration of iron supplements between children and adolescents. Iron treatment was more readily given to patients presenting with anaemia. Hb did not differ between patients with (n = 28) or without iron supplements. Half of the patients with persisting anaemia were given iron supplements, of which, only three were given intravenously. CONCLUSION: Anaemia remains an important extra-intestinal manifestation of CD in children. Physicians, lacking optimal treatment strategies, undertreat their patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Osteoporosis and fractures are frequently encountered in patients with Crohn's disease. In order to prevent fractures, treatment with bone protecting drugs appears warranted early in the course of bone disease when bone loss is not yet prominent. We therefore aimed to demonstrate a beneficial effect on bone density of the bisphosphonate risedronate in osteopenic Crohn's disease patients. METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial of risedronate with calcium and vitamin D supplementation was performed in osteopenic Crohn's disease patients. Patients were treated for 2 years with follow-up after 3 and after every 6 months. Disease characteristics and activity and bone turnover markers were assessed at all visits; dual x-ray absorptiometry was performed at baseline, 12 and 24 months; radiographs of the spine at baseline and 24 months. RESULTS: Of 132 consenting patients, 131 were randomised (67 placebo and 64 risedronate). Patient characteristics were similar in both groups, although the risedronate group was slightly heavier (body mass index 24.3 vs 23.0 kg/m(2)). Bone mineral density at lumbar spine increased 0.04 g/cm(2) on average in the risedronate group versus 0.01 g/cm(2) in the placebo group (p=0.007). The mean increase in total hip bone mineral density was 0.03 versus 0.01 g/cm(2), respectively (p=0.071). Fracture prevalence and incidence were similar. Change of T-scores and concentrations of bone turnover markers were consistent with a beneficial effect of risedronate when compared with placebo. The effect of risedronate was primarily demonstrated in the first 12 months of treatment. No serious unexpected suspected adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A 24-month treatment course with risedronate 35 mg once weekly, concomitant with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, in osteopenic Crohn's disease patients improved bone density at lumbar spine.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2007, leading international experts in the field of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) recommended intravenous (IV) iron supplements over oral (PO) ones because of superior effectiveness and better tolerance. We aimed to determine the percentage of patients with IBD undergoing iron therapy and to assess the dynamics of iron prescription habits (IV versus PO). METHODS: We analyzed anonymized data on patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis extracted from the Helsana database. Helsana is a Swiss health insurance company providing coverage for 18% of the Swiss population (1.2 million individuals). RESULTS: In total, 629 patients with Crohn's disease (61% female) and 398 patients with ulcerative colitis (57% female) were identified; mean observation time was 31.8 months for Crohn's disease and 31.0 months for ulcerative colitis patients. Of all patients with IBD, 27.1% were prescribed iron (21.1% in males; 31.1% in females). Patients treated with steroids, immunomodulators, and/or anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs were more frequently treated with iron supplements when compared with those not treated with any medications (35.0% versus 20.9%, odds ratio, 1.94; P < 0.001). The frequency of IV iron prescriptions increased significantly from 2006 to 2009 for both genders (males: from 2.6% to 10.1%, odds ratio = 3.84, P < 0.001; females: from 5.3% to 12.1%, odds ratio = 2.26, P = 0.002), whereas the percentage of PO iron prescriptions did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-seven percent of patients with IBD were treated with iron supplements. Iron supplements administered IV were prescribed more frequently over time. These prescription habits are consistent with the implementation of guidelines on the management of iron deficiency in IBD.},

   abstract = {Curcumin belongs to the family of natural compounds collectively called curcuminoids and it possesses remarkable beneficial anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and neuroprotective properties. Moreover it is commonly assumed that curcumin has also been suggested as a remedy for digestive diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), a chronic immune disorder affecting the gastrointestinal tract and that can be divided in two major subgroups: Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), depending mainly on the intestine tract affected by the inflammatory events. The chronic and intermittent nature of IBD imposes, where applicable, long-term treatments conducted in most of the cases combining different types of drugs. In more severe cases and where there has been no good response to the drugs, a surgery therapy is carried out. Currently, IBD-pharmacological treatments are generally not curative and often present serious side effects; for this reason, being known the relationship between nutrition and IBD, it is worthy of interesting the study and the development of new dietary strategy. The curcumin principal mechanism is the suppression of IBD inflammatory compounds (NF-kappaB) modulating immune response. This review summarizes literature data of curcumin as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant in IBD, trying to understand the different effects in CD e UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Osteopenia and increased risk for fractures in IBD result from several factors. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the dietary intake of calcium in IBD patients. METHODS: A 22-item quantitative validated frequency food questionnaire was used for quantifying dietary calcium in relation to gender and age, in 187 IBD patients, 420 normal- and 276 diseased controls. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Mann-Whitney, chi-square- and T-tests. RESULTS: The mean calcium intake was 991.0 +/- 536.0 (105.8% Recommended Daily Allowances) and 867.6 +/- 562.7 SD mg/day (93.8% RDA) in healthy and diseased controls, and 837.8 +/- 482.0 SD mg/day (92.7% RDA) in IBD, P<0.001. Calcium intake was high in celiac disease (1165.7 +/- 798.8 SD mg/day, 120% RDA), and non-significantly lower in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease (798.7 +/- 544.1 SD mg/day vs 881.9 +/- 433.0). CD and UC females, but not males, had a mean calcium intake well under RDA. In all study groups the intake was lower in patients believing that consumption of lactose-containing food induced symptoms, versus those who did not (105.8% vs 114.3% RDA in normal controls; 100.4% vs 87.6% RDA in IBD). CONCLUSIONS: Diet in IBD patients contained significantly less calcium than in healthy controls. Gender and age, more than diagnosis, are central in determining inadequate calcium intake, more so in IBD. Self-reported lactose intolerance, leading to dietary restrictions, is the single major determinant of low calcium intake. Inadequate calcium intake is present in one third of IBD patients and represents a reversible risk factor for osteoporosis, suggesting the need for tailored nutritional advice in IBD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are two distinct conditions triggered by the ingestion of gliadin. Although symptoms of nonceliac gluten sensitivity may resemble those of celiac disease, due to the lack of objective diagnostic tests, NCGS is associated with overlapping symptomatologies of autoimmunities and Crohn's disease. Furthermore, a gluten-free diet is only recommended for those who meet the criteria for a diagnosis of CD. Unfortunately, that leaves many nonceliac gluten-sensitive people suffering unnecessarily from very serious symptoms that put them at risk for complications of autoimmune disorders that might be resolved with a gluten-free diet. Thus, a new paradigm is needed for aid in diagnosing and distinguishing among various gut-related diseases, including CD, NCGS (also known as silent celiac disease), and gut-related autoimmunities. Herein, we report three different cases: the first, an elderly patient with celiac disease which was diagnosed based on signs and symptoms of malabsorption and by a proper lab test; second, a case of NCGS which was initially misdiagnosed as lupus but was detected as NCGS by a proper lab test with its associated autoimmunities, including gluten ataxia and neuromyelitis optica; third, a patient with NCGS overlapping with Crohn's disease. The symptomatologies of all three patients improved significantly after 12 months of gluten-free diet plus other modalities.},

We examined the outcomes of consecutively performed laparoscopic-assisted ileocecectomy for Crohn's disease (CD), with particular focus on FT's effects in patients with underlying bowel inflammation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing isolated laparoscopic-assisted ileocecectomy for CD at our institution between 12/2000 and 12/2010, excluding patients with multiple areas of surgical CD, bladder involvement, or age >18years. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients aged 8-18years underwent isolated laparoscopic-assisted ileocecectomy for CD, of which 45 met FT criteria. Individual practice patterns primarily determined which patients were FT-managed. FT management led to decreased length of stay (LOS), time to first stool, time to full diet, and intravenous narcotic use. No significant difference in complications or disease progression was observed between the two groups during 2-year follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that FT is safe and effective in patients with CD. In a chronically ill population, counseling patients and families to expect early discharge is critical to the success of this strategy. Despite CD-related GI pathology, FT patients realized benefits in terms of LOS, time to bowel function, and narcotic use without any increase in complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enteral nutrition is used to treat a subset of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. Because dietary factors may contribute to an aggressive immune response toward the intestinal microbiota in the disease susceptible host, we used TNFDeltaARE/WT mice to study the therapeutic effect of a semisynthetic experimental diet in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD)-like inflammation in the ileum. METHODS: TNFDeltaARE/WT mice were fed chow and experimental diets partially fortified with gluten in a dose and time-dependent manner. Histopathology, markers of inflammation, intraepithelial lymphocytes phenotypes, and antigen-specific reactivation of CD4(+) T cells were determined. RESULTS: TNFDeltaARE/WT mice being transferred to an experimental diet with 7 but not with 10 or 14 weeks of age were protected from development of Crohn's disease-like ileitis. Although disease-related CD8alphabeta(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes were increased irrespective of dietary intervention, the protective effect of experimental diet was associated with decreased expression of inflammation markers in ileal tissues. In addition, CD4(+) T-cell reactivation in bacterial antigen-primed dendritic cell cocultures was not altered between semisynthetic and chow diet-fed TNFDeltaARE/WT mice, suggesting bacteria-independent mechanisms. Most importantly, gluten-fortified experimental diet induced chronic ileitis in TNFDeltaARE/WT mice, despite the fact that gluten-derived peptides failed to induce CD4(+) T-cell activation. Reduced occludin expression levels suggest a negative role of gluten-fortified experimental diet on intestinal barrier integrity. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease-like ileitis can be prevented at early stages of disease development using a semisynthetic experimental diet. Gluten was identified as antigen-independent dietary factor relevant for the induction of chronic inflammation in the small intestine of TNFDeltaARE/WT mice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary fiber may favorably influence fermentation, gastrointestinal inflammation, and disease progression in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and pouchitis and offer an attractive therapeutic addition to pharmacological treatment. This systematic review appraised data from randomized controlled trials of fiber in the management of inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The review followed Cochrane and PRISMA recommendations. Seven electronic databases were searched along with hand searching and contacting experts. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of the effects of fiber on clinical endpoints (primarily disease activity for treatment or maintenance) or physiological outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: In total, 23 randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria (UC, 10; Crohn's disease, 12; and pouchitis, 1) recruiting 1296 patients. In UC, 3/10 studies reported fiber supplementation to benefit disease outcomes. In Crohn's disease, 0/12 studies and in pouchitis 1/1 study reported a benefit on disease activity. Despite this, a number of studies reported favorable intragroup effects on physiological outcomes including fecal butyrate, fecal calprotectin, inflammatory cytokines, microbiota, and gastrointestinal symptom indices. Meta-analysis was not possible. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited weak evidence for the efficacy of fiber in improving disease outcomes in UC and pouchitis. The potential antiinflammatory role of fiber is intriguing and merits further investigation in adequately powered clinical trials. Excluding overt gastrointestinal obstruction, there was no evidence that fiber intake should be restricted in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

The aim of this article is to review the emerging evidence for the mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is strongly influenced by factors including age, diet and disease. Probiotics may be effective through their impact on the host gastrointestinal microbiota and promotion of mucosal immunoregulation. Probiotics are considered to be well tolerated, although the quality of studies and health claims has been variable. There are many short-term studies demonstrating the effectiveness of probiotics in IBS, although recommendations should be made for specific strains and for specific symptoms. Within IBD, a number of trials have shown the benefits of a range of probiotics in pouchitis and in ulcerative colitis, although current evidence in Crohn's disease is less promising. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics have considerable potential in the management of IBS and IBD; however, the benefits are strain specific. High-quality trials of probiotics in gastrointestinal disorders as well as laboratory investigations of their mechanism of action are required in order to understand who responds and why.},

The aim of the study was the evaluation of lactase, saccharase, and maltase activity in patients with IBD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study comprised 65 children, aged 3-18 years. During a routine endoscopy, we took biopsies from the descending part of the duodenum. In these biopsies, we determined disaccharidase activity using Dahlquist's method. RESULTS: Decreased lactase activity in the biopsies taken from the small intestine mucosa was most frequently observed in patients with Crohn's disease (5/15-33%) and least frequently seen in children with lymphocytic colitis (in 1/10-10%). The lowest mean values of lactase activity were found in the children with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (1.7-2.5 U/1 g). Decreased saccharase activity in the biopsies obtained from the small intestine mucosa was most frequently observed in patients with lymphocytic colitis (in 5/10-50%) and ulcerative colitis (9/20-45%) and least frequently seen in children with non-specific undetermined colitis (in 7/20-35%). Decreased maltase activity in the small bowel mucosa was the most frequently observed in patients with Crohn's disease (in 5/15-33%) and least frequently seen in children with ulcerative colitis (in 3/20-15%). The lowest mean values of maltase activity were found in the children with Crohn's disease (5.4 U/1 g). CONCLUSION: Therefore, it seems reasonable to perform diagnostic examinations aimed at lactose, saccharose, and maltose intolerance and to initiate a dietary regimen in children with IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess vitamin D status of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and to compare their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (s-25OHD) with established cutoffs and assess whether 6 months of supplementation with 2000 IU/d, vs 400 IU/d, would reduce the group prevalence of vitamin D below these cutoffs. STUDY DESIGN: Subjects 8-18 years (n = 83) with quiescent CD were randomized to either 400 or 2000 IU vitamin D3/d for 6 months. RESULTS: Baseline mean +/- SD s-25OHD was 24 +/- 8 ng/mL; 13 subjects (16%) had an s-25OHD <16 ng/mL, 27 (33%) < 20 ng/mL, and 65 (79%) < 30 ng/mL. There was no significant difference between groups in achieving the cutoffs of 16 ng/mL or 20 ng/mL at 6 months; however, only 35% of the 400 IU group achieved the greater cutoff of 30 ng/mL compared with 74% in the 2000 IU group (P < .001). Baseline adjusted mean s-25OHD concentrations at 6 months were 9.6 ng/mL (95% CI 6.0-13.2, P < .001) greater in the 2000 IU than the 400 IU group. Disease activity was not affected by supplement dose. Few subjects exceeded safety marker cutoffs, and this did not differ by dose. CONCLUSIONS: At baseline, a high proportion of patients had a mean s-25OHD >20 ng/mL. 2000 IU vitamin D3/d is more effective in raising s-25OHD concentrations to > 30 ng/mL in children with CD than 400 IU/d, but both treatments were equally effective at achieving 16 or 20 ng/mL.},

   abstract = {The human gut contains a vast number of microorganisms known collectively as the gut microbiota. Despite its importance in maintaining the health of the host, growing evidence suggests the gut microbiota may also be an important factor in the pathogenesis of various diseases, a number of which have shown a rapid increase in incidence over the past few decades. In some of these diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the microbiota is dysbiotic with an abnormal community structure and decrease in diversity. If the dysbiotic microbiota plays a role in disease pathogenesis, interventions that modify its composition to make it more similar to the microbiota observed in health, might be a strategy to treat certain disease processes. Indeed, the high-level efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of refractory Clostridia difficile infection supports this notion as proof-of-principle. The composition of the microbiota can be influenced by many factors including age, genetics, host environment, and diet. With respect to the later, diet has an impact upon both the composition and function of the microbiota. There are epidemiologic data associating diet with the development of IBD as well as evidence that diet can influence both the form and function of the microbiome in a manner that impacts upon the development of intestinal inflammation. Based on this evidence, studies are now underway to examine the effect of defined formula diets, an effective therapeutic modality in Crohn's disease, on both the gut microbiome and its metabolome as a therapeutic probe with the hope of better defining the 'healthy' diet in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {It is widely established that a high-protein fishmeal supplemented starter diet and Eimeria infection can predispose birds to the development of clinical necrotic enteritis symptoms following Clostridium perfringens infection. However, it has not been clearly established what changes these treatments cause to predispose birds to succumb to necrotic enteritis. We analysed caecal microbiota of 4 groups of broilers (n=12) using deep pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons: (1) control chicks fed a control diet, (2) Eimeria infected chicks fed control diet, (3) chicks fed fishmeal supplemented diet and lastly (4) both fishmeal fed and Eimeria infected chicks. We found that the high-protein fishmeal diet had a strong effect on the intestinal microbiota similar to the previously reported effect of C. perfringens infection. We noted major changes in the prevalence of various lactobacilli while the total culturable Lactobacillus counts remained stable. The Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, unknown Clostridiales and Lactobacillaceae families were most affected by fishmeal with increases in a number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that had previously been linked to Crohn's disease and reductions in OTUs known to be butyrate producers. Eimeria induced very different changes in microbiota; Ruminococcaceae groups were reduced in number and three unknown Clostridium species were increased in abundance. Additionally, Eimeria did not significantly influence changes in pH, formic, propionic or isobutyric acid while fishmeal induced dramatic changes in all these measures. Both fishmeal feeding and Eimeria infection induced significant changes in the gut microbiota; these changes may play an important role in predisposing birds to necrotic enteritis.},

   abstract = {The peptide transporter PEPT1, expressed in the brush border membrane of enterocytes, mediates the uptake of di- and tripeptides from luminal protein digestion in the small intestine. PEPT1 was proposed not to be expressed in normal colonic mucosa but may become detectable in inflammatory states such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. We reassessed colonic expression of PEPT1 by performing a systematic analysis of PEPT1 mRNA and protein levels in healthy colonic tissues in mice, rats, and humans. Immunofluorescence analysis of different mouse strains (C57BL/6N, 129/Sv, BALB/c) demonstrated the presence of PEPT1 in the distal part of the colon but not in proximal colon. Rat and human intestines display a similar distribution of PEPT1 as found in mice. However, localization in human sigmoid colon revealed immunoreactivity present at low levels in apical membranes but substantial staining in distinct intracellular compartments. Functional activity of PEPT1 in colonic tissues from mice was assessed in everted sac preparations using [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar and found to be 5.7-fold higher in distal compared with proximal colon. In intestinal tissues from Pept1-/- mice, no [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar transport was detectable but feces samples revealed significantly higher water content than in wild-type mice, suggesting that PEPT1 contributes to colonic water absorption. In conclusion, our studies unequivocally demonstrate the presence of PEPT1 protein in healthy distal colonic epithelium in mice, rats, and humans and proved that the protein is functional and contributes to electrolyte and water handling in mice.},

The role of dietary interventions and enteral nutrition in the management of IBD remains unelucidated. This study was to review the current evidence for dietary risk factors for the development of IBD and the efficacies of dietary and enteral interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: High dietary intakes of total fats, polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat are associated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Further prospective studies are required to confirm these observations. Among various dietary interventions, none has shown striking efficacy. Meta-analyses have shown enteral nutrition to be inferior to corticosteroids in adults with active Crohn's disease. However, in children, a meta-analysis has shown no significant difference in the remission rates between enteral nutrition and corticosteroid therapy. Although the evidence level is not striking, enteral nutrition may be useful for maintaining remission in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease. SUMMARY: Dietary risk factors for IBD and the therapeutic benefit of dietary and enteral interventions need to be confirmed by further well designed studies in large cohorts of patients.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effect of enteral nutrition (EN) as a maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) patients following surgery. METHODS: This study was an extension of our previous study to prolong the duration of intervention and follow-up from 1 to 5 years. Forty consecutive patients who underwent resection for ileal or ileocolic CD were included. Following surgery, 20 patients received continuous elemental diet infusion during the nighttime plus a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group). Another 20 patients received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (control group). All patients were followed for 5 years after operation. No patient received corticosteroid, immunosuppressants, or infliximab except patients who developed recurrence. The end point of this study was recurrence requiring biologic therapy or reoperation. Recurrence rates were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: In the EN group, four patients could not continue tube intubation for elemental diet intake. Two patients (10 %) in the EN group and nine patients (45 %) in the control group developed recurrence requiring infliximab therapy (P = 0.03). The cumulative recurrence incidence rate requiring infliximab was significantly lower in the EN group vs the control group (P = 0.02). One patient (5 %) in the EN group and five patients (25 %) in the control group required reoperation for recurrence (P = 0.18). The cumulative incidence of reoperation was lower in the EN group vs the control group, the difference not being significant (P = 0.08). CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this study suggest that EN therapy reduces the incidence of postoperative CD recurrence.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Low vitamin D status may be associated with Crohn's disease. A pilot study was performed in patients with mild-to-moderate Crohn's disease to determine the dose of vitamin D needed to raise serum vitamin D levels above 40 ng/ml. METHODS: Patients were evaluated for severity of symptoms using the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and patients with mild-to-moderate (150-400 CDAI scores) Crohn's disease were entered into the study (n=18). Vitamin D3 oral therapy was initiated at 1,000 IU/d and after 2 weeks, the dose was escalated incrementally until patients' serum concentrations reached 40 ng/ml 25(OH)D3 or they were taking 5,000 IU/d. Patients continued on the vitamin D supplements for 24 weeks. CDAI, quality of life measures, bone mineral density, dietary analyses, cytokines, parathyroid hormone, calcium, and several other laboratory measurements were evaluated at baseline and after 24 weeks supplementation. RESULTS: Fourteen of eighteen patients required the maximal vitamin D supplement of 5,000 IU/d. Vitamin D oral supplementation significantly increased serum 25(OH)D3 levels from 16+/-10 ng/ml to 45+/-19 ng/ml (P<0.0001) and reduced the unadjusted mean CDAI scores by 112+/-81 points from 230+/-74 to 118+/-66 (P<0.0001). Quality-of-life scores also improved following vitamin D supplementation (P=0.0004). No significant changes in cytokine or other laboratory measures were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-four weeks supplementation with up to 5,000 IU/d vitamin D3 effectively raised serum 25(OH)D3 and reduced CDAI scores in a small cohort of Crohn's patients suggesting that restoration of normal vitamin D serum levels may be useful in the management of patients with mild-moderate Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, which includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are at a significantly increased risk of developing colorectal cancer, and aberrant interleukin (IL)-6/STAT3 signaling pathway exists in both inflammatory bowel disease and inflammation-related gastrointestinal cancers. We have previously found that oroxylin A inhibited the NF-kappaB signaling in human colon tumor HCT-116 cells. However, whether oroxylin A could inhibit the colitis-associated carcinogenesis remains to be determined. METHODS: HCT-116 cells were treated with various concentrations of oroxylin A. Expression of relative proteins of IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway was assayed by Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis. Mouse model for colitis-associated colorectal cancer was induced by a combined treatment with 10 mg/kg azoxymethane (AOM) followed by 3 cycles of 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate in C57BL/6 mice. IL-6 and IL-1beta gene expression were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of relative proteins was examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. RESULTS: Oroxylin A effectively inhibited IL-6/STAT3 pathway in human HCT-116 cells, and the effect of oroxylin A was reversible. Dietary administration of oroxylin A throughout the experimental period significantly reduced the tumor burden, inhibited cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis in colon carcinomas. The expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1beta decreased in tumors in oroxylin A-treated mice. The IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway was attenuated in oroxylin A-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that oroxylin A inhibits colitis-associated carcinogenesis through modulating IL-6/STAT3 pathway in AOM/dextran sodium sulfate mouse model and in HCT-116 cells.},

   abstract = {Omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have well documented anti-inflammatory properties, and consequently therapeutic potential in chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we discuss the effects of n-3 PUFAs on various inflammatory pathways and how this leads to alterations in the function of inflammatory cells, most importantly endothelial cells and leukocytes. Strong evidence indicates n-3 PUFAs are beneficial as a dietary supplement in certain diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis; however for other conditions such as asthma, the data are less robust. A clearer understanding of the pharmacology of n-3 PUFAs will help to establish targets to modulate chronic inflammatory diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: 5-Aminosalicylates (ASA) are widely used in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Nephrotoxicity has been described in some IBD patients treated with 5-ASA. Whether physicians managing these patients are monitoring renal function in daily practice is unknown. The aims of this paper were to investigate how private gastroenterologists monitor renal function and manage renal failure in IBD patients treated with oral 5-ASA therapy. METHODS: This was a web-based cross sectional national survey which was conducted among private gastroenterologists. RESULTS: A total of 249 practitioners completed the survey. Eighty two percent (n=205) of responders declared that they always monitor renal function. The respondents monitored twice a year Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) [90% (n=225)] and Creatinine Clearance (CCr) using a 24-hour urine collection [51% (n=126)]. Blood electrolytes, 24-hour urinary protein rate and dipsticks are performed by 41%, 39% and 22% of practitioners, respectively. Before oral 5-ASA initiation, 59% (n=148) of respondents screen for renal failure. In case of elevated serum creatinine, a nephrologist's opinion is asked by 80% (n=200) of responders and by 76% (n=189) of respondents before treatment initiation. CONCLUSIONS: Most gastroenterologists are monitoring renal function once or twice a year in IBD patients on 5-ASA. Less than two thirds of them screen for renal failure before treatment initiation. MDRD is mainly used, but a wide range of parameters is evaluated.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence supports an immunologic role for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here we examined if pretreatment vitamin D status influences durability of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: All IBD patients who had plasma 25(OH)D level checked <3 months prior to initiating anti-TNF-alpha therapy were included in this retrospective single-center cohort study. Our main predictor variable was insufficient plasma 25(OH)D (<30 ng/mL). Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for potential confounders was used to identify the independent effect of pretreatment vitamin D on biologic treatment cessation. RESULTS: Our study included 101 IBD patients (74 CD; median disease duration 9 years). The median index 25(OH)D level was 27 ng/mL (interquartile range, 20-33 ng/mL). One-third of the patients had prior exposure to anti-TNF-alpha therapy. On multivariate analysis, patients with insufficient vitamin D demonstrated earlier cessation of anti-TNF-alpha therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-4.39; P = .04). This effect was significant in patients who stopped treatment for loss of response (HR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.34-9.09) and stronger for CD (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 0.95-5.99) than UC (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that vitamin D levels may influence durability of anti-TNF-alpha induction and maintenance therapy. Larger cohort studies and clinical trials of supplemental vitamin D use with disease activity as an end point may be warranted.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most commonly ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Patients affected with IBD experience symptoms including abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and weight loss. There is no cure for IBD; thus treatments typically focus on preventing complications, inducing and maintaining remission, and improving quality of life. During IBD, dysregulation of the intestinal immune system leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, and recruitment of activated immune cells to the intestine, causing tissue damage and perpetuating the inflammatory response. Recent biological therapies targeting specific inflammatory cytokines or pathways, in particular TNF-alpha, have shown promise, but not all patients respond to treatment, and some individuals become intolerant to treatment over time. Dietary peptides and amino acids (AAs) have been shown to modulate intestinal immune functions and influence inflammatory responses, and may be useful as alternative or ancillary treatments in IBD. This review focuses on dietary interventions for IBD treatment, in particular the role of dietary peptides and AAs in reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the gut, as well as recent advances in the cellular mechanisms responsible for their anti-inflammatory activity.},
