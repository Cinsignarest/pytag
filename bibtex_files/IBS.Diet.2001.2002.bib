   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Nonresponse or relapse of symptoms is common in patients with celiac disease treated with gluten free diet. Refractory sprue (RS) is defined as initial or subsequent failure of a strict gluten-free diet to restore normal intestinal architecture and function in patients who have celiac-like enteropathy. The aims of this study were: 1) to identify causes of persistent symptoms in patients referred with presumed diagnosis of nonresponsive celiac disease (NCD); and 2) to characterize patients with true RS. METHODS: Patients were identified who had been systematically evaluated for NCD between January 1997, and May 2001. Patient records and small bowel biopsy results were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were referred with a presumed diagnosis of NCD. Six did not have celiac disease and had other diseases responsible for their symptoms. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss were the most common reasons for evaluation in cases of NCD, whereas weight loss, steatorrhea, and diarrhea were the most common presenting features of RS (nine patients). Of the 49 patients with celiac disease, 25 were identified as having gluten contamination. Additional diagnoses accounting for persistent symptoms included: pancreatic insufficiency, irritable bowel syndrome, bacterial overgrowth, lymphocytic colitis, collagenous colitis, ulcerative jejunitis, T-cell lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, fructose intolerance, protein losing enteropathy, cavitating lymphadenopathy syndrome, and tropical sprue. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, we conclude the following: 1) gluten contamination is the leading reason for NCD; 2) of NCD cases, 18% are due to RS; and 3) alternative diseases or those coexistent with celiac disease and gluten contamination should be ruled out before a diagnosis of RS is made.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) comprises a major proportion of gastrointestinal and primary care practice worldwide. The past several years have seen the rapid evolution of a new and comprehensive model of IBS based on alterations in brain-gut interactions. Alterations in the bidirectional communication between the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system are implicated in the pathogenesis of IBS. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin), a major neurotransmitter in the gastrointestinal tract, and its receptors 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 are involved in the control of gastrointestinal function. A number of abnormal motor and sensory patterns have been reported in patients with IBS. However, it is not known whether these abnormalities are related to symptoms or have a role in establishing a diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Visceral hyperalgesia in IBS patients can be secondary to altered receptor sensitivity at the viscus itself and altered central modulation of sensation involving psychological influences in the interpretation of these sensations. The development of diagnostic criteria for IBS helps to avoid unnecessary and costly investigations. A detailed history allows us to diagnose IBS and search for another cause if warning symptoms are present. The Rome criteria are presently used to define IBS and are currently the most widely applied criteria used in clinical diagnosis and research purposes. Abdominal pain or discomfort associated with chronic altered bowel habits are the mainstay in diagnosis, while the supportive criteria may be used to further classify IBS patients into diarrhea-predominant or constipation-predominant subgroups. Minimal diagnostic tests have been advocated in the initial diagnostic approach to patients with suspected IBS, depending on the predominant symptom. The therapeutic goals in IBS must focus on the overall well-being of the patient, including abdominal symptoms and the accompanying nonbowel symptoms and affective disorders. It is important to establish an effective physician-patient relationship and to reassure the patient once the diagnosis of IBS is made. Dietary modification may be of value in some patients with IBS. Dietary fiber is frequently recommended for patients with constipation-predominant IBS. Two novel serotonin agonists are currently under development for constipated IBS patients, tegaserod and prucalopride. Antidiarrheal agents, including loperamide and diphenoxylate, may help patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists may play a role in the management of such patients in the future. Psychological treatment and antidepressants should be considered when IBS symptoms are severe or refractory or associated with psychological distress and impaired quality of life.},

Tegaserod enhances gastric motility, stimulates peristaltic reflux and intestinal secretion, inhibits visceral sensitivity, and/or shortens colonic transit time. This agent may help women who have failed to respond to diet and exercise, laxatives, and other forms of therapy. The optimal dose of tegaserod is 6 mg twice daily and results in decreased number of days per month with pain, bloating, and days without bowel movements. Tegaserod is less effective in males than females in the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Tegaserod is well tolerated. Diarrhea is the most frequent adverse effect. The diarrhea tends to occur most frequently during the first few months of therapy and decreases with continued administration.},

This syndrome is attributed to disordered colonic motor function. The disorder spans a spectrum of variable severity, ranging from patients who have relatively mild delays in transit but are otherwise indistinguishable from irritable bowel syndrome to patients with colonic inertia or chronic megacolon. The diagnosis is made after excluding colonic obstruction, metabolic disorders (hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia), drug-induced constipation, and pelvic floor dysfunction (as discussed by Wald ). Most patients are treated with one or more pharmacologic agents, including dietary fiber supplementation, saline laxatives (milk of magnesia), osmotic agents (lactulose, sorbitol, and polyethylene glycol 3350), and stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl and glycerol). A subtotal colectomy is effective and occasionally is indicated for patients with medically refractory, severe slow-transit constipation, provided pelvic floor dysfunction has been excluded or treated.},

   abstract = {DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospectively, the effect of a lactose-restricted diet was evaluated among irritable bowel syndrome patients with lactose malabsorption. Lactose malabsorption was defined by a positive hydrogen breath test and a positive blood-glucose test. An analysis of symptoms was completed before, during, 6 weeks after and 5 years after starting the diet. In addition, the number of visits made by the patients to the outpatient clinic was scored during 6 years. RESULTS: In 17 out of 70 irritable bowel syndrome patients (24.3%), lactose malabsorption was detected. There was no difference in the symptom score between patients with a positive lactose tolerance test and patients with a negative lactose tolerance test. After 6 weeks of the lactose-restricted diet, symptoms were markedly improved in lactose malabsorption-positive patients (P < 0.001). After 5 years, one patient was lost for follow-up, and 14 out of the remaining 16 lactose malabsorption patients (87.5%) still had no complaints during the lactose-restricted diet. Two patients chose not to follow the diet continuously and accepted the discomfort caused by lactose intake. Only two out of 16 patients (12.5%) no longer experienced any benefit from lactose restriction. In the 5 years before their diagnosis of lactose malabsorption, these 16 patients visited the outpatient clinic a total of 192 times (mean 2.4 visits per year per person; range 1-7 visits). In the 5 years after diagnosis, they visited the outpatient clinic a total of 45 times (mean 0.6 visits per year per person; range 0-6 visits; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In a large majority of irritable bowel syndrome patients with lactose malabsorption, which was previously clinically unrecognized, a lactose-restricted diet improved symptoms markedly both in the short term and the long term. Furthermore, visits by all patients to the outpatient clinic were reduced by 75%. We conclude that diet therapy is extremely cost- and time-saving. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that lactose malabsorption, which is easily treatable, is excluded before diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a debilitating disease, which is characterised by recurrent abdominal cramping and pain, and is associated with either constipation and/or diarrhoea. It is approximately twice as prevalent in women as it is in men and is among the most common gastrointestinal (GI) disorders encountered in primary care. The aetiology of the disease is poorly understood but may include motility dysregulation, visceral sensitivity, inflammation, bacterial infection, dietary antigens, psychological stress, GI surgery or a gut-brain phenomenon. At present, there is no acceptable treatment for IBS, although recent advances indicate that some relief may be achieved by the administration of compounds that act on 5-HT (serotonin) receptors. This suggestion is the result of numerous studies which have shown that 5-HT may exert a number of diverse effects on human GI tissues. In addition, it has emerged that the levels of the 5-HT metabolite (5-HIAA) are raised in the plasma of IBS patients and that administration of 5-HT-like compounds may mimic the symptoms of IBS. It has therefore been proposed that therapy with compounds that act at 5-HT receptors will return the intestine to normal activity and alleviate the pain experienced by these patients. One compound (alosetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist) has already been released onto the market but showed benefit in female patients only and only in those whose primary symptom was diarrhoea. In addition, the compound was recently withdrawn following concerns over its safety. The reasons why alosetron only appears to show efficacy in females, why these treatments are only effective in a subset of the population of IBS patients and why alosetron elicits its particular side effect profile have not been elucidated. One further serotonergic compound, tegaserod (Zelmac, a 5-HT4 receptor agonist), has shown promise for the treatment of patients with constipation-predominant IBS and is currently in pre-registration for this indication. It is clear, however, that further research will have to take place before the utility of serotonergic modulation in the treatment of IBS can be fully validated.},

   abstract = {The aim of this literature review is to produce guidelines for dietetic practice in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by evaluating the research available. In this area randomized control trials (RCT) only account for a small proportion of the literature and have been concentrated in the modification of dietary fibre in patients with IBS. The bulk of the literature is mainly observational trials from which no indisputable conclusions can be extracted. In this review, the evidence available has been interpreted within the context of the current knowledge base. Conclusions are drawn to facilitate the development of guidelines, enabling a starting point for discussion and an evaluation of current practice. The literature available on therapeutic dietary manipulation in IBS patients is centred around non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs), mono and disaccharide sensitivity and food intolerance. The production of these guidelines has focused on research examining the role of dietary components in the therapeutic management of patients with IBS. However, where there is a deficiency in the literature directly relating dietary intake to management of IBS patients, physiological function in relation to dietary components has been relied upon to produce practical guidelines which can be applied realistically in a clinical environment. An interpretation of the evidence has revealed a limited role for exclusion diets, a move away from high-fibre diets towards the manipulation of fibre fractions in the diet, an evaluation of the effects of caffeine on gut function and the necessity for individual dietary assessment to identify dietary issues pertinent to the patient's symptoms. These guidelines outline a positive role for dietitians in the treatment of IBS patients which draws on the unique skills possessed by dietitians regarding the assessment of habitual eating habits and therapeutic dietary manipulation.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common disorder diagnosed by gastroenterologists and one of the more common ones encountered in general practice. The overall prevalence rate is similar (approximately 10%) in most industrialized countries; the illness has a large economic impact on health care use and indirect costs, chiefly through absenteeism. IBS is a biopsychosocial disorder in which 3 major mechanisms interact: psychosocial factors, altered motility, and/or heightened sensory function of the intestine. Subtle inflammatory changes suggest a role for inflammation, especially after infectious enteritis, but this has not yet resulted in changes in the approach to patient treatment. Treatment of patients is based on positive diagnosis of the symptom complex, limited exclusion of underlying organic disease, and institution of a therapeutic trial. If patient symptoms are intractable, further investigations are needed to exclude specific motility or other disorders. Symptoms fluctuate over time; treatment is often restricted to times when patients experience symptoms. Symptomatic treatment includes supplementing fiber to achieve a total intake of up to 30 g in those with constipation, those taking loperamide or other opioids for diarrhea, and those taking low-dose antidepressants or infrequently using antispasmodics for pain. Older conventional therapies do not address pain in IBS. Behavioral psychotherapy and hypnotherapy are also being evaluated. Novel approaches include alosetron; a 5-HT(3) antagonist, tegaserod, a partial 5-HT(4) agonist, kappa-opioid agonists, and neurokinin antagonists to address the remaining challenging symptoms of pain, constipation, and bloating. Understanding the brain-gut axis is key to the eventual development of effective therapies for IBS.},

   abstract = {This consensus document reviews the current status of the epidemiology, social impact, patient quality of life, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Current evidence suggests that two major mechanisms may interact in irritable bowel syndrome: altered gastrointestinal motility and increased sensitivity of the intestine. However, other factors, such as psychosocial factors, intake of food and prior infection, may contribute to its development. Management of patients is based on a positive diagnosis of the symptom complex, careful history and physical examination to exclude 'red flags' as risk factors for organic disease, and, if indicated, investigations to exclude other disorders. Therapeutic choices include dietary fibre for constipation, opioid agents for diarrhoea and low-dose antidepressants or infrequent use of antispasmodics for pain, although the evidence basis for efficacy is limited or in some cases absent. Psychotherapy and hypnotherapy are the subject of ongoing study. Treatment should be tailored to patient needs and fears. Novel therapies are emerging, and drugs acting on serotonin receptors have proven efficacy and a scientific rationale and, if approved, should be useful in the overall management of patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Patient and physician education, early identification of psychosocial issues and better therapies are important strategies to reduce the suffering and societal cost of irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although colon dysmotility is recognized as a pathophysiological factor in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), it has not been characterized. We have investigated motility patterns in IBS patients with abdominal pain and frequent defecation or diarrhea and in healthy volunteers. METHODS: A recording catheter that had six polyvinyl tubes with infusion ports was placed in the transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon under fluoroscopy. After 2-h basal recordings, motility responses to cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) and a meal were studied for 3 h. The motility index (MI) and number of high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) in 10 IBS patients were compared with those of 10 controls. HAPCs were correlated with abdominal pain, and colon transit time using radio-opaque markers was determined. Using human colon muscle strips, the effect of CCK-8 on muscle contractions was also studied. RESULTS: The MI and mean number and peak amplitude of HAPCs in IBS patients were significantly greater than in controls. These abnormalities paralleled markedly shortened colonic transit time. Abdominal pain coincided with >90% of HAPCs. Dose-dependent muscle contraction by CCK-8 was profoundly suppressed both by loxiglumide and atropine. CONCLUSIONS: The dysmotility in this subset of IBS patients was characterized by significantly increased occurrences of powerful HAPCs that paralleled rapid colon transit and were accompanied by abdominal pain. Thus, it is suggested that this powerful contraction is one of the causes of abdominal pain. The action of CCK-8 seems to be mediated via the colon enteric nervous system.},

The aim of the study was to investigate fasting and postprandial distal colonic motility in the four groups of patients and to compare the results with normal controls. Distal colonic motility studies were performed in the unprepared colon. 2.5-hr recordings were made from four channels with a standard meal administered at 0.5 hr. The intubated colon was treated as a study segment and data analyzed for study segment activity index (SSAI) and number and mean amplitude of pressure peaks over 30-min epochs. Patients with SCS had significantly higher (P < 0.05) mean amplitude of pressure peaks (60 min, 120 min) and SSAI (120 min) than controls and patients with FD, DPSCS, and MGD. In contrast, patients with FD and DPSCS had significantly (P < 0.05) lower postprandial SSAI than controls and patients with SCS (60 min, 120 min). With the exception of raised postprandial mean amplitude of pressure peaks (120 min), MGD patients had normal distal colonic motility. Division of IBS patients into subgroups has highlighted significant differences in distal colonic motility that provide insights into etiopathogenesis and should assist targeting of current and newly developed therapies, particularly receptor active agents.},

   abstract = {Severe fatigue is a common complaint among patients. Often, the fatigue is transient or can be attributed to a definable organic illness. Some patients present with persistent and disabling fatigue, but show no abnormalities on physical examination or screening laboratory tests. In these cases, the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) should be considered. CFS is characterized by debilitating fatigue with associated myalgias, tender lymph nodes, arthralgias, chills, feverish feelings, and postexertional malaise. Diagnosis of CFS is primarily by exclusion with no definitive laboratory test or physical findings. Medical research continues to examine the many possible etiologic agents for CFS (infectious, immunologic, neurologic, and psychiatric), but the answer remains elusive. It is known that CFS is a heterogeneous disorder possibly involving an interaction of biologic systems. Similarities with fibromyalgia exist and concomitant illnesses include irritable bowel syndrome, depression, and headaches. Therefore, treatment of CFS may be variable and should be tailored to each patient. Therapy should include exercise, diet, good sleep hygiene, antidepressants, and other medications, depending on the patient's presentation.},

   abstract = {Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare gastrointestinal (GI) disorder of undetermined cause characterized by infiltration of eosinophils in the GI tract. Eosinophils accumulate in tissues and may release highly cytotoxic granular proteins, which cause severe tissue damage characteristic of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Eotaxin may play a role in the recruitment of eosinophils into tissue in combination with chemoattractants and cytokines, including interleukin 3 and 5 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Food allergy, especially in children, can be a triggering factor, and an amino acid-based diet may be helpful. Accumulation of eosinophils in the gut is a common feature in food-induced GI disorders that can be regulated through a complex molecular network involving Th2 cells, various cytokines, and chemokines. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis has a wide spectrum of clinical presentation depending on the site of involvement. It may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome or dyspepsia and, rarely, mimics pancreatitis or appendicitis. Diagnosis is important and is usually made by a pathologist. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a treatable disease; patients generally respond to steroid therapy, although relapse is common. Non-enteric-coated budesonide, a locally acting corticosteroid with little risk of adrenal suppression, may be substituted, although more experience is needed. Promising new drugs for eosinophilic gastroenteritis include montelukast, a selective leukotriene receptor antagonist, and suplaplast tosilate, a selective Th2 cytokine inhibitor with inhibitory effects on allergy-induced eosinophilic infiltration and IgE production. Although it is likely a separate disease, more experience has accumulated, and an elimination or specific amino acid-based diet appears to be helpful in treatment.},

   abstract = {Constipation is a common disorder and many patients fail to respond to the simple constipation remedies of increased fiber and fluid intake. When secondary to other conditions, medications, or disease processes, the focus of constipation management is correction of causative factors. However, primary constipation - ie, constipation with no identifiable causative factor - is very common. Patients generally present with one of three patterns: constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, slow transit constipation, or pelvic floor dysfunction resulting in dyssynergic defecation. Baseline evaluation for patients with chronic constipation includes a careful history, focused physical examination, and limited laboratory studies. Patients with dyssynergic defecation usually respond best to biofeedback therapy and pelvic muscle re-education. Constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome is best managed with dietary monitoring and modifications, fiber therapy, and education regarding self-monitoring and self-care. Patients with slow transit constipation may benefit from fiber therapy and increased activity, but most also will require laxative therapy. Current guidelines for prescribing laxatives suggest bulk agents as first line and osmotic agents as second line therapy. Stimulant laxatives should generally be reserved for PRN use. Current understanding about the etiology, pathology, and classification of different types of constipation are summarized and a stepwise approach to evaluation and management is presented.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gut disorder the diagnosis of which is based on clinical symptoms as set forth by the Rome criteria. As the population ages, especially with the population of patients >75 years of age expanding greatly over the next 10 years, IBS is becoming one of the most common diseases of the elderly. Thus far, developing treatment strategies for patients with IBS has been difficult because of the lack of pharmacological targets and the wide range of symptomatology. Additionally, demonstration of a therapeutic benefit is difficult in the presence of a high placebo response observed regardless of the therapy employed. Fibre, antidiarrhoeals and antispasmodics all play some role in the symptomatic treatment of IBS. With the evolution of IBS as a disorder of visceral hypersensitivity, new drugs have been developed that target the enteric nervous system. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been found to target the enteric neurons and play a role in pain modulation. Currently, the TCAs are recommended only for severe cases of IBS pain. The newest class of drugs to be approved for use in IBS are the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) antagonists. Specifically, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been shown to decrease symptoms in female patients with IBS. A related class of drugs, the 5-HT4 receptor agonists, is being developed for the treatment of constipation-predominant IBS. Further investigation into the role of spinal afferent neurons in visceral hypersensitivity is at the forefront of IBS research. Several experimental drug therapies for IBS are also discussed in this review including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, octreotide, clonidine and the selective M3 receptor antagonist, zamifenacin.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common condition that a physician faces in the GI clinic. Of the general population, 10 - 25% suffer from symptoms judged to be IBS. The negative impact of this disease includes not only pain, suffering and direct medical expenses but also significant social and job-related consequences. IBS can be the result of dysfunction in any part of the brain-gut axis: alterations in the CNS caused by psychological or other factors, abnormal gastrointestinal motility, or heightened visceral sensations. Diagnosis is based on either the Manning or Rome-II criteria. Education, reassurance and emotional support are the cornerstones of successful treatment. The mainstays of the current therapeutic approach continue to be: stress management strategies, dietary modification entailing addition of dietary fibre and pharmacotherapy. Pharmacotherapy is still limited to treating symptoms. Newer drugs that modulate motility or drugs that modulate visceral sensation may be useful in selected cases. Psychopharmacological agents are useful in the treatment of IBS, especially in those with psychological co-morbidity. Alternative therapies such as homeopathy, acupuncture, special diets, herbal medication and several forms of psychological treatments and hypnotherapy are sought by many patients and are now being offered by physicians as treatment options, either alone or in conjunction with conventional forms of therapy in patients with refractory symptoms.},

   abstract = {Probiotic ingestion can be recommended as a preventative approach to maintaining the balance of the intestinal microflora and thereby enhance 'well-being'. Research into the use of probiotic intervention in specific illnesses and disorders has identified certain patient populations that may benefit from the approach. Undoubtedly, probiotics will vary in their efficacy and it may not be the case that the same results occur with all species. Those that prove most efficient will likely be strains that are robust enough to survive the harsh physico-chemical conditions present in the gastrointestinal tract. This includes gastric acid, bile secretions and competition with the resident microflora. A survey of the literature indicates positive results in over fifty human trials, with prevention/treatment of infections the most frequently reported output. In theory, increased levels of probiotics may induce a 'barrier' influence against common pathogens. Mechanisms of effect are likely to include the excretion of acids (lactate, acetate), competition for nutrients and gut receptor sites, immunomodulation and the formation of specific antimicrobial agents. As such, persons susceptible to diarrhoeal infections may benefit greatly from probiotic intake. On a more chronic basis, it has been suggested that some probiotics can help maintain remission in the inflammatory conditions, ulcerative colitis and pouchitis. They have also been suggested to repress enzymes responsible for genotoxin formation. Moreover, studies have suggested that probiotics are as effective as anti-spasmodic drugs in the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome. The approach of modulating the gut flora for improved health has much relevance for the management of those with acute and chronic gut disorders. Other target groups could include those susceptible to nosocomial infections, as well as the elderly, who have an altered microflora, with a decreased number of beneficial microbial species. For the future, it is imperative that mechanistic interactions involved in probiotic supplementation be identified. Moreover, the survival issues associated with their establishment in the competitive gut ecosystem should be addressed. Here, the use of prebiotics in association with useful probiotics may be a worthwhile approach. A prebiotic is a dietary carbohydrate selectively metabolised by probiotics. Combinations of probiotics and prebiotics are known as synbiotics.},

The objective of this clinical experience was to evaluate the progress of symptoms and the modifications in the frequency of evacuation in subjects affected by IBS and regularly taking PHGG. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The group was made up of 134 out-patients of both sexes, average age 43.12, suffering from IBS, both obese and of normal weigh, with a mean number of weekly evacuations between 2 and 35. The subjects, divided in 2 groups on the basis of Body Mass Index (BMI), were submitted for 24 weeks to a balanced, low or normal calorie diet supplemented by 5 g a day of PHGG. The following information was gathered: number of weekly evacuation, typical symptoms of IBS, cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels. In a few subjects (n. = 34) also the plasmatic electrolyte levels, before and during PHGG intake, were evaluated. RESULTS: Both groups showed positive results in the evacuation frequency (p < 0.01 at 12th week) and a decrease, after 3 weeks of PHGG intake, in frequency of IBS symptoms such as flatulence (-55.6%), abdominal tension (-4.7%) and abdominal spasm (-35%). On the other hand an increased number of subjects showed normal levels of cholesterol (+12.2%), lipids (+26.9%) and glucose (+16%). Concentrations of plasmatic electrolytes didn't change during PHGG intake, except for a marked increase of selenium levels, compared to pre-intake levels. CONCLUSIONS: The observations obtained from this clinical experience reassert that dietary fiber supplementation is useful in cases of altered intestinal motility. PHGG, due to its water-solubility and non-gelling properties, can be useful also in IBS.},

Since 1987, when the first publication on the properties of the Lactobacillus GG was done, overall, there have been over 200 publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals. This paper will report the status and the prospectus of probiotics research at the beginning of the Third Millennium. Probiotics have proven benefits in treatment and prevention of rotavirus diarrhoea in children and reduction of antibiotic-associated intestinal side-effects. Interesting results have recently been published regarding food allergies and atopic eczema in children. Prevention of vaginitis and of travellers' diarrhoea have also been reported. Promising results are being reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, cystic fibrosis, dental caries and irritable bowel syndrome. It has also been suggested that probiotics could enhance oral vaccine administration, and that they may help treatment against Helicobacter pylori infection, but further studies are needed. Future areas of research regard probiotics' role in the process of carcinogenesis, given their influence on the gut microflora, and as immune modulators in autoimmune disorders. The possibility of introducing appropriate genes to the probiotics to make them produce various compounds is also under investigation. However, there is still confusion in the minds of the authorities over whether a probiotic is a drug, a food, or a dietary supplement. The challenge is to continue research to define the appropriate uses of probiotics and discover new applications which will bring benefit to humankind.},

In patients who are greatly distressed by their symptoms, an extended workup early in the course of their illness may give physician and patient confidence in focusing on IBS. The author favors a proactive, multicomponent approach to management, as it gives the physician and patient a sense of control. Treatment should include stress management, dietary advice to minimize exposure to trigger foods, and pharmacotherapy to alleviate anxiety and target disturbed physiology.},

The pathogenesis of IBS is multifactorial, involving abnormalities in the gut, immune system, enteric sensory and motor nerves, and the CNS. IBS is diagnosed by symptomatology according to the Rome criteria and the absence of alarm findings suggestive of organic disease. Minimal testing is advocated to confirm the diagnosis in patients presenting with typical symptoms. Therapy is based on the dominant symptom (IBS subtype). Therapeutic options include dietary modifications, counseling, medications, and psychologic treatments. Novel therapies are being investigated to correct potentially pathogenetic peripheral and CNS abnormalities in IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Bloating is an important but poorly understood symptom in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that is often aggravated by bran. The aim of our study was to determine whether IBS patients with bloating responded to bran differently from healthy controls. METHODS: A total of 12 patients with IBS (according to Rome I criteria), all with moderate to severe bloating, and 12 healthy controls participated in a two way, double blind, randomized, cross-over trial of bran versus placebo (crushed biscuits) 15 g b.i.d. An average daily pain index and bloating score were derived from daily symptom diaries. On day 14, gastric emptying, small bowel transit, percent remaining in ascending colon, and geometric center of a meal marker at 24 h were calculated from scintigraphic images obtained after ingesting a Tc99m-labeled rice pudding meal with 15 g of either placebo or coarse bran. RESULTS: Results are given as median (range). Bran significantly increased the pain index and bloating (p < 0.02) in IBS patients but not controls. The most striking finding was that the small bowel transit time of the meal without bran was markedly faster in IBS patients than in controls, being 203 min (range 109-313) versus 367 min (219-543), p < 0.001. Although in controls bran accelerated small bowel transit time to 262 min (180-380), p = 0.03, and significantly reduced % remaining in the ascending colon from 22% (0-46) to 3% (0-25), p = 0.03, this was not seen in the IBS patients. Bran accelerated whole gut transit as assessed by geometric center at 24 h in both IBS patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Bran accelerates small bowel transit and ascending colon clearance without causing symptoms in controls. Small bowel transit is rapid in IBS patients with bloating and, unlike in healthy control subjects, cannot be further accelerated by bran, which nevertheless aggravates symptoms of pain and bloating. We speculate that bran-induced bloating may originate in the colon rather than the small bowel.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort and abnormal defecation. Polycarbophil calcium, a water-absorbing polymer, is expected to improve stool consistency. Polycarbophil calcium decalcified under the acidic condition and then absorbed 70 times its weight of water under the neutral condition. In in situ experiments using rat jejunum and colon, polycarbophil decreased water absorption by the intestine without affecting water secretion. Polycarbophil inhibited prostaglandin E2-, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan- and castor oil-induced diarrhea in mice or rats. Polycarbophil calcium also inhibited sennoside-induced diarrhea in dogs. Polycarbophil increased the weight of feces in naive or low-fiber diet feeding rats. In naive dogs, polycarbophil calcium increased stool frequency, stool weight and moisture. Polycarbophil was not absorbed from the gastrointestine, not metabolized and eliminated into feces in rats and dogs. Polycarbophil calcium did not affect the absorption of coadministered drugs in dogs. In the dose-finding clinical study for IBS, polycarbophil calcium was effective both in diarrhea and constipation. In the Phase III study, polycarbophil calcium was superior to trimebutine maleate in efficacy and equal in safety. Emesis/vomiting and thirst were observed, but episodes of diarrhea or constipation by excessive action were few. Polycarbophil calcium seems promising as an anti-IBS agent.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this phenomenological analysis was to describe perceptions of women with irritable bowel syndrome regarding the relationship of diet to their symptoms. Thirty-five women ages 18-45 with a medical diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome or symptoms compatible with a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome were interviewed and completed questionnaires as part of a larger study. During the interview, the women were asked what they thought caused their symptoms. Overall, women tried to adjust their diet to achieve a "Range of Comfort" so their symptoms were tolerable or manageable. To do this, women used a process of "Trial and Error." If a link could be made to diet, then women developed "Self-care Strategies" to maintain a "Healthy Diet." Women who failed to find a relationship during the "Trial and Error" process either felt the frustration of "Uncertainty" or, for a few women, decided that adjusting their diet was not worth the bother. This study suggests diet and eating behaviors are an important starting point for many women as they try to manage their irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fructose malabsorption is characterized by the inability to absorb fructose efficiently. As a consequence fructose reaches the colon where it is broken down by bacteria to short fatty acids, CO2, H2, CH4 and lactic acid. Bloating, cramps, osmotic diarrhea and other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are the consequence and can be seen in about 50% of fructose malabsorbers. Recently it was found that fructose malabsorption was associated with early signs of depressive disorders. Therefore, it was investigated whether fructose malabsorption is associated with abnormal tryptophan metabolism. METHODS: Fifty adults (16 men, 34 women) with gastrointestinal discomfort were analyzed by measuring breath hydrogen concentrations after an oral dose of 50 g fructose after an overnight fast. They were classified as normals or fructose malabsorbers according to their breath H2 concentrations. All patients filled out a Beck depression inventory questionnaire. Blood samples were taken for plasma tryptophan and kynurenine measurements. RESULTS: Fructose malabsorption (breath deltaH2 production >20 ppm) was detected in 35 of 50 individuals (70%). Subjects with fructose malabsorption showed significantly lower plasma tryptophan concentrations and significantly higher scores in the Beck depression inventory compared to those with normal fructose absorption. CONCLUSIONS: Fructose malabsorption is associated with lower tryptophan levels that may play a role in the development of depressive disorders. High intestinal fructose concentration seems to interfere with L-tryptophan metabolism, and it may reduce availability of tryptophan for the biosynthesis of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). Fructose malabsorption should be considered in patients with symptoms of depression and disturbances of tryptophan metabolism.},

RESULTS: Family history of hysteria or mental disease and vegetorsis was closely related to IBS, with ORs 3 and 4 respectively. There was alse close relationship between IBS and psychic trauma, often taking antibiotics, tension at work and eating sweet potato or cassava, with ORs between 1 and 2. CONCLUSION: Our investigation suggested that the six major risk factors mentioned above played important roles in the progression of IBS in Zhanjiang city.},

It is characterised by abdominal pain, excessive flatus, variable bowel habit and abdominal bloating for which there is no evidence of detectable organic disease. Suggested aetiologies include gut motility and psychological disorders, psychophysiological phenomena and colonic malfermentation. The faecal microflora in IBS has been shown to be abnormal with higher numbers of facultative organisms and low numbers of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Although there is no evidence of food allergy in IBS, food intolerance has been identified and exclusion diets are beneficial to many IBS patients. Food intolerance may be due to abnormal fermentation of food residues in the colon, as a result of disruption of the normal flora. The role of probiotics in IBS has not been clearly defined. Some studies have shown improvements in pain and flatulence in response to probiotic administration, whilst others have shown no symptomatic improvement. It is possible that the future role of probiotics in IBS will lie in prevention, rather than cure.},

Subjects were then given comparable amounts of white grape juice for 1 year. The initial symptoms did not recur in any of the subjects who initially responded to the juice-free diet. Of the 15 subjects who did not respond to the juice-free diet, seven became asymptomatic. Overall, 20 subjects (71%) were asymptomatic, and eight (29%) had no change in their symptoms. Some individuals with irritable bowel syndrome have their symptoms based on their malabsorption of carbohydrates present in apple juice and pear nectar and may improve with adequate choices of fruit juice such as changing to white grape juice.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Previous reports have linked irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) etiologically with various forms of mucosal inflammation, including infectious enterocolitides and inflammatory bowel disease. The mechanism is uncertain but may involve sensitization by inflammatory mediators. The enteropathy of celiac disease has theoretical advantages as a study model because it can be controlled with dietary gluten exclusion; however, whether it also predisposes to functional bowel disorders is unclear. Therefore, we assessed the prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in adult celiac patients and correlated this with dietary compliance with gluten exclusion. METHODS: Adult patients (n = 150; 106 women and 44 men) with confirmed celiac disease were randomly selected from a computerized database of >350 patients, and were asked to complete a bowel questionnaire and the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). The control group (n = 162; 133 women and 29 men) had no history of celiac disease and had similar mean age and sex profile. RESULTS: Of 150 celiac patients reviewed, 30 of 150 (20%) fulfilled the Rome criteria compared with eight of 162 (5%) ontrols. Of the celiac patients 10 of 46 (22%) had partial or no compliance with a gluten-free diet, whereas 20 of 104 patients (19%) adhered to the diet; this difference did not achieve statistical significance. Celiac patients with IBS-type symptoms had a markedly lower quality of life than those without, all eight domains being impaired to a clinically significant extent. Dietary gluten exclusion improved QOL in four of eight scales measured. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that mucosal inflammation in celiac disease may have a sensitizing effect or may predispose to IBS-type symptoms is supported by these results. Failure to attain optimal subjective well-being is common in celiac patients, particularly in those with coexisting IBS. Compliance with a gluten-free diet confers some benefit.},

   abstract = {Functional (nonulcer) dyspepsia refers to upper abdominal pain or discomfort with or without symptoms of early satiety, nausea, or vomiting with no definable organic cause. The current Rome II criteria help to diagnose functional dyspepsia and avoid misdiagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome as functional dyspepsia. Assessment of gastric emptying with scintigraphy or breath testing may be useful in identifying delayed gastric emptying in patients with dyspeptic symptoms and may be helpful in patient management. Electrogastrography is a noninvasive test that evaluates for gastric dysrhythmias. Satiety testing is being evaluated as an indirect test for impaired fundic relaxation and visceral hypersensitivity. The symptom response to Helicobacter pylori therapy in patients with functional dyspepsia and a negative endoscopy examination but a positive H. pylori test is marginal. Lifestyle modifications often are suggested for initial treatment of functional dyspepsia. Dietary changes such as frequent small meals, low-fat diet, and avoidance of certain aggravating foods may improve symptoms. Additional measures include cessation of smoking, avoiding excess alcohol intake, and minimizing coffee intake. Antacids and over-the-counter histamine type 2 receptor antagonists may be helpful as an "on-demand" therapy for intermittent symptoms. They are safe and relatively inexpensive. Different subgroups of functional dyspepsia are based on the predominant symptom and may help in choosing an appropriate drug to initiate therapy. If the predominant symptom is epigastric pain (ulcer-like functional dyspepsia), histamine-2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors are the initial treatment of choice. If fullness, bloating, early satiety or nausea is the predominant complaint (dysmotility-like functional dyspepsia), a prokinetic agent may help. Metoclopramide is the only available effective prokinetic agent at present. If metoclopramide is used, short-term treatment and discussion of possible side effects with the patient are advised. If there is no response to these initial treatments, switching therapy from proton pump inhibitor to prokinetic or vice versa can be tried. If these treatment options fail, patient re-evaluation for other disorders (including other functional bowel disorders) is advised. A low-dose tricyclic antidepressant at bedtime may be helpful for treatment of visceral hypersensitivity.},

   abstract = {High-fiber diet supplementation is commonly used in IBS, although it poses several management problems. Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) has shown beneficial effects in animal and human studies, but its potential role in IBS symptom relief has not been evaluated yet. We investigated PHGG in IBS patients and compared it to a wheat bran diet. Abdominal pain, bowel habits, and subjective overall rating were longitudinally evaluated in 188 adult IBS patients (139 women and 49 men) for 12 weeks. Patients were classified as having diarrhea-predominant, constipation-predominant, or changeable bowel habits and were randomly assigned to groups receiving fiber (30 g/day of wheat bran) or PHGG (5 g/day). After four weeks, patients were allowed to switch group, depending on their subjective evaluation of their symptoms. Significantly more patients switched from fiber to PHGG (49.9%) than from PHGG to fiber (10.9%) at four weeks. Per protocol analysis showed that both fiber and PHGG were effective in improving pain and bowel habits, but no difference was found between the two groups. Conversely, intention-to-treat analysis showed a significantly greater success in the PHGG group (60%) than in the fiber group (40%). Moreover, significantly more patients in the PHGG group reported a greater subjective improvement than those in the Fiber group. In conclusion, improvements in core IBS symptoms (abdominal pain and bowel habits) were observed with both bran and PHGG, but the latter was better tolerated and preferred by patients, revealing a higher probability of success than bran and a lower probability of patients abandoning the prescribed regimen, suggesting that it can increase the benefits deriving from fiber intake in IBS, making it a valid option to consider for high-fiber diet supplementation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine if confirmation of hypolactasia offers any benefit to the dietary treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two consecutive IBS patients (37 male, 85 female) were given lactose hydrogen breath tests (LHBT). Those with positive LHBT followed a low lactose diet for 3 weeks. Those improving on the diet were given double-blind, placebo-controlled challenges (DBPCC) with 5 g, 10 g and 15 g of lactose and a placebo, to confirm lactose intolerance. Those who did not respond to the low lactose diet followed either an exclusion or low fibre diet. Symptoms scores were kept prior to the LHBT, 8 h post-LHBT and daily whilst following any dietary change. Patients with negative LHBT returned to clinic and subsequent dietary interventions were recorded. RESULTS: LHBT was positive in 33/122 (27%) IBS patients. Syrr otom scores prior to LHBT were not significantly different between the two groups, but after LHBT the symptoms in the positive group were significantly worse. Twenty-three patients followed a low-lactose diet of which only nine (39%) improved. Six who did not improve followed an exclusion diet, three improved and all were intolerant of milk. Three tried a low fibre diet with two improving. DBPCC were inconclusive. In the negative LHBT group 35 agreed to try a diet and 24 improved (69%). Eight were intolerant of cow's milk. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a low lactose diet was disappointing in IBS patients with lactose malabsorption. Food intolerance was demonstrated in IBS patients with positive or negative LHBT and milk was identified as a problem in both groups. DBPCC were inconclusive. There appears to be little advantage in trying to separate patients who malabsorb lactose from others with IBS.},

Thus, for example, diet is of decisive importance in celiac disease and lactose intolerance. In contrast, dietary measures are ineffective in the treatment of gallstones, and uncertain as a prophylactic measure against biliary colic. While dietetic measures are an important temporary measure in acute pancreatitis, in chronic pancreatitis such an approach is often not complied with, since it includes abstinence from alcohol. In chronic inflammatory bowel disease, diet can ameliorate a number of complications, although it leaves the pathological process itself unaffected. High-fiber diet is, for the most part, ineffective in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The present article discusses the benefits of dietary measures in a number of gastroenterological disorders.},

   abstract = {Aerophagia refers to a rather rare disorder that may occur in both children and adults that features repetitive air swallowing and belching and that may result in abdominal distention. There are few, if any, controlled studies to guide therapy, which remains largely supportive but may include behavioral therapy and psychotherapy. Bloating, distention, and other gas-related symptoms are common in functional gastrointestinal disorders, including the irritable bowel syndrome; their pathophysiology remains, for the most part, poorly understood. Two separate phenomena need to be distinguished in these disorders: gas production and gas perception. Thus, whereas gas production, which relates most closely to flatus emissions, is probably within the normal range in most patients with irritable bowel syndrome, gas transport or transit through the gut may be impaired and may lead to the retention of gas within segments of the gut. Visceral hypersensitivity, a common phenomenon in all functional disorders, may exacerbate the sensation of distention and contribute to other "gas-related" symptoms. Few controlled studies have addressed any of these issues. Although, on an empiric basis, dietary therapy may be partially effective in some situations, there is at present no data to support the use of any form of pharmacologic, endoscopic, or surgical therapy for any of these symptoms.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 189 schoolboys and 250 schoolgirls aged 14-17 years from four randomly chosen schools of Novosibirsk participated in the study. RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS defined according to Rome criteria was higher in girls (24 vs 14% in boys, p = 0.01). Colonic pain frequency was similar in both genders (11% in girls vs 9% in boys, p = 0.46), however disturbed defecation occurred significantly more often in girls than in boys (16 vs 7%, p = 0.003). Half of the subjects who reported IBS had also dyspeptic symptoms. Fiber-rich diet and/or laxatives to prevent constipation were used by 2% of boys and 7% of girls (p = 0.012). However, only one third of those having less than 3 stools a week thought it abnormal. IBS is associated with the age over 15-16 years, female gender, abdominal pain in childhood, appendectomy, irregular meals and smoking (in girls). No association was found with other socio-demographic factors and serological markers of some infections and invasions (H. pylori, G. lamblia, O. felineus, hepatitis viruses B and C). Of the persons with diagnosable IBS, 49% have consulted a physician about it, 21% have undergone upper endoscopy. School absenteeism was reported by 62% of the IBS sufferers. CONCLUSION: IBS is common among adolescents (especially girls) with the prevalence rates similar to those described in adults from West Europe and USA. These disorders are associated with significant disability and health care costs.},

In the western world, 8% to 23% of adults have IBS and its socioeconomic cost is substantial. Research-generated insights have led to the understanding of IBS as a disorder of brain-gut regulation. The experience of symptoms derives from dysregulation of the bidirectional communication system between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain, mediated by neuroendocrine and immunological factors and modulated by psychosocial factors. The biopsychosocial model integrates the various physical and psychosocial factors that contribute to the patient's illness. This model and the recently revised symptom-based criteria (i.e. the "Rome II criteria") form the basis for establishing a comprehensive and effective approach for the diagnosis and management of the disorder.},

   abstract = {Three decades ago, the observations of Trowell and Burkitt gave rise to the "fibre theory", in which it was contended that there was a link between the consumption of a diet rich in fibre and non-processed carbohydrates and the level of protection against many of the "first world diseases" such as constipation, diverticulosis, cancer of the colon, diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. Since that time, numerous studies have been presented to analyze the relationship between fibre and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract and other processes with severe health implications. The present revision looks at the experience accumulated over this period regarding the importance of the consumption of fibre for certain phatologies. It not only deals with the epidemiological relationship existing between fibre intake and the development of diseases such as cancer of the colon or cardiovascular disorders but also reviews the interest of fibre a therapeutic agent, in view of the current information available on its different mechanism of action. Thus the possibility of using soluble fibre has taken on renewed interest for the treatment of inflammatory intestinal disease, for control of diarrhoea, in irritable bowel syndrome or no modulate the concentrations of glycaemia or cholesterol. Three is a discussion of the discrepancies found between the consumption of fibre and diverticular disease, the treatment of constipation and the association with obesity and cardiovascular disease. Despite the accumulated evidence on the consumption of fibre, there is currently no consensus as to recommendations on what type of fibre and the optimal amount that should be consumed. A high fibre intake (> 25-30 g/day) based on a variety of food sources (fruit, vegetable, legumes, cereals) is the only way to avoid many of the disorders mentioned. The consumption of a particular type of fibre (soluble or insoluble) is limited to the treatment of certain processes, because its individual relationship with many disorders is still pending determination.},

   abstract = {Because treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients can be frustrating to the clinician and patient as well, the physician should strive to gain the patient's confidence with a concise, appropriate work-up and by offering reassurance and education that IBS is a functional disorder without significant long-term health risks. First-line treatment should be aimed at treating the most bothersome symptom. Tricyclic antidepressants are superior to placebo in reducing abdominal pain scores, as well as improving global symptom severity. Loperamide is superior to placebo in managing IBS-associated diarrhea. Whereas fiber has a role in treating constipation, its value for IBS or, specifically, in the relief of abdominal pain or diarrhea associated with IBS is controversial. Although certain antispasmodics have demonstrated superiority over placebo in managing abdominal pain, none of these agents are available in the United States. Probiotic therapy using Lactobacillus plantarum has demonstrated superiority to placebo in improving pain, regulating bowel habits, and decreasing flatulence. As studied in a recent placebo-controlled prospective study, Chinese herbal medicines significantly improved bowel symptom scores and global symptom profile, and reduced IBS-related quality of life impairment. Some of the most promising emerging therapies in IBS revolve around targeted pharmacotherapeutic modulation of serotonin receptors (ie, 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 subtypes), which are involved in sensory and motor functions of the gut. Other investigational agents that are also being explored include cholecystokinin antagonists, alpha2-adrenergic agonists (eg, clonidine), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, citalopram), and neurokinin antagonists. IBS is best understood through the biopsychosocial paradigm, and therefore, its effective management requires a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach based on patient education and reassurance, enhanced by diet recommendations and lifestyle modifications, and complemented by pharmacotherapy and psychosocial intervention in more severe cases.},

In the colon they are mainly degraded by anaerobic bacteria in a process called fermentation. As a consequence, faecal nitrogen excretion is enhanced, which is used clinically to prevent or treat hepatic encephalopathy. Low-digestible carbohydrates are trophic to the epithelia of the ileum and colon, which helps to avoid bacterial translocation. Short-chain fatty acids are important fermentation products and are evaluated as new therapeutics in acute colitis. They are considered in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer. The bifidogenic effect of fructo-oligosaccharides merits further attention, Unfermented carbohydrates increase faecal bulk and play a role in the treatment of chronic functional constipation, symptomatic diverticulosis and, possibly, the irritable bowel syndrome. In conclusion, low-digestible carbohydrates may play a role in the maintenance of human digestive health. However, the strength of evidence differs between disease entities.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether it is possible to separate cases of irritable bowel syndrome associated with excess total hydrogen production (as a surrogate of colonic fermentation; these patients may be offered an exclusion diet as treatment) from other causes of irritable bowel syndrome by determining the amount of hydrogen excreted on patients' breath after oral administration of lactulose. DESIGN: Comparison of 24-hour hydrogen excretion and breath hydrogen following lactulose in untreated patients fulfilling the Rome criteria for irritable bowel syndrome, normal controls and irritable bowel syndrome patients who had previously failed to improve on an exclusion diet. METHODS: Colonic fermentation was measured by indirect calorimetry over 24 h. Immediately after calorimetry, the patients who were fasting received 20 g lactulose; end-expiratory breath samples were then collected every 30 min for 3 h. Hydrogen concentrations were determined by an electro-chemical cell. RESULTS: The total 24-hour excretion of hydrogen was significantly greater in the irritable bowel syndrome group (median 333.7 ml/24 h, interquartile range 234.7-445.67) compared to the normal volunteers (median 203.1 ml/24 h, interquartile range 131.4-256; P = 0.002) or the failed-diet group (median 204.5 ml/24 h, interquartile range 111.35-289.13; P = 0.015). No difference was detected in breath excretion of hydrogen following lactulose in any group. CONCLUSION: Total hydrogen production over 24 h is increased in some patients with irritable bowel syndrome who may respond to exclusion diets. However, this sub-group of patients cannot be identified by measuring breath-hydrogen excretion after lactulose.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dyspepsia is a common complaint in the general population. The prevalence, demography and economic implications of dyspepsia in India are not known; we studied these using a detailed symptom questionnaire. METHODS: 2549 presumably healthy adults (mean age 37.2 [14.1] years; 1441 men) were interviewed. Gastrointestinal symptoms, their investigation and treatment, dietary history and history of addictions were noted. Dyspepsia was defined as abdominal fullness or upper abdominal pain present for at least one month; irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was defined by Manning's criteria. Based on the symptom profile, subjects were divided into three broad groups: no dyspepsia (n=1695; 945 men), dyspepsia with (110; 63 men) or without (664; 382 men) IBS, and IBS alone (80; 51 men). RESULTS: 774 subjects (30.4%) had dyspepsia; the median (range) duration of symptoms was 24 (1-360) months. Abdominal fullness (n=614), abdominal pain (374), heartburn (272) and belching (271) were the most common symptoms; significant symptoms (present at least once a week) occurred in 306 subjects (12.0% of the population). More than half the subjects had symptoms suggestive of mixed type of dyspepsia; dysmotility-like dyspepsia was the next most common (n=257; 33.2%). The frequency of dyspepsia was not related to type of diet or consumption of spices. Dyspepsia was more prevalent in subjects who abused tobacco or alcohol. Three hundred and twenty-one subjects with dyspepsia (41.4%) had visited a physician for their complaints and had received treatment with antacids, acid suppressors or prokinetic drugs; 4.5% and 7.2% had undergone previous endoscopy and ultrasonography, respectively; dyspeptic subjects underwent more investigations (p<0.001) than those with IBS. CONCLUSIONS: Dyspepsia is reported by almost one-third of the population in Mumbai; significant symptoms occur in 12%. Forty percent of these subjects receive treatment and only a small number undergo endoscopy or ultrasonography.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Visceral hypersensitivity is a feature of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Postprandial symptoms are common in these patients. The effects of nutrients on colonic perception in IBS are incompletely understood. SUBJECTS: We studied 13 healthy subjects and 16 patients with IBS-eight had diarrhoea predominant (IBS-D) and eight constipation predominant (IBS-C) IBS. METHODS: Colonic perception thresholds to balloon distension and viscerosomatic referral pattern were assessed before and after duodenal infusion of lipid or saline, respectively. At the end of the infusions, plasma levels of gastrointestinal peptides were determined. RESULTS: Lipids lowered the thresholds for first sensation, gas, discomfort, and pain in the IBS group but only for gas in the control group. The percent reduction in thresholds for gas and pain after lipids was greater in the IBS and IBS-D groups but not in the IBS-C group compared with controls. IBS patients had an increased area of referred discomfort and pain after lipids compared with before infusion whereas the referral area remained unchanged in controls. No group differences in colonic tone or compliance were observed. In both groups higher levels of cholecystokinin, pancreatic polypeptide, peptide YY, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and neuropeptide Y were seen after lipids. Motilin levels were higher in patients and differences in the subgroups were observed. Levels of corticotrophin releasing factor were lower in the constipated group than in the diarrhoea group. CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial symptoms in IBS patients may be explained in part by a nutrient dependent exaggerated sensory component of the gastrocolonic response.},

However, existing studies have come to different conclusions about the role of food in the pathophysiology of IBS. We explored the prevalence of subjective food-related gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and its relationship to clinical characteristics and psychological factors in IBS. METHODS: 330 patients with IBS and 80 healthy volunteers completed a food questionnaire developed for this study. The subjects graded their subjective symptoms after 35 different foods and a food score was obtained by adding the item scores. The relationship between subjective food-related GI symptoms and referral status, IBS subgroup (predominant bowel pattern), sex, anxiety, depression and body mass index (BMI) was estimated. RESULTS: In 209 (63%) of the patients the GI symptoms were related to meals. Gas problems and abdominal pain were the most frequently reported symptoms. Foods rich in carbohydrates, as well as fatty food, coffee, alcohol and hot spices were most frequently reported to cause symptoms. The food score was higher in patients than in controls (p < 0.0001). In the IBS group higher scores were observed in patients with anxiety (p = 0.005), and females (p < 0.001), but the results were unrelated to IBS subgroup, referral status or BMI. The BMI did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: A majority of IBS patients consider their symptoms to be related to meals. Especially foods rich in carbohydrates and fat cause problems. Nevertheless, the majority of IBS patients are normal or overweight. Female sex and anxiety predict a high degree of food-related symptoms in IBS.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) consists of various subtypes. It is not known whether these subtypes share a common pathophysiology. Evaluation of motor and sensory function of the rectum using a barostat may help to explore a common pathophysiological background or differences in pathophysiology in subtypes of IBS. We have evaluated compliance, tone and sensitivity of the rectum, in both fasting state and postprandially, using a computerized barostat in 15 patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), 14 patients with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) and compared the results with those obtained in 12 healthy controls. Rectal compliance as calculated over the steep part of the pressure-volume curve (17-23 mmHg) was decreased in both IBS groups (IBS-D 8.0 +/- 1.4 mL mmHg-1; IBS-C 5.6 +/- 1.1 mL mmHg-1) compared with controls (24.7 +/- 3.5 mL mmHg-1). The perception of urge was increased only in IBS-D patients, whereas pain perception was significantly increased in both IBS groups. Spontaneous adaptive relaxation was decreased in IBS-D patients. Postprandially, rectal volume decreased significantly in the controls and in IBS-D patients, but not in IBS-C patients. In conclusion, both rectal motor and sensory characteristics are different between IBS-D and IBS-C patients. Therefore, testing of rectal visceroperception, adaptive relaxation and the rectal response to a meal may help distinguish groups of patients with different subtypes of irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome affects 10% of adults with an unexplained female predominance. Although only a few people see their family doctor, the disease causes reduced quality of life and represents a multi-billion pound health-care problem. The disorder clusters in families, which is possibly because of intra-familial learning and a genetic predisposition. Visceral hypersensitivity is a key feature in most patients. Results of imaging studies of regional cerebral blood flow during rectal distension suggest underlying disturbances of central processing of afferent signals, though this is not unique to the disorder, since it is seen in other chronic pain syndromes. Environmental factors that are strongly implicated in at least some patients include gastrointestinal infection and inflammation and chronic stress. Diagnosis is based on positive symptoms and absence of any alarm indicators. Treatment remains unsatisfactory and hinges on an excellent doctor-patient relationship, with drugs for symptom exacerbations. Cognitive behavioural treatment, psychotherapy, and hypnosis could provide long-lasting benefit in some patients. Tricyclic antidepressants in low doses seem to be the most effective class of drugs for the disorder on the basis of limited data.},

   abstract = {The efforts of clinical researchers, lay organizations and pharmaceutical companies have increased the public profile of irritable bowel syndrome and made it a respectable diagnosis. Diagnostic symptom criteria encourage a firm clinical diagnosis, which is the foundation of a logical management strategy. This begins with education. Reassurance that no structural disease threatens should be tempered with the reality that symptoms are likely to recur over many years. Patients expect diet and lifestyle advice, even if this is not specific to irritable bowel syndrome. Only a few of those with irritable bowel syndrome see doctors, and even fewer see specialists. Therefore, the treating physician should ascertain the reason for the visit, the patient's fears and the presence of any comorbid illness, such as depression, that might require treatment in its own right. No drug treatment is useful for all of the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and many patients require no drug at all. If used, drugs should target the predominant symptom. Alosetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, is effective in treating women with irritable bowel syndrome who also have diarrhoea. Tegaserod, a 5-HT4 agonist, is useful for women with irritable bowel syndrome who are constipated. Most patients with irritable bowel syndrome need psychological support. Reassurance, discussion and relaxation techniques can be provided by the family doctor. Difficult psychopathology may require referral to a mental health professional, and the gastroenterologist can settle diagnostic uncertainties. In all cases, successful treatment depends on a confident diagnosis and the strength of the doctor-patient relationship.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop recommendations for the diagnosis and management of irritable bowel syndrome for European doctors delivering primary care. These recommendations can be adapted by local medical groups according to their language, custom and health-care systems. METHODS: Twenty-one general practitioners and gastroenterologists from Europe attended a workshop planned by a steering committee. After a state-of-the-art symposium, four working groups considered the following aspects of irritable bowel syndrome management: what to tell the patient, diagnosis, non-medical treatment and psychosocial management. Current and future drug management was reviewed by the steering committee. The resulting recommendations were considered at two plenary sessions during the meeting, and by circulation of the material during development of the manuscript. RESULTS: The process permitted a unique dialogue between general practitioners and gastroenterologists, in which it was necessary to reconcile the specialists' emphasis on thoroughness with the practical, epidemiological and economic realities of primary care. Despite this dichotomy, consensus was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: European general practitioners and gastroenterologists have produced recommendations that emphasize education of the patient, a positive symptom-based diagnosis, diet and lifestyle advice, psychological support and a critical analysis of current specific psychological and pharmacological treatments.},

   abstract = {The philosophy that food can be health promoting beyond its nutritional value is gaining acceptance. Known disease preventive aspects of nutrition have led to a new science, the 'functional food science'. Functional foods, first introduced in Japan, have no universally accepted definition but can be described as foods or food ingredients that may provide health benefits and prevent diseases. Currently, there is a growing interest in these products. However, not all regulatory issues have been settled yet. Five categories of foods can be classified as functional foods: dietary fibers, vitamins and minerals, bioactive substances, fatty acids and pro-, pre- and symbiotics. The latter are currently the main focus of research. Functional foods can be applied in pediatrics: during pregnancy, nutrition is 'functional' since it has prenatal influences on the intra-uterine development of the baby, after birth, 'functional' human milk supports adequate growth of infants and pro- and prebiotics can modulate the flora composition and as such confer certain health advantages. Functional foods have also been studied in pediatric diseases. The severity of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal allergy and lactose intolerance may be reduced by using functional foods. Functional foods have proven to be valuable contributors to the improvement of health and the prevention of diseases in pediatric populations.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a remarkably frequent disorder that leads to relevant impairment in patients' quality of life. Four mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of IBS: altered intestinal motility; increased visceral sensitivity; disturbed intestinal reflexes (intrinsic and extrinsic), and psychological disorders. The close relationship between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system (the brain-gut axis) is the basis of the actual research on IBS therapy. It is conceivable that in the near future a better understanding of IBS pathophysiology will help us to tailor treatment for different IBS patients. At the moment, the subclassification of the diverse patterns of symptomatology allows the adjustment of treatments for IBS according to the clinical predominance of each patient. Dietary modifications like fiber supplementation, antidiarrheal agents and antispasmodic drugs are the basis of the current treatment of IBS and depend on the predominant symptom (constipation, diarrhea or pain, respectively). If severe pain is present, antidepressant agents are an appropriate alternative. However, the scientific evidence supporting this current therapeutic approach is limited. Visceral analgesics and serotonin agonists and antagonists may play an important therapeutic role in the near future. However, it is not likely that one single treatment will help every IBS patient and many of them will need a more complex approach with multidisciplinary therapy (diet, psychotherapy, medications).},

We measured serum immunoglobulin (Ig) A against gliadin and tissue-transglutaminase, and IgA and IgM against gliadin, tissue-transglutaminase (intestinal cd-associated antibodies), and the dietary proteins beta-lactoglobulin and ovalbumin in duodenal aspirate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were counted in histology sections, and the expression of HLA-DQ2 (A1*0501/B1*0201) was investigated by polymerase chain reaction. In 26 IBS patients, the effect of 6 months of gluten withdrawal was examined. RESULTS: Most cd patients expressed HLA-DQ2 and had increased intestinal cd-associated antibodies, whereas cd-associated serum IgA and IEL counts were increased in active cd in contrast to treated or latent cd. In IBS patients, 35% were HLA-DQ2-positive, 23% had increased IEL counts, and 0% and 30% had increased cd-associated antibodies in serum and duodenal aspirate, respectively. Furthermore, stool frequency and intestinal IgA decreased significantly under a gluten-free diet in the subgroups of HLA-DQ2-positive and intestinal antibody-positive IBS patients when compared with IBS patients without these markers. CONCLUSIONS: HLA-DQ2 expression and increased intestinal cd-associated antibodies are markers that can identify latent/potential cd in a subgroup of IBS patients who consequently appear to profit from a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of alosetron, a treatment recently approved in the United States for irritable bowel syndrome in diarrhea-predominant female patients, on health-related quality of life. METHODS: Quality of life was assessed as part of two 12-wk randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled irritable bowel syndrome studies comparing alosetron 1 mg b.i.d. with placebo (S3BA3001 and S3BA3002). Patients completed a validated disease-specific quality of life questionnaire, the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBSQOL), at baseline and at the 12-wk or final visit. The clinical relevance of data were also evaluated by a minimal meaningful difference instrument. RESULTS: A total of 626 and 647 patients were enrolled in studies S3BA3001 and S3BA3002, respectively. Approximately 70% of patients in each study had diarrhea-predominant IBS. In diarrhea-predominant patients enrolled in S3BA3001, statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvements with alosetron versus placebo were observed on all nine IBSQOL scales (emotional health, mental health, sleep, energy, physical functioning, food/diet, social functioning, role-physical, and sexual relations) and for all but one scale (mental health) in S3BA3002. In both studies, a significantly greater percentage of patients treated with alosetron (p < 0.05) experienced clinically meaningful improvement on three of the nine IBSQOL scales (food/diet, social functioning, and role-physical) compared with patients treated with placebo. Patients treated with alosetron did not show worsening in any quality of life domain compared with patients treated with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: These results in women with diarrhea-predominant IBS demonstrate that alosetron significantly improves health-related quality of life.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common diagnoses made in the primary care setting and is responsible for up to 40% of referrals to gastroenterologists. Approximately 70% of persons who meet the diagnostic criteria for IBS do not seek health care, and the remaining account for 12% of visits to primary care providers. IBS is a functional bowel disordered comprising abdominal pain associated with defecation or a change in bowel habit with features of disordered defecation and distension in the absence of any demonstrable abnormality. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings and the exclusion of other disorders. New pharmaceutical agents are available to treat the underlying disorder; however, the treatment of IBS still involves a comprehensive, multicomponent approach that includes medical management of dominant symptoms, dietary modifications, and, possibly, psychotherapy.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome is a common condition but its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Many irritable bowel syndrome patients give a history of food intolerance, but data from dietary elimination and re-challenge studies are inconclusive. Multiple aetio-pathological mechanisms have been postulated. The gut has an extensive immune system but current understanding of processing of food antigens in health and disease is limited. There is no clinically useful marker available to test for food hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome. Researchers have employed both skin tests and serum immunoglobulins (IgG and IgE) as markers of food hypersensitivity in various disorders including irritable bowel syndrome, but published data are equivocal. In this article, the evidence for the role of food hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome is reviewed and, based on the available data, a possible pathophysiological hypothesis has been formulated.},

   abstract = {A significant proportion of IBS patients attribute their symptoms to adverse food reactions. Dietary elimination and re-challenge studies support the role of diet in the pathogenesis of IBS. The aetiopathogenesis of IBS is thought to be multifactorial involving an interaction between diet, infection, antibiotics and psychosocial factors. Serum IgE and IgG4 antibodies are elevated in food hypersensitivity induced atopic conditions and a similar mechanism has been postulated in IBS. Increased number of mast cells is present in the ileocaecal region of IBS patients. Once sensitized, they are capable of inducing secretory and sensorimotor abnormalities of the gut. The management of IBS is usually aimed at controlling symptoms, however, evaluation of food hypersensitivity may provide a useful adjunct in those with severe symptoms or a clear history of adverse food reaction. There are no well-established tests available but skin prick tests and food specific serum IgG4 and IgE antibodies may help in identifying the offending foods. Other options, which may be explored in individual cases, include sequential dietary exclusion, use of hypoallergenic diets, disodium cromoglycate and novel techniques such as colonoscopic allergen provocation test. Pathophysiology of hypersensitivity induced IBS has been discussed in the light of current data and a management algorithm has been proposed for managing food hypersensitivity in IBS.},
