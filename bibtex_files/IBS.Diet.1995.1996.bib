   abstract = {In recent years, many health claims have been made about dietary and supplemental fiber. However, some reports (eg, those regarding oat bran) have been controversial. A review of scientifically rigorous studies shows that fiber has some preventive or therapeutic benefits in irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulosis, colorectal cancer, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. However, it appears to have no direct benefit in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, gallstones, or obesity. The United States has one of the lowest per capita intakes of fiber in the world. Therefore, increasing daily fiber intake either through diet or with supplements is recommended for most Americans. Consumer interest groups should lobby for more fiber-enriched foods. The challenge for education and healthcare professionals alike is to remold the nation's interest in and understanding of dietary fiber.},

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of adverse reactions to food in patients with gastrointestinal disease. A total of 375 adult patients of a gastroenterologic outpatient clinic were examined by history, skin tests, measurements of laboratory parameters, and intestinal provocation with food allergens by colonoscopy. Some 32% complained of adverse reactions to food as a cause of their abdominal symptoms. In 14.4%, the diagnosis of intestinal food allergy could be suspected according to several criteria such as elevated total IgE, specific IgE against food antigens, eosinophilia, responsiveness to cromoglycate, and clinical signs of atopic disease. In 3.2%, the diagnosis could be confirmed by endoscopic allergen provocation and/or elimination diet and rechallenge. In conclusion, the data suggest that allergic reactions to food antigens may be a causative factor in a subgroup of patients with inflammatory and functional gastrointestinal disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of lactose malabsorption (LM) in the Caucasian population of northern Europe is estimated to be low. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common diagnosis, and its symptoms are nearly identical to those of LM. Therefore we investigated the prevalence of LM among IBS patients in comparison with healthy volunteers. DESIGN: A double-blind clinical trial compared with healthy controls. SETTING: One out-patient gastroenterology clinic in the Netherlands. PATIENTS: 70 Caucasian IBS patients and 35 healthy volunteers (staff members). METHODS: All 105 underwent hydrogen (H2) breath and blood glucose tests, after an oral intake of 50 grams of lactose. The IBS patients were treated with a lactose-restricted diet for 6 weeks. They completed a lactose intake score before, and a symptom score scored by six separate criteria, before, during and after treatment. RESULTS: In 17 out of 70 (24.3%) IBS patients LM was detected, in comparison with 2 out of 35 (5.7%) controls (P < 0.009). There was no difference in the pre-entry mean lactose intake and symptom score between the LM positive and negative IBS patients. The mean symptom score of the LM positive group showed a marked decrease after 6 weeks of dietary therapy (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A substantial number of IBS patients showed a clinically unrecognized lactose malabsorption, which could not be discriminated by symptoms and dietary history, and which can be treated with a lactose-restricted diet. Therefore LM has to be excluded before the diagnosis IBS is made.},

Patients were divided according to clinical symptoms and age: Toddler's diarrhoea (TD) under 3 years of age and recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) over 3 years of age characteristics in children with TD and RAP were compared with those found in 114 subjects suffering from various gastrointestinal diseases (GIC) and in 192 normal children. This analysis allowed a complete profile of children with IBS in Italy to be obtained. The TD group, and to a lesser extent the RAP group, differ from the GIC and healthy controls (HC) on the basis of telephone calls to the doctor, physician visits, inappropriate dietary restrictions, multiple medications and multiple non-GI complaints. For children under 3, a history of food intolerance and the presence of mucus and undigested food in the feces are the variables that discriminate patients with IBS from those with GIC; for children over 3, colics in the first 3 months of life, a history of food intolerance, loose feces with abdominal pain, pain relieved by evacuation and undigested vegetables in the feces most discriminate the two groups. Finally, we tried to compute a diagnostic score to discriminate IBS children from GIC: this proved to be sensitive to IBS but not specific enough to be of clinical utility.},

AIMS: To compare the extent of NO production in patients with infective versus non-infective forms of bowel dysfunction. SUBJECTS: Four groups: 20 healthy, volunteer clerical and laboratory staff, 12 patients with irritable bowel syndrome, 19 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and 20 patients with infective gastroenteritis. METHODS: The plasma nitrate concentration was determined with a copper coated cadmium column and spectrophotometry. Mean and median plasma nitrate concentrations were calculated and compared within the four groups. Mann-Whitney distribution free rank testing was used to compare the median values. RESULTS: Median plasma nitrate concentrations in the four groups were: controls 32.7 mumol/l; irritable bowel syndrome 35.5 mumol/l; inflammatory bowel disease 35.1 mumol/l; and gastroenteritis 117.9 mumol/l (p < 0.001 gastroenteritis v all other groups). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma nitrate concentration could serve as a discriminant between infective and inflammatory or functional bowel disease in patients presenting with diarrhoea. It is not clear why there is considerable difference in endogenous nitrate synthesis in these two conditions, which are both characterised by severe gut inflammation.},

The aims of this study were to (1) compare the clinical, jejunal motor, and psychological features in patients with IBS who have heightened sensitivity and those who have normal sensitivity to jejunal balloon distention and (2) examine psychosocial correlates of sensory and/or motor dysfunction. METHODS: Female patients with IBS (n = 24) and healthy controls (n = 9) underwent 24-hour ambulant duodenojejunal manometry, assessment of jejunal sensitivity by balloon distention, and comprehensive psychosocial assessment. RESULTS: In 6 (25%) and 10 (42%) patients, hypersensitivity was present at the threshold for initial perception and at the threshold for pain, respectively. After ingestion of a high-energy standard meal, all patients with heightened sensitivity for perception had abnormalities in the postprandial motor pattern compared with one third of patients with normal sensitivity. In this subgroup with hypersensitivity and postprandial dysmotility, clinical features were not discriminative but an inherently ineffectual coping style featuring both anger hyperreactivity and defensive control of anger was highly characteristic. CONCLUSIONS: In IBS, abnormal postprandial jejunal motor activity is related to jejunal mechanoreceptor-related hypersensitivity, and such sensorimotor dysfunction has a specific psychological profile.},

For all eligible subjects, a detailed questionnaire concerning characteristics of abdominal pain and defecatory pattern was completed at presentation. In addition, a battery of screening tests was performed and additional evaluation was done at the discretion of their physician. In all, 227 subjects fulfilled the entrance criteria, but 56 were subsequently excluded because of diagnoses of inflammatory bowel disease (nine cases), lactose malabsorption (46 cases), or celiac disease (one case). Of the remaining 171 patients, 117 had IBS symptoms. In the IBS subjects, lower abdominal discomfort (p < 0.001), cramping pain (p < 0.0009), and increased flatus (p < 0.0003) were more common, whereas dyspeptic symptoms such as epigastric discomfort (p < 0.003), pain radiating to the chest (p < 0.009), and regurgitation (p < 0.02) were more common in the non-IBS subjects. Our study not only confirms the clinical heterogeneity of children with recurrent abdominal pain but also concomitantly demonstrates that most children with this disorder have symptoms that fulfill the standardized criteria for IBS in adults. The identification of subgroups of children with recurrent abdominal pain can provide a framework for the diagnosis of functional bowel disease as well as establish the need for invasive and expensive tests.},

   abstract = {The first aim of the study was to find a cause of symptoms in patients suffering from "irritable bowel syndrome" using diagnostic tests aimed at functional disorders of lower gut. A second aim was to test, whether the presence of irritable bowel syndrome (or, synonymously, absence of classic organic disease) can be predicted by specific symptoms. 134 consecutive patients (50 +/- 16 SD years, range 17 to 88, 94 women) presenting in our gastroenterological outpatient department with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits were included. A conventional diagnostic work-up aimed at classic organic diseases and, if negative, a functional diagnostic work-up aimed at gastrointestinal malfunction such as dietary fibre trial, functional proctoscopy, defecography, colonic transit of radiopaque markers, anorectal manometry, and lactose tolerance test were done. A classic organic disease was found in only 15 of 134 patients by conventional diagnostic tests. Functional diagnostic work-up yielded a diagnosis in 70 of the remaining 119 patients that else would have been labeled to suffer from IBS (25 slow transit constipation, 20 disordered defecation, nine low fibre intake, and nine lactose intolerance among them). When symptoms were evaluated with a standardized questionnaire, "constipation" and the "necessity of straining to open bowels" were very specific for functional bowel disorder (92% and 100%), but sensitivity of both symptoms was only about 60%. The so-called "Manning criteria" had a very low prevalence in our sample and so were not discriminatory. Since in more than half of the patients with "irritable bowel syndrome" a specific diagnosis can be reached, functional tests should be considered in such patients. The symptom "constipation" in patients with lower gut complaints predicted a functional disorder rather than a classic organic disease with a high specificity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of peptic ulcer disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic constipation in two Iranian populations (pastoral nomads and industrial labourers) with different life styles, and to evaluate the risk factors associated with these diseases. SUBJECTS: A total of 455 randomly selected pastoral nomads and 492 industrial labourers (all male) aged between 35-55 years. METHODS: Demographic and social data were obtained by interviews. An upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy was performed and biopsy specimens were taken from subjects complaining of abdominal symptoms and randomly selected asymptomatic subjects. A urease test was performed on antral specimens. Serum pepsinogen I concentrations and Helicobacter pylori antibody titres were measured by radioimmunoassay and immunoglobulin (Ig) G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests, respectively. RESULTS: Serum pepsinogen I concentrations were similar in both nomads and industrial labourers, and the percentage with positive antibody titres for H. pylori was high in both populations (86.3 and 91% in nomads and industrial labourers, respectively). Industrial labourers were twice as likely to have duodenal ulcer (P < 0.05) than nomads. The prevalence of duodenal ulcer disease and gastric ulcer was 4.6 and 0.6% in nomads and 10.3 and 0.4% in industrial labourers, respectively. The prevalence of IBS was similar in nomads (3.1%) and industrial labourers (3.6%). Fewer nomads (1.4%) than industrial labourers (3.3%) had chronic constipation. Logistic regression analysis showed that being an industrial labourer, or smoker and having undergone previous non-gastric surgery were risk factors for duodenal ulcer disease. When the variable 'urease test' was included in the logistic regression analysis, smoking, a positive urease test and the quantity of fruit eaten per week were associated risk factors. The risk factors associated with IBS were the use of analgesics and back pain. The only risk factor associated with chronic constipation was being an industrial labourer. CONCLUSIONS: Industrial labourers were twice as likely to have duodenal ulcer disease as nomads. The prevalence of IBS and chronic constipation in the two male Iranian populations was lower than that found in western countries. Duodenal ulcer disease was associated with H. pylori colonization but not with a positive serum antibody titre for H. pylori. H. pylori colonization of the antral mucosa and smoking are causative factors for duodenal ulcer disease and fruit intake is possibly an associated factor.},

   abstract = {Symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) using the Manning Criteria were sought by a questionnaire administered to 400 (male-female ratio 3:1) apparently healthy medical students. With a response rate of 84%, 230 (65.5%) reported more than six episodes of abdominal pain in the preceding year (1992-1993). Contrary to expectation, 100 (43.5%) reported symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of IBS. The one-year period prevalence of the syndrome was 30% overall, with prevalence figures of 24% for males and 48% for females (P < 0.01). There was no difference in the type of diet (mainly high-fiber diets) consumed by subjects with and without IBS. About two thirds of the subjects with IBS had sought medical advice during the study period; the consultation behavior was influenced by factors such as the presence of other symptoms. This is the first detailed evidence in a random sample of an African population showing symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of IBS to be very common. It casts doubt on the assumption generated by other workers that IBS is rare among native Africans.},

   abstract = {Chronic diarrhea, defined by frequent bowel movements with decreased stool consistency lasting for longer than 3 weeks represents a major problem in gastroenterology. In addition to the very frequent functional disturbances of irritable bowel syndrome a wide variety of infectious, drug-induced, alimentary, metabolic, hormonal and organic causes requires a thorough evaluation of this symptom. To reach diagnosis an algorithm applying a wide array of diagnostic procedures based on the results of thorough anamnesis, physical examination and stool visit should be followed. In addition to alleviation of symptoms, reconstitution and prevention of nutrional deficits (volume, electrolytes, trace elements, vitamines, calories) therapeutic approaches should eliminate underlying causes whenever possible. Symptomatic relief is provided by substances inhibiting secretion and motility as the opiatagonist Loperamid or anticholinergics. Substitution of vitamins, trace elements, calories, enzymes or bile salts should be adapted to the individual needs. Elimination of a cause of chronic diarrhea is generally provided be anti-infectious therapy, other causes however (e.g. sprue by the elimination of gliadin from diet) may be treated effectively as well.},

   abstract = {The pathophysiology and treatment of colonic motility disorders are reviewed. Colonic dysfunction is a common reason for patients to seek medical care, although patients' perceptions may not reflect abnormal function. Abnormalities in colonic function can result from a primary disorder of the large intestine or from metabolic, neurologic, collagen vascular, neoplastic, or infectious diseases. Irritable bowel syndrome, a common disorder of colonic motility, can be caused by alterations in colonic neuromuscular functions, afferent neural function, or psychosocial factors. Colonic dysmotility can also result from malabsorption of carbohydrates. The most severe form of altered colonic motility is acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. Diagnostic studies should be limited to tests appropriate for the patient's symptoms and apparent severity of disease. Most motility disorders are functional disorders and do not result in abnormal studies. Pharmacotherapy should be directed by objective measures, the most useful of which are measurement of whole gut transit time and quantification of the water content of stools. Treatment should be determined by the nature of the disorder and the symptoms involved. For constipation, treatment should begin with changes in diet, fluid and fiber intake, and concurrent medications. Irritant laxatives can have damaging effects and should not be used habitually; however, polyethylene glycol-based purgatives can be helpful. Newer prokinetic agents, such as cisapride, have been shown to promote colonic motility. For selected patients with intractable constipation, surgery has a good success rate. For patients with functional diarrhea, opioid analogues can increase fluid absorption and delay transit.},

   abstract = {Gastrointestinal gas causes distress in many patients and their parents. Most often, patients do not have an actual increase in gastrointestinal gas volume, but rather their complaints derive from a misunderstanding of normal physiology, a misinterpretation of symptoms (colic), or an increase in intestinal sensitivity (irritable bowel syndrome). Symptoms from actual increases in intestinal gas volume are seen most frequently in children who swallow excessive amounts of air, have a dysmotility syndrome, or consume foods containing poorly absorbed carbohydrates. Although many therapies are used in the treatment of gas-related symptoms, under close scrutiny, the commonly recommended agents (e.g. simethicone) do not have proven efficacy. An understanding of the physiology of gas production and disposal is of practical use to pediatricians in determining the appropriate method of intervention for patients with these complaints.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is associated with motor abnormalities in the small intestine and colon. Neuropeptides may have an important role in initiating and regulating the intestinal motility. Motilin has been proposed to initiate the peristaltic reflex in the small intestine and cholecystokinin the gastrocolic reflex. METHODS: In 18 patients with IBS and 11 healthy control subjects plasma motilin and cholecystokinin (CCK) concentrations were measured after intraluminal stimulation of water and a fat-rich meal. RESULTS: The IBS patients had reduced motilin secretion after both water intake and the fat meal. In contrast, the fat meal elicited an exaggerated and prolonged CCK release in the IBS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Disturbed motilin and CCK release may partly be responsible for the intestinal dysmotility in the IBS patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a significant number of patients affected by the irritable bowel syndrome, an adverse reaction to food is proposed to be a causative factor. A diet that eliminates the offending foods is the obvious treatment for such adverse reactions. Compliance with a dietetic regimen is often poor and sometimes not completely free from risks. METHODS: Since the diarrheic type of irritable bowel syndrome seems mainly affected by food intolerance, and previous observations suggested that oral cromolyn sodium is effective in such patients, a multicenter therapeutic trial in the diarrheic type of irritable bowel syndrome was carried out in 346 of 409 patients with this disease, to evaluate the effects of oral cromolyn sodium and compare its efficacy with that of an elimination diet. RESULTS: Symptoms related to the irritable bowel syndrome improved in 60% of patients treated with elimination diet and in 67% of those treated with oral cromolyn sodium (1500 mg/day) for 1 month. Moreover, in both groups clinical results were significantly better in the patients positive to the skin prick test than in the negative ones. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the high prevalence of adverse reactions to foods in diarrheic irritable bowel syndrome and the usefulness of cromolyn sodium treatment in these patients.},

   abstract = {Lactose malabsorption may induce abdominal symptoms indistinguishable from those of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), however the exact relationship between the two conditions and the optimal differential diagnostic workup are still to be defined. We prospectively studied the prevalence of lactose malabsorption (by means of a hydrogen breath test) and the clinical effect of a long-term lactose-free diet in 230 consecutive patients with a suggested diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome, no organic disease of the GI tract, and no history of milk intolerance. Lactose malabsorption was diagnosed in 157 patients (68.2%). In 48 (43.6%) of the 110 patients who complied with the diet symptoms subsided, in 43 they were somewhat reduced and in 17 they remained unchanged. Symptoms never fully subsided in lactose malabsorbers non-compliant with the diet or in normal lactose absorbers who adhered to a lactose-free regimen. Partial improvement was observed in 20% of these subjects. No relation was demonstrated between pre-trial symptoms and the outcome of the diet. The occurrence of symptoms during the lactose breath test strongly suggested a favorable response to diet, but did not help in predicting whether symptoms would subside or be reduced. Conversely, their absence during the test was not associated with an acceptable negative predictive value. The high prevalence of lactose malabsorption in the patients under study suggests that in Italy IBS and lactose malabsorption are frequently associated. A test for diagnosing lactose malabsorption should always be included in the diagnostic workup for IBS and a long-term lactose-free regimen recommended if the test is positive.},

   abstract = {Survey questionnaires can be used to characterize normal bowel habits and the prevalence of bowel dysfunction. To determine whether ethnic and sex-related differences in bowel patterns exist between Hispanics and non-Hispanics whites, we conducted a survey of a nonpatient population in El Paso, on the U.S.-Mexico border. A forced-choice, self-report questionnaire was distributed to 1014 subjects and returned by 1000. Data from the 905 Hispanic and non-Hispanic white subjects were compared. Stool frequency was analyzed by multiple linear regression, and bowel dysfunction variables were analyzed by stepwise logistic regression, in ethnic and sex groups. Data were also analyzed controlling for age, socioeconomic status, dietary factors, and use of laxatives. There was a significant sex difference in mean number of stools per week reported (P < 0.0001): Hispanic males greater than Hispanic females (8.6 vs 7.5) and non-Hispanic white males greater than non-Hispanic white females (9.3 vs 7.2). The frequency of irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms was greater in females than in males (23.4% vs 9.6%, P < 0.001) and was less in Hispanics than non-Hispanic whites (16.9% vs 21.8%, P < 0.05), but a significant ethnic difference was not found after controlling for covariates. Additionally, females reported more alternating bowel pattern (44.0% vs 28.5%, P < 0.001) and constipation (25.5% vs 12.4%, P < 0.01) than males, and non-Hispanic white females more abdominal pain than the other subgroups (P < 0.05). Ethnic differences in dietary factors that may be relevant to bowel function were identified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},
