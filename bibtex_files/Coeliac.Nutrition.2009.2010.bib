   abstract = {Because celiac disease is greatly under-diagnosed in the United States, a common assumption is that U.S. doctors and researchers always have considered the condition extremely rare. However, the disorder captured widespread medical attention at the beginning of the twentieth century. Luther Emmett Holt, a leading pediatrician, encouraged three other doctors to investigate the condition. Two helped to associate celiac disease with elite medical institutions. The third linked it to the marketing efforts of the United Fruit Company. Interest in celiac declined after 1965, partly as a result of the decreased concern with nutrition and nutritional disorders.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Neurological manifestations of celiac disease are rare and polymorphic. Similar to lesions of the digestive tract, the standard treatment includes steroids. CASE REPORT: A 41-year-old woman, followed up for celiac disease resistant to gluten-free diet, developed rapidly spastic paraparesis, cerebellar syndrome, horizontal diplopia and decline of visual acuity. The diagnosis of neurological complications of celiac disease was established and the patient was treated with methylprednisolone, followed by oral prednisone. For 9 years, the patient's neurological status remained stabilized with a prednisone dose at 20mg per day. The patient relapsed when progressive reduction of prednisone dose was attempted; neurological and gastrointestinal signs worsening at 15mg per day; increasing the dose to 30mg improved the clinical status. DISCUSSION: The mechanism of onset of neurological disease remains unknown. Immunological, nutritional, toxic or metabolic factors could be involved. The positive response to corticosteroids observed in this patient suggest an immunological mechanism.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with or without fine needle aspiration (FNA) has a well-established role in the evaluation of various gastrointestinal (GI) tract disorders in adults. The clinical impact of EUS on the management of the pediatric population remains less clear. This study evaluates the feasibility, safety, and applications of EUS +/- FNA in pediatric GI tract disorders. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a prospectively maintained EUS database, all patients 18 years of age or younger referred for EUS at our institution were identified. Retrospective chart review was conducted to document procedure indications, type of anesthesia used, EUS findings, final FNA cytology results, and clinical impact of EUS +/- FNA on the subsequent management of pediatric patients. RESULTS: Fifty-eight EUS procedures were performed in 56 patients (35 girls). Median age was 16 years (range 4-18 years). The main indications for EUS were acute or recurrent pancreatitis, abdominal pain of suspected pancreatobiliary origin, suspected biliary obstruction, upper GI mucosal/submucosal lesions, and evaluation of pancreatic abnormalities seen on prior imaging. Sedation used included nurse-administered propofol sedation in 38 (73%), general anesthesia in 9 (17%), and fentanyl with meperidine in 3 (6%). Five therapeutic procedures performed included celiac plexus blocks in 4 and 1 EUS-guided pancreatogram. In 44 (86%) patients, EUS provided a new diagnosis. The procedure was successfully completed in all patients with no reported complications. CONCLUSIONS: EUS +/- FNA is feasible and safe and makes a significant impact on most pediatric patients. Nurse-administered propofol sedation appears to be safe and well tolerated in this group.},

The gluten-free products currently available in the market are considered of low quality and poor nutritional value. In the present study, the pseudocereals amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat were studied as potential healthy ingredients for improving the nutritional quality of gluten-free breads. The pseudocereal seeds and pseudocereal-containing gluten-free breads were evaluated in terms of their protein, fat, total starch, dietary fibre, ash and mineral content as well as their fatty acid composition. The pseudocereal containing gluten-free breads showed significantly higher levels of protein, fat, fibre and minerals than the control bread. The attributes of these breads conform to the expert's nutritional recommendations for the gluten-free diet and gluten-free foods. These results suggest that the pseudocereals amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat can represent a healthy alternative to frequently used ingredients in gluten-free products.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) occurs in as many as 1 in 80 pregnant women and is associated with poor pregnancy outcome, but it is not known if this is an effect on maternal nutrient absorption or, alternatively, if the placenta is an autoimmune target. The major autoantigen, tissue transglutaminase (tTG), has previously been shown to be present in the maternal-facing syncytiotrophoblast plasma membrane of the placenta. METHODS: ELISA was used to demonstrate the presence of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase in a panel of CD sera. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the binding of IgA autoantibodies from CD serum to term placenta. In addition, novel direct binding and activity assays were developed to mimic the in vivo exposure of the villous placenta to maternal autoantibody. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: CD IgA autoantibodies located to the syncytial surface of the placenta significantly more than IgA antibodies in control sera (P < 0.0001). The distribution of antigen was similar to that observed using a monoclonal antibody to tissue transglutaminase. Staining was reduced by pre-absorption of CD serum with recombinant human tissue transglutaminase. In direct binding assays, autoimmune immunoglobulin A (IgA) from the maternal compartment became associated with antigen at the syncytial surface of the placenta, as a result of which transglutaminase activity at this site was inhibited. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that direct immune effects in untreated CD women may compromise placental function.},

The main categories among orofacial clefts are isolated cleft palate and cleft lip with or without cleft palate. There have been many factors implicated in the development of the anomaly. The environmental factors which contribute and the genes which predispose to the condition remain obscure despite decades of research. Though it is generally agreed that folic acid deficiency is a contributory factor for non-syndromic cleft lip and palate, fewer concerns are directed towards the role for maternal/paternal nutrition in orofacial cleft origin. However, previously undescribed, here we consider the potential influence of maternal and paternal coeliac disease on the etiology of non-syndromic cleft lip and palate as an unfavorable pregnancy outcome. We postulated this relationship based on our observation, study and an empirical survey, and could be due either to (I) folic acid mal absorption (II) a genetically mediated genomic imprinting system.},

A further aim was to assess relationships between presentation patterns and nutrition in childhood CD. METHODS: The nutritional status of newly diagnosed CD was assessed by anthropometry, Bioelectrical Impedance and serum leptin levels, and contrasted to age and gender matched controls. RESULTS: Twenty-five children with CD (mean age of 8.2 +/- 4.5 years) and 25 control children (mean age 8.1 +/- 4.4.) were enrolled. Thirteen (52%) children with CD had gastrointestinal symptoms with 14 having a family history of CD. At presentation 8.7% were wasted, 4.2% were stunted and 20.8% overweight, although none were obese. Mean height and weight for age, other nutritional parameters and serum leptin did not differ between the groups. Serum leptin correlated with BMI in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Children with CD more commonly present with atypical symptoms than with classical features. Variations in nutrition (under to overnutrition) may be seen at diagnosis, without relationship to the presence of symptoms. Leptin levels were not altered specifically in the setting of CD. Nutritional assessment remains important in the assessment and management of CD in children.},

From September 2006 to March 2007 a nationwide questionnaire concerning current diagnostic methods was sent by mail to 54 Italian centres for the diagnosis of CD, which were distributed across the entire national territory. The questionnaire investigated the tests performed, diagnostic criteria currently used, and the management of some special cases in each centre. Eighty percent of the centres use anti-tissue transglutaminase to diagnose CD and anti-endomysium antibodies to confirm the results. Fifty-five percent still use anti-gliadin antibodies. A total of 87.5% of centres perform HLA typing, especially in first-degree relatives and in unclear diagnosis. Regarding histology, 67.5% of centres consider an infiltrative lesion consistent with diagnosis of CD. The majority of centres (85%) use the 1990 ESPGHAN criteria for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, but 80% do not perform a second biopsy in asymptomatic cases or a gluten challenge in children younger than 2 years of age. Furthermore, most centres (72.5%) do not prescribe a gluten-free diet to asymptomatic patients with positive serology and normal bowel architecture (ie, potential cases), but they do program a careful follow-up. In conclusion, ESPGHAN criteria are widely followed by Italian CD centres. However, their revision may be useful, but it should be evidence based. Large, multicentre studies are greatly needed.},

   abstract = {We sought to analyze the long-term growth in children with celiac disease (CD) as well as the association of height and weight SD score at the end of 4 years with the demographic and clinical presentation at initial admission. Thirty-four children with CD were enrolled in the study and followed for at least 4 years. Patients were divided into three groups (Group 1: patients <or=5 years old, Group 2: patients 5-10 years old, and Group 3: patients >10 years, at the time of diagnosis). Patients' charts were reviewed for demographic and clinical features at initial admission. Anthropometric measurements at initial admission, at 6th months, and 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years were recorded. Gluten-free diet led to rapid increase in weight SD and height SD score in patients <or=5 years old at the time of diagnosis (Group 1). Increment in height SD score was the highest in patients 5-10 years old (Group 2) at the end of 4 years. A negative correlation was found between age at the time of diagnosis and weight and height SD score at the end of 4 years (r = -0.503, P = 0.03 and r = -0.554, P = 0.01). Multiple regression analysis revealed that height SD score at the end of the 4 years was associated with age at the time of diagnosis. The other factors had no effect on the weight and height SD score at the end of 4 years. Early diagnosis and good adhesion to a gluten-free diet are essential for long-term growth in CD. Celiac societies and the mass media must expand an effort to educate the community regarding the symptoms of the disease.},

METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved eight patients with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease known for at least 1 year. All patients were given a thorough interrogation specifying the regular monitoring of the two diseases and the quality of the observance of the diabetic dietary and gluten-free diet, as well as an assessment of impact of diabetes. RESULTS: the caloric intake in relation to the recommendations is very insufficient. Taking snack is not respected. There is also the consumption of certain foods containing gluten masked and regular consumption of sucrose by our patients despite a long-term evolution of diabetes (19 +/- 6 years) and celiac disease (11 +/- 7.8 years). Half of patients have degenerative complications of diabetes. CONCLUSION: In light of these results, a frequent evaluation of nutrition education in these patients and a psychological care seems necessary.},

   abstract = {A dietary interview performed by expert personnel is considered to be the most appropriate tool to check whether patients with coeliac disease follow a strict gluten-free diet. However, we currently have no straightforward and non-subjective method for performing such a dietary interview. We therefore developed a fast questionnaire based on four simple questions with a five-level score (0-IV). To verify whether our questionnaire is an efficient tool, we applied it to 168 coeliac patients (126 females and 42 males; mean age 42.4 (SD 12.9) years) on a gluten-free diet (median 82, 25th-75th percentile 50-108, range 15-389 months). The score we obtained was compared with the persistence of both villous atrophy and endomysial antibodies while on a gluten-free diet. A comparison with survival of the patients was also performed. Patients were interviewed over the phone by non-expert personnel. The questionnaire was completed in less than 1 min. The lowest results were significantly more frequent among the patients with a persistence of both villous atrophy and positive endomysial antibodies. Death risk was also significantly correlated with the lowest score results. We conclude that our questionnaire is a reliable and simple method of verifying compliance with a gluten-free diet.},

Buckwheat is a major ingredient in the daily diet of the celiac patients due to its gluten-free composition. In this research, gluten-free tarhana samples were prepared with buckwheat flour (BWF), rice flour and corn starch. Control tarhana was made of wheat flour. In gluten-free formulations, instead of wheat flour, 40% BWF, 30% rice flour and 30% corn starch in the first formulation and 60% BWF, 20% rice flour and 20% corn starch in the second formulation were handled. BWF substitution at a 60% level increased the ash and fat contents of tarhana samples, but affected the lightness value of the samples negatively. Potassium, magnesium and phosphorus contents of the gluten-free tarhana increased significantly (P <0.05) with increasing amount of BWF in the formulation. Sensory evaluation showed that BWF addition resulted in changes in consistency, taste, sourness and grittiness. Tarhana containing 40% BWF received the highest taste and overall acceptability scores.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Abdominal angina is usually caused by atherosclerotic disease, and other causes are considered uncommon. This is the first report of a case of abdominal angina secondary to neoplastic vascular stenosis caused by local recurrence of an adenocarcinoma of the papilla of Vater. CASE PRESENTATION: An 80-year-old woman of Caucasian origin presented with abdominal pain and diarrhea. She had undergone a pancreaticoduodenectomy for adenocarcinoma of the papilla of Vater four years earlier. Computed tomography revealed a mass surrounding her celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery. Her abdominal pain responded poorly to analgesic drugs, but disappeared when oral feedings were withheld. A duplex ultrasonography of the patient's splanchnic vessels was consistent with vascular stenosis. Parenteral nutrition was started and the patient remained pain free until her death. CONCLUSION: Pain relief is an important therapeutic target in patients with cancer. In this case, abdominal pain was successfully managed only after the ischemic cause had been identified. The conventional analgesic therapy algorithm based on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids had been costly and pointless, whereas the simple withdrawal of oral feeding spared the patient of the discomfort of additional invasive procedures and allowed her to spend her remaining days in a completely pain-free state.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease is associated with tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGAb) and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-risk alleles DQB1*02 and DQB1*0302. The aim was to estimate the proportion of undiagnosed celiac disease in children with HLA risk at 3 years of age. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From a population-based HLA-DQ screening study of newborns born between June 2001 and August 2004 in the southern part of Sweden, 6206 children with HLA-risk alleles were identified and asked to participate at a mean 3.3 +/- 0.4 years of age. As controls, 7654 children with HLA-nonrisk alleles were asked to participate. In all, 1620 (26.1%) children with HLA risk and 1815 (23.7%) controls were screened for tTGAb using radioligand-binding assays. Celiac disease was established by intestinal biopsy in children with a confirmed positive tTGAb test. RESULTS: Twenty-three children reported already having clinically diagnosed celiac disease and did not participate further. In children with HLA-risk genotypes, 73 of 1620 (4.5%, 95% CI 3.5%-5.5%) were tTGAb-positive compared with none of 1815 from the controls (P < 0.0001). Seventy-one children underwent biopsy (1 refused biopsy and 1 biopsy failed), of whom 56 of 1618 (3.5%, 95% CI 2.6%-4.4%) had damaged intestinal mucosa classified as celiac disease. The ratio between clinically and screening detected celiac disease in this study was 1:2.4 (23:56). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of clinically undetected celiac disease may be particularly high among 3-year-old children with HLA-DQB1*02 and DQB1*0302 in Sweden, where these 2 HLA-risk alleles frequently occur.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Low bone mineral density (BMD) is common in children and adolescents with celiac disease. Strict gluten-free diet (GFD) improves bone mineralization, even in 1 year. The effect of occasional gluten intake is not known. The aims of this study were to compare BMD and prevalence of low BMD in children and adolescents on strict and not strict GFD. METHODS: We measured BMD in 55 children and adolescents (strict GFD) with negative endomysium antibodies (EMA) in the last 2 years and in 19 (not strict GFD) with positive EMA at the time of the study. Lumbar, left hip and total body BMD were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Four-day weighted dietary protocols were obtained by means of a self-completed questionnaire of total food and beverage intake. Energy and calcium intake were calculated using nutrition data software. EMA, tissue transglutaminase antibodies, serum calcium, phosphate, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, intact parathormone, albumin, urea and creatinine levels were determined in all patients. RESULTS: BMD in patients on strict GFD was significantly higher than in patients on not strict GFD (lumbar p=0.01; total body p=0.005). There were significantly more patients with total body BMD below -1.0 in not strictly compliant group (71% compared to 38%; p=0.03). Calcium intake and vitamin D levels were below recommendations in both groups. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents on not strict GFD are at increased risk for low BMD. We therefore recommend that BMD should be evaluated in patients with positive EMA. In addition, patients on strict GFD are at risk for low BMD because of low calcium intake or vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, strict GFD with recommended calcium intake and vitamin D supplementation during winter and spring should be encouraged in all children and adolescents with celiac disease.},

Although many factors contribute to this situation, one yet to be explored is malabsorption. We therefore aimed to assess nutritional status as well as the prevalence of altered mucosal permeability and celiac disease among a group of elderly patients presenting for rehabilitation. Forty-eight subjects were recruited (16 females) with a mean age of 83.7 (SD 6.1), body mass index 21.8 kg/m(2) (SD 3.9), mini-nutritional assessment (MNA) 19.5 (SD 3.4). They had no current gastrointestinal symptoms and undertook an assessment of mucosal permeability using the dual sugar absorption test of lactulose (7.5 g) and rhamnose (1 g). Ten of the 48 subjects had increased mucosal permeability with an L:R ration ranging from 0.0860 to 7.706 (N 0.01-0.08). These subjects were all at risk or malnourished according to the MNA score and they had a significantly lower mean MNA score of 17.2 (SD 3.5) compared to normal absorbers with a mean of 19.5 (SD 3.4). Two of the subjects had positive tissue trans-glutaminase antibodies. The higher risk of potential malabsorption in this elderly population has significant implications both for nutritional supplementation and for drug absorption as well as being a possible major contributor to malnutrition.},

   abstract = {Two adaptive homeostatic mechanisms normally preserve mucosal integrity: (i) immune exclusion mediated by secretory antibodies to inhibit penetration of potentially dangerous microorganisms and proteins, and (ii) immunosuppression to counteract hypersensitivity against innocuous antigens. The latter mechanism is called 'oral tolerance' when induced via the gut. Similar mechanisms are suppressive against commensal bacteria. Such two-layered anti-inflammatory defense explains why persistent allergy to dietary proteins is not more common, with the exception of gluten intolerance (celiac disease) where abrogation of mucosal homeostasis is overt. Thus, mucosally induced tolerance is generally a robust adaptive mechanism in view of the fact that a ton of food may pass annually through the gut of an adult - regularly giving rise to uptake of intact dietary antigens in the nanogram range after a meal. However, the immunoregulatory network and the epithelial barrier are poorly developed in the neonatal period, which therefore is critical with regard to priming for allergy. Notably, the postnatal development of mucosal immune homeostasis depends on appropriate microbial colonization. In this process, antigen-presenting cells are 'decision makers', linking innate and adaptive immunity. Their microbe-sensing function is influenced by both microbial products and dietary constituents, including vitamin A and lipids such as polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids.},

Human caseins were not recognized by IgA, whereas IgA reactivity of G2 and G3 was higher to bovine milk caseins. Immunoreactivity of G1 to yogurt caseins was lower and comparable to controls, with no effects due to mTG treatment. However, mTG treatment increased reactivity of G3 to wheat and maize prolamins. IgA immunoreactivity of CD patients to caseins and mTG-treated or not prolamins was age-dependent, which could reflect a differential manifestation of the effects of such proteins on the intestinal barrier.},

   abstract = {IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Increased expression and activity of transglutaminase 2 - a calcium-dependent enzyme which catalyzes protein cross-linking, polyamination or deamidation at selective glutamine residues - are involved in the etiopathogenesis of several pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune diseases and inflammatory diseases. Inhibition of enzyme activity has potential for therapeutic management of these diseases. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The major results achieved in the last twelve years of research in the field of inhibition of tranglutaminase activity using cell cultures as well as in vivo models of high-social-impact or widespread diseases, such as CNS neurodegenerative disorders, celiac sprue, cancer and fibrotic diseases. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Beneficial effects of enzyme activity inhibition have been observed in neurodegeneration and fibrosis in vivo models by delivery of the competitive inhibitor cystamine and more recently designed inhibitors, such as thiomidaziolium or norleucine derivatives, which irreversibly bind the active site cysteine residue. Transglutaminase 2 targeting with specific antibodies has also been shown to be a promising tool for celiac disease treatment. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: New insights from transglutaminase inhibition studies dealing with side effects of in vivo administration of pan-transglutaminase inhibitors will help in design of novel therapeutic approaches to various diseases.},

   abstract = {Inflammation is a stereotypical physiological response to infections and tissue injury; it initiates pathogen killing as well as tissue repair processes and helps to restore homeostasis at infected or damaged sites. Acute inflammatory reactions are usually self-limiting and resolve rapidly, due to the involvement of negative feedback mechanisms. Thus, regulated inflammatory responses are essential to remain healthy and maintain homeostasis. However, inflammatory responses that fail to regulate themselves can become chronic and contribute to the perpetuation and progression of disease. Characteristics typical of chronic inflammatory responses underlying the pathophysiology of several disorders include loss of barrier function, responsiveness to a normally benign stimulus, infiltration of inflammatory cells into compartments where they are not normally found in such high numbers, and overproduction of oxidants, cytokines, chemokines, eicosanoids and matrix metalloproteinases. The levels of these mediators amplify the inflammatory response, are destructive and contribute to the clinical symptoms. Various dietary components including long chain omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidant vitamins, plant flavonoids, prebiotics and probiotics have the potential to modulate predisposition to chronic inflammatory conditions and may have a role in their therapy. These components act through a variety of mechanisms including decreasing inflammatory mediator production through effects on cell signaling and gene expression (omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, plant flavonoids), reducing the production of damaging oxidants (vitamin E and other antioxidants), and promoting gut barrier function and anti-inflammatory responses (prebiotics and probiotics). However, in general really strong evidence of benefit to human health through anti-inflammatory actions is lacking for most of these dietary components. Thus, further studies addressing efficacy in humans linked to studies providing greater understanding of the mechanisms of action involved are required.},

   abstract = {When the Gastroenterological Society of Australia (GESA) began 50 years ago there were very few pediatric gastroenterologists in the world. The 'Mother' of Paediatric Gastroenterology was Australian Charlotte ('Charlo') Anderson who established one of the world's first pediatric gastroenterology units in Melbourne in the early 1960s. Her earlier work in Birmingham had identified gluten as the component of wheat responsible for celiac disease and helped separate maldigestion (cystic fibrosis) and mucosal malabsorption. The first comprehensive textbook of Paediatric Gastroenterology was edited by Charlotte Anderson and Valerie Burke in 1975. Rudge Townley succeeded Charlotte Anderson in Melbourne and went on to further develop small bowel biopsy techniques making it a safe, simple, and quick procedure that led to much greater understanding of small bowel disease and ultimately the discovery of Rotavirus by Ruth Bishop et al. and subsequently to Rotavirus immunization. Australian Paediatric Gastroenterology subsequently developed rapidly with units being established in all mainland capital cities by the end of the 1970s. The Australian Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (AuSPGHAN) was established in the 1980s. Australians have contributed significantly in many areas of gastroenterology in infants, children, and adolescents including celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, liver disease, transplantation, gastrointestinal infection, allergy, indigenous health, inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal motility, and the development of novel tests of gastrointestinal function and basic science. There have also been major contributions to nutrition in cystic fibrosis, end-stage liver disease, and intestinal failure. The future of Australian Paediatric Gastroenterology is in good hands.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of the water-immersion technique during upper endoscopy in recognizing the duodenal villous pattern in a series of children who were undergoing endoscopy to obtain duodenal biopsy for histological analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The water-immersion technique was performed in 19 children. Endoscopic findings were compared with histology. Results were assessed on per biopsy analysis and per patient analysis, taking into account the worst endoscopic finding in each patient and correlating it with the worst histological diagnosis. RESULTS: Per biopsy analysis: A total of 57 biopsy specimens were obtained and assessed. The endoscopic duodenal investigation correctly identified 53 areas (93%), which corresponded to histology, giving it an accuracy rate of 93%. Per patient analysis: The worst histology of the duodenal bulb was predicted by endoscopy in 18 of the 19 enrolled patients (95%), whereas the worst histopathological lesion of the second portion of the duodenum was recognized in 100% of cases. On the whole, therefore, the endoscopist suggested a diagnosis of celiac disease in 11 patients, with both positive and negative predictive values of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The water-immersion technique during upper endoscopy is highly accurate in recognizing the duodenal villous pattern in subjects who need a duodenal investigation. Our findings encourage a cost-saving and patient-retaining approach to the diagnosis of celiac disease by driving biopsy and reducing the number of duodenal samplings.},

Children may attain normal peak bone mass if the diagnosis is made and treatment is given before puberty, thereby preventing osteoporosis in later life. A GFD improves, but rarely normalizes, BMD in patients diagnosed with CD in adulthood. In some cases, nutritional supplementation may be necessary.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Light-to-moderate liver damage is often seen in children diagnosed with celiac disease, but severe liver damage is rarely observed. METHODS: During a 12-year-long period our center took care of six 13-36-month-old girls who developed severe liver damage 1-24 months after the diagnosis of celiac disease. RESULTS: Four girls had acute liver failure; two of them had to be liver transplanted. The other four girls recovered without transplantation and none of the six patients developed autoimmune disease during the 2-14-year-long follow-up period. Although adenovirus type 2 was found in the urine and stools of one girl, her liver histopathology did not resemble viral hepatitis. Certain autoimmune features could be observed initially in some of the children but finally none of them fulfilled the criteria for autoimmune liver disease and this pattern did not change during the several years of follow-up. Thorough investigation could not find any alternative pathogenetic cause and thus, the association with celiac disease is obvious. Histopathology showed various degrees of intralobular inflammation, necrosis, involvement of the small bile ducts, and in one case interface hepatitis; but in general, histopathology did not reveal a common pathogenetic mechanism. CONCLUSION: Although rare, severe hepatic damage or failure can develop in association with celiac disease. The etiology is varying and multifactorial. Consequently, children with newly onset celiac disease should be routinely checked for liver function and vice versa, children with severe liver damage should be investigated for untreated celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immunological disorder caused by intolerance to ingested gliadin and other cereal prolamins that has been included in the T(H)1-dominated group of diseases, where IL-12 induced IFNgamma is the major proinflamatory signal. Recently, another linage of T cells has been described, namely T(H)17, characterized by production of IL-17, that differentiate in response to TGFbeta and IL-6 and participate in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases. Using RT-PCR analysis of gene expression, we analyzed the presence of T(H)1 (IL-12 and IFNgamma) and T(H)17 (TGFbeta, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-23) related cytokines in intestinal biopsies from CD patients with active disease compared to remission and from treated patients after acute, in vitro re-exposure to gliadin. Potent T(H)1 and T(H)17 responses were present in the active stage of the disease, whereas short incubation of normalized biopsies with gliadin did not increase the expression of the effector cytokines, although a tendency of upregulation for both T(H)1 and T(H)17 promoting factors was observed, suggestive of a reactivation of proinflammatory pathways. These results place CD into the group of autoimmune disorders in which T(H)17 cells also participate, although the relative importance of each T cell response and their role in the initial events of the disease need further investigation.},

   abstract = {Whether diet may influence autoimmunity has been the subject of many unsolved debates. Interestingly, growing evidence indicates a large overlap between the mechanisms controlling tolerance to dietary antigens and autoimmunity. To discuss these links, we will focus on two model human diseases. The first one is IPEX syndrome due to mutations in the X-linked foxp3 gene. Studies of this disease underscore the role of regulatory FOXP3+ T cells in controlling the reactivity against self antigens and the response to dietary proteins in humans. The second is celiac disease, a complex poly-genic disease where exposure to dietary wheat proteins can trigger an autoimmune-like attack of the intestine frequently associated with the onset of extra-digestive autoimmune disorders. In the later disease, recent work shed light on the mechanisms that drive the intestinal inflammatory response to gluten and suggests impairment of immunoregulatory mechanisms that control intestinal tolerance and autoimmunity. Yet the exact role of gluten in the pathogenesis of extra-intestinal autoimmunity has not been elucidated. Interestingly, recent work indicates that dietary factors, including vitamin A and breast milk feeding, can protect against the development of harmful responses to dietary proteins. It is unclear whether this protection can apply to the prevention of autoimmunity.},

METHODS: 30 and 18 faecal samples from untreated and treated CD patients and 25 and 8 biopsy samples from untreated and treated CD patients, respectively, were analysed. In addition, 30 faecal and 8 biopsy samples from control children were evaluated for comparative purposes. Gut bacterial groups were quantified by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Bacteroides and Clostridium leptum groups were more abundant in faeces and biopsies of CD patients than in controls regardless of the stage of the disease. E coli and Staphylococcus counts were also higher in faeces and biopsies of non-treated CD patients than in those of controls, but their levels were normalised after treatment with a GFD. Bifidobacterium levels were lower in faeces of both groups of CD patients and in biopsies of untreated CD patients compared to controls. Similar bacterial groups were related to CD in biopsies and faeces, indicating that faecal microbiota partly reflects that of the small intestine in CD patients, and could constitute a convenient biological index of this disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Duodenal and faecal microbiota is unbalanced in children with untreated CD and only partially restored after long-term treatment with a GFD, constituting a novel factor linked to this disorder.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong, T cell-mediated enteropathy, triggered by the ingestion of gluten and related prolamins in genetically susceptible subjects, resulting in minor intestinal mucosal injury, including villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia and intraepithelial lymphocytosis, and subsequent nutrient malabsorption. Although serological tests for antiendomysial (EMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) autoantibodies are used to screen and follow up on patients with CD, diagnostic confirmation is still based on the histological examination of the small intestinal mucosa. Although the small intestinal mucosa is the main site of the gut involved in CD, other mucosal surfaces (such as gastric, rectal, ileal, and esophageal) belonging to the gastrointestinal tract and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) can also be involved. A site that could be studied less invasively is the mouth, as it is the first part of the gastrointestinal system and a part of the GALT. Indeed, not only have various oral ailments been reported as possible atypical aspects of CD, but it has been also demonstrated that inflammatory changes occur after oral supramucosal application and a submucosal injection of gliadin into the oral mucosa of CD patients. However, to date, only two studies have assessed the capacity of the oral mucosa of untreated CD patients to EMA and anti-tTG antibodies. In this paper, we will review studies that evaluate the capacity of the oral mucosa to produce specific CD autoantibodies. Discrepancies in sensitivity from the two studies have revealed that biopsy is still not an adequate procedure for the routine diagnostic purposes of CD patients, and a more in-depth evaluation on a larger sample size with standardized collection and analysis methods is merited. However, the demonstration of immunological reactivity to the gluten ingestion of the oral mucosa of CD, in terms of IgA EMA and anti-tTG production, needs to be further evaluated in order to verify whether the oral mucosa is colonized by lymphocytes activated in the intestine or if gluten could stimulate naive lymphocytes directly in the oral mucosa. This would have important implications for the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Numerous studies have reported a strong relationship between plasma leptin concentration and percentage of body fat, fat mass, and body mass index (BMI) in obese and non-obese children. The objective of the present study was to assess the usefulness of serum leptin concentration in disclosing prepubertal malnutrition. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Leptin concentrations in serum were determined and anthropometric parameters were measured in 149 children (3-6 and 7-10 years old). The Cole index of nutritional status was calculated. 44 children (I) presented with long-standing malnutrition due to celiac disease or food allergy and 105 children (II) were healthy. RESULTS: Leptin concentrations in both age groups of undernourished boys (median 2.7 and 2.7 microg/L) and in younger undernourished girls (median 4.2 microg/L) did not differ from concentrations in healthy children (median 2.9, 2.9, and 3.4 microg/L, respectively). Leptin concentrations in older undernourished girls were significantly lower than in healthy girls (median 4.2 vs. 8.8 microg/L, respectively; p < 0.05) of comparable age. In healthy children, leptin levels correlated with gender, body mass, BMI, Cole ratio (r = 0.39-0.41, r = 0.33, r = 0.28, r = 0.22, respectively; p < 0.005), and height (r = 0.19; p < 0.05). Serum leptin concentrations in undernourished children correlated with gender, arm circumference, and BMI (r = 0.27-0.35, r = 0.27, r = 0.25, respectively; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that serum leptin concentration is not a useful indicator of mild and moderate malnutrition in prepubertal children.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We analysed whether the quantification of autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase could be used to predict mucosal destruction and disease severity in patients with gluten sensitivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy patients with coeliac disease (CD), comprising 52 children with severe malabsorption (group I), 59 children with mild symptoms (group II), 59 adults (group III), 134 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and 131 disease controls, were studied. Serial serum samples of patients in groups I and II on a gluten-free diet were also included. Serum levels of antibodies against recombinant tissue transglutaminase were determined with ELISA using standard curves for quantification of antibodies. RESULTS: Immunoglobulin (Ig)A antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (IgA-TGA) were detected in all of the patients with CD and in 95% of the DH patients. The IgA-TGA and IgG-TGA levels were higher in group I (P < 0.001). The IgG-TGA levels and positivity rate in group I (100%) were higher than in group II (81%), group III (73%), and the DH group (67%). Elevated IgA-TGA and IgG-TGA levels in combination predicted a more severe small intestinal atrophy (P < 0.0001) with a specificity of 99% for Marsh IIIb-IIIc (flat) lesions. The kinetics of the IgA-TGA decrease during diet differed between groups I and II. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of IgA-TGA and IgG-TGA antibodies were associated with the grade of mucosal villous atrophy and a more severe clinical presentation. The combined measurement of IgA-TGA and IgG-TGA enables a noninvasive prediction of small intestinal villous atrophy with high accuracy, and may reduce the need for a biopsy in patients with suspected CD.},

The method was applied to the determination of free and bound fumonisins in several gluten-free products from the Italian market. Free fumonisins were found to occur in 90% of the samples: the overall median value was below the EU legal limit for foods for human consumption (800 microg/kg). Nonetheless, fumonisins occurred in several samples at concentrations above the legal limit, reaching also very strong contamination levels (maximum concentration level: 3310 microg/kg). Anyway, considering the limited diet of people suffering of the celiac disease or allergic to other wheat proteins, the incidence of fumonisin contamination may be envisaged as problematic. Furthermore, bound fumonisins were found to be present in all the analysed samples at similar or even higher amounts than the free forms. In many cases the sum of free and bound fumonisins exceeded the EU legal limit for total fumonisins also for those samples characterized by a low contamination of free fumonisins, thus opening a new important task to be addressed for the risk assessment in this field.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a serious condition affecting millions of individuals. Those afflicted with this illness are resigned to a lifelong avoidance of products containing the storage prolamin proteins found in cereal grains wheat, rye, and barley. Since many food products are based on these cereals, especially wheat, celiac patients have very limited food choices, and those that are available to them are generally poor in quality, often nutritionally deficient, and expensive. Furthermore, this condition also indirectly affects their families and friends with whom they share meals. Thus, a burgeoning need exists to develop nutritious, palatable, and affordable foods, especially staples like bread and pasta, for these individuals and their families and friends who are accustomed to wheat based products. Grain sorghum and its proteins are safe for celiac patients and individuals with varying levels of gluten intolerances. However, the main sorghum proteins, kafirins, are resistant to digestion. They are also difficult to extract and modify in an industrial-scale process and with food-compatible chemicals, thus limiting their use in foods. This review describes studies on kafirin extraction and methods for modifying sorghum proteins for improved nutrition and functionality, as well as food applications. Armed with this knowledge, scientists and technologists will be in a better position to identify opportunities that will further enhance the nutritional and functional value of sorghum proteins.},

These effects were also evaluated in cocultures of PBMCs and Caco-2 cells. The Gram-negative bacteria induced higher secretion of Th1-type proinflammatory cytokines (IL-12 and/or IFN-gamma) than the Bifidobacterium strains. Shigella CBD8 and E. coli CBL2 up-regulated mainly HLA-DR and CD40 expression involved in Th1 activation, and Bifidobacterium strains up-regulated CD83 expression. Specific interactions among the studied bacteria, gliadins, and IFN-gamma, which favored the CD immune features, were also detected. Therefore, intestinal bacteria could be additional factors that regulate the ability of monocytes recruited to the mucosa to respond to gliadins and IFN-gamma in CD patients, influencing the course of the disease.},

Coeliac disease (CD) is a permanent intolerance to cereal gluten proteins and the only therapy for the patients is to adhere to a life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). In the present preliminary study, the effects of a GFD on the composition and immune function of the gut microbiota were analysed in ten healthy subjects (mean age 30.3 years) over 1 month. Faecal microbiota was analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The ability of faecal bacteria to stimulate cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was determined by ELISA. No significant differences in dietary intake were found before and after the GFD except for reductions (P = 0.001) in polysaccharides. Bifidobacterium, Clostridium lituseburense and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii proportions decreased (P = 0.007, P = 0.031 and P = 0.009, respectively) as a result of the GFD analysed by FISH. Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium longum counts decreased (P = 0.020, P = 0.001 and P = 0.017, respectively), while Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli counts increased (P = 0.005 and P = 0.003) after the GFD assessed by qPCR. TNF-alpha, interferon-gamma, IL-10 and IL-8 production by PBMC stimulated with faecal samples was also reduced (P = 0.021, P = 0.037, P = 0.002 and P = 0.007, respectively) after the diet. Therefore, the GFD led to reductions in beneficial gut bacteria populations and the ability of faecal samples to stimulate the host's immunity. Thus, the GFD may constitute an environmental variable to be considered in treated CD patients for its possible effects on gut health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a chronic intestinal inflammatory disorder due to an aberrant immune response to dietary gluten proteins in genetically predisposed individuals. Mucosal immune response through IgA secretion constitutes a first line of defence responsible for neutralizing noxious antigens and pathogens. The aim of this study was the characterization of the relationships between immunoglobulin-coated bacteria and bacterial composition of faeces of coeliac disease (CD) patients, untreated and treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD) and healthy controls. RESULTS: IgA-coated faecal bacterial levels were significantly lower in both untreated and treated CD patients than in healthy controls. IgG and IgM-coated bacterial levels were also significantly lower in treated CD patients than in untreated CD patients and controls. Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria ratio was significantly reduced in both CD patients compared to controls. Bifidobacterium, Clostridium histolyticum, C. lituseburense and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii group proportions were less abundant (P < 0.050) in untreated CD patients than in healthy controls. Bacteroides-Prevotella group proportions were more abundant (P < 0.050) in untreated CD patients than in controls. Levels of IgA coating the Bacteroides-Prevotella group were significantly reduced (P < 0.050) in both CD patients in comparison with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: In CD patients, reduced IgA-coated bacteria is associated with intestinal dysbiosis, which altogether provide new insights into the possible relationships between the gut microbiota and the host defences in this disorder.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent intolerance to wheat prolamins and related proteins displayed by genetically susceptible individuals. Blocking or modulation of CD-specific T cell response by altered prolamin peptides are currently considered as a potential alternative to the only effective therapy of CD based on a life-long gluten-free diet. Two prolamin peptides, the 9-mer ASRVAPGQQ and the 10-mer GTVGVAPGQQ sequences, were identified by mass spectrometry in the peptic/tryptic digest of prolamins (PTP) from durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) cv. Adamello, and investigated for their ability to preclude the stimulation of CD-specific mucosal T cells by gluten proteins. METHODS: Gluten-specific polyclonal intestinal T cell lines from five CD children (mean age 5 years) were exposed to 50 microg/ml of a deamidated PTP from whole flour of common wheat (T. aestivum) cv. San Pastore, and tested for proliferation and production of interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). The same experiment was performed in the presence of 20 microg/ml of the 9-mer or the 10-mer peptide. RESULTS: T cells exposed to PTP showed a threefold increase in proliferation and INF-gamma production, and a significant (P <or= 0.05) reduction in IL-10 secretion as compared with control cells incubated with the culture medium. Addition of either the 9-mer or the 10-mer peptide to PTP downregulated T cell proliferation and INF-gamma production, and caused a significant (P <or= 0.05) increase in IL-10 secretion. CONCLUSIONS: The T cell reactivity elicited by PTP is precluded by both the 9-mer and the 10-mer sequence, suggesting that over-expression of these proteolytically stable peptides may result in a wheat flour with reduced toxicity for CD patients.},

An informatic tool (ALIM V 1.0) developed by the authors, was used for the formulation of these foods. The obtained products were pancakes, scons, precooked pizza and bread which were analyzed in their chemical composition (protein, fat, fiber, moisture, ash and carbohydrates). Water activity (aw), acceptability and texture parameters (hardness, gumminess, chewiness, adhesiveness and cohesiveness) were also determined. Commercial products (C) were taken as reference and were performed the same analysis to formulated products (F). Significant differences were found in protein, fat moisture, ash and fiber content and in most of the texture parameters studied in both food groups (p<0.05). In pancakes and scones (F) was observed an increase of protein of 88 and 198% respectively, while prepizza and bread (F) showed lower contents (8 and 22%) respect to their commercial pairs, however all products (F) have Chemical Scores higher to 100. The aw of products (F) and (C), gave values similar to the data cited on bibliography for analogous products. The formulations more acceptable (values over 80%) were scones and pancakes. Overall, the formulated products provide good quality proteins, have good textural characteristics and adequate percentages of acceptability to be used in the feeding of celiac patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND GOALS: In the clinical management of celiac disease, new noninvasive tools for evaluation of intestinal damage are needed for diagnosis and for follow-up of diet effects. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) are potentially useful for this purpose as these are small cytosolic proteins present in enterocytes and sensitive markers for intestinal mucosal damage. First, the distribution and microscopic localization of FABP in the healthy human intestine was examined. Second, levels of circulating FABP were measured in patients with celiac disease before and after introducing a gluten-free diet (GFD) and in healthy controls. STUDY: The distribution and microscopic localization of FABP in normal human intestinal tissue was assessed using surgical intestinal specimens of 39 patients. Circulating levels of intestinal (I)-FABP and liver (L)-FABP were determined in 26 healthy volunteers and 13 patients with biopsy proven celiac disease. Ten of these patients were reevaluated within 1 year after starting GFD. RESULTS: I-FABP and L-FABP are predominantly present in the small intestine, mainly the jejunum. Moreover, FABP are expressed in cells on the upper part of the villi, the initial site of destruction in celiac disease. Circulating levels of FABP are significantly elevated in untreated patients with biopsy proven celiac disease compared with healthy controls (I-FABP: 784.7 pg/mL vs. 172.7 pg/mL, P<0.001; L-FABP: 48.4 ng/mL vs. 10.4 ng/mL, P<0.001). In response to GFD, these concentrations normalize. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this pilot study strongly suggest that FABP can be used as a noninvasive method for assessment of intestinal damage in celiac disease. Besides an additional role in the diagnosis of celiac disease, FABP potentially enable noninvasive monitoring of the GFD effects.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed at showing the safety, for young patients with celiac disease (CD), of sweet baked goods made of wheat flour, which was rendered gluten-free during sourdough fermentation. METHODS AND RESULTS: As shown by R5 antibody-based sandwich and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), selected lactobacilli and fungal proteases, routinely used in bakeries, degraded gluten to <10 ppm during sourdough fermentation. The resulting flour was mainly a mixture of water-/salt-soluble low-size peptides and free amino acids. Gliadin and glutenin fractions extracted from the pepsin-trypsin (PT) digest of the fermented wheat flour induced the expression of interferon (IFN)-gamma at the level comparable with the negative control. After fermentation, the wheat flour was spray dried and used for making sweet baked goods. Eight patients with CD in remission were enrolled for the clinical challenge, and they daily consumed 200 g of sweet baked goods equivalent to 10 g of native gluten. Hematology, serology (total serum IgA, IgG and IgA antigluten, endomysial and tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies), and intestinal permeability analyses were carried out over time. One patient interrupted the trial after 15 days and another after 30 days only due to difficulties in the compliance of the daily consumption. All of the other patients showed normal values of hematology, serology, and intestinal permeability during 60 days of challenge. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a wheat flour-fermented product, having gluten completely degraded, is not toxic for patients with CD. Nevertheless, these foods should not be recommended for patients with celiac disease until a formal trial has been done.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD), traditionally perceived as a rare childhood condition presenting with malabsorption, is instead an autoimmune multisystem disorder usually presenting in adulthood, affecting > or = 1% of the population and linked to the genetic expression of human leucocyte antigens (HLA) DQ2 and DQ8. Presentation occurs most often in the 40-60 years age-group, but potentially at any age. Symptoms attributable to the gut or to malabsorption may be mild, non-specific or absent; under one-third of patients have diarrhoea and almost half are overweight. Histological diagnosis no longer requires small intestine villous atrophy. The Marsh classification recognizes increased intraepithelial lymphocytes and crypt hyperplasia with intact villi as part of the gluten enteropathy spectrum, while some individuals have more subtle abnormalities identified only on electron microscopy. Serological testing for CD autoantibodies (to endomysium and tissue transglutaminase) has revolutionized diagnosis, shifting the process towards primary care. However, a substantial number of patients with CD are seronegative, particularly those without villous atrophy. The autoantibody to endomysium may be produced before histological change. The immune response to transglutaminase is crucial to the disease process. An exciting new development is the link between antibodies to organ-specific transglutaminases and clinical presentation; transglutaminases 2 (gut), 3 (skin) and 6 (nervous system). Negative testing for CD does not preclude its development later and HLA testing may allow 'once and for all' exclusion. In conclusion, an increasing proportion of patients with CD do not meet the 'classic' picture of malabsorption, positive serological testing and villous atrophy. Insisting on all these criteria for diagnosis will result in under diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease presents with a spectrum of clinical disorders. The variety of clinical presentations largely depends on age and extraintestinal findings. This study aimed to determine typical and atypical cases according to presenting symptoms and to evaluate their biochemical and pathological parameters. METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with celiac disease in our unit between 2000 and 2007 were reviewed. Their diagnosis was made by serological and histological examination. The patients were divided into two groups according to their typical or atypical symptoms. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients at diagnosis was 8.2 years (range, 1-18 years), but patients presenting with typical symptoms were younger than those presenting with atypical symptoms. The patients in the two groups did not differ significantly in sex, weight and height Z scores except age. Diarrhea (96.3%), abdominal distention (65.4%) and failure to thrive (60%) were the most common clinical presentations in the typical group, and short stature (62.5%) and anemia (31.2%) were the most common in the atypical group. Total/subtotal villous atrophy was significantly higher in the typical group than in the atypical group. CONCLUSIONS: Many children with celiac disease show an atypical form. The understanding of presentations of celiac disease may prevent delayed diagnosis. Celiac disease should be specially investigated in patients with recurrent iron deficiency anemia, short stature and autoimmune disorders.},

   abstract = {The term oral (or mucosal) tolerance has been classically defined as the suppression of T- and B-cell responses to an antigen by prior administration of the antigen by the oral route. In recent years, it has become clear that both innate and acquired regulatory immune responses are essential for the development of oral tolerance. As such, mucosal microenvironmental factors such as transforming growth factor- beta, prostaglandins but also dietary vitamin A create conditioning of an adaptive regulatory T-cell response that suppresses subsequent antigen-specific responses. Particular resident subsets of antigen presenting dendritic cells are pivotal to convey conditioning signals next to the presentation of antigen. This review discusses the primary mechanisms of adaptive regulatory T-cell induction to ingested soluble protein antigen. However, we also discuss the limitations of our knowledge with respect to understanding the very common food hypersensitivity Celiac disease caused by an aberrant adaptive immune response to the food protein gluten.},

The aim of this work was to systemically determine the overall diagnostic characteristics of VCE in diagnosing noncomplicated CD, compared to the gold standard, using meta-analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An extensive literature search was performed looking for prospective, controlled trials, with investigators blinded to results of the pathology of small-bowel biopsies. Two independent authors performed data extraction and assessment of the methodologic quality of each trial. Diagnostic characteristics of each trial were collected, and pooled sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratios were computed. Description of complications and costs was included, if reported. RESULTS: A total of three studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 107; 63 with CD and 44 without). The overall pooled VCE sensitivity was 83% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 71-90%) and specificity was 98% (95% CI = 88-99.6%). No major complications were reported. The costs were mentioned only in one study. CONCLUSIONS: The overall diagnostic characteristics of VCE, when used to diagnose celiac disease, though good with an experienced eye, could not justify the routine use of VCE as an alternative to the pathology of small-bowel biopsies. More studies are needed with proper cost-benefit analysis.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To identify risk as well as protective factors related to compliance with the gluten-free diet in a cohort of teenagers with celiac disease (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred four patients with CD (European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition criteria) older than or equal to 13 years and residents of Campania (southern Italy) were enrolled in the study. Patients underwent clinical examination and blood sampling, and were interviewed about school performance, social relationships, family integration, smoking habit, and compliance with a gluten-free diet. Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies were assayed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: One hundred fifty of 204 (73.5%) reported no dietary transgressions, and 54 of 204 (26.5%) reported occasional or frequent transgressions. During the previous month 29 of 54 (53.7%) poor compliers ate from 0.001 to 1 g of gluten per day, 14 (25.9%) from 1 to 5 g, and 11 (20.4%) more than 5 g. The daily intake of gluten was significantly related to anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (chi2 = 38.872, P = 0.000). Height was below the third percentile in 19 of 204 (9.3%), and weight was above the 97th percentile in 20 of 204 (9.8%). Diet compliance did not seem to influence the weight and height. One hundred eleven of 150 good compliers (74%) and 31 of 54 (57.4%) poor compliers were asymptomatic. Most patients reported good family relationships (88.7%), social relationships (91.2%), and school integration (88.2%). Alternatively, 54% of patients reported some limitation in their social life. Compliance was good in patients who reported excellent school integration (83%) and social relationships (81%). CONCLUSION: Optimal school integration significantly contributes to the likelihood of good compliance. A better understanding within the school environment about CD-related issues could improve motivation to adhere to a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong gluten-sensitive intestinal enteropathy that is multifactorial in its etiology. In the present study, we evaluated basic anthropometric, clinical, laboratory, and histological features of 140 Turkish children with CD. We particularly underscored the association of CD with other autoimmune diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the period from 1999 to 2005, CD was diagnosed in 140 children according to ESPGAN criteria. The age, gender, clinical findings, hematological, and biochemical parameters at diagnosis were noted. Symptoms and signs were recorded. Endoscopic intestinal biopsies were taken from all children. RESULTS: Of the 140 children with CD, 75 (53.6%) were female, and 65 (46.4%) were male. Mean age was 8.56 +/- 4.43 years (range 13 months to 18 years). The most frequent symptom was failure to thrive (81.4%), followed by chronic diarrhea (60%). Of the children with CD, nine (6.4%) had type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), six (4.3%) had familial Mediterranean fever, three (2.1%) had alopecia areata, three (2.1%) had vitiligo, three (2.1%) had Down syndrome, two (1.4%) had lung tuberculosis, two (1.4 %) had autoimmune hepatitis, two (1.4%) had growth hormone deficiency, one (0.7%) had osteogenesis imperfecta, and one (0.7%) had Floating Harbor Syndrome. Elevated serum levels of ALT, CK and AST were detected in 48(34.8%), 50 (38.2%) and 67 (48.6%) children, respectively. CONCLUSION: The spectrum of clinical findings is very wide. In order to avoid overlooking CD in patients with extra intestinal symptoms and signs, physicians, especially pediatricians, should be informed about new atypical manifestations of CD.},

BACKGROUND: As FC is regarded as a marker of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, we hypothesized that it might be increased in untreated CD. STUDY: The study included 29 newly diagnosed patients with CD (mean age: 6.6+/-0.6 y) and sex and age-matched 10 healthy children. All of the children with CD admitted to the hospital were classical form who has chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive. The degree of mucosal damage was graded according to the modified Marsh criteria. FC concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method on admission and after 1 year of GFD. RESULTS: Mean FC concentration of children with CD on admission and of healthy children were 13.40+/-8.5 and 4.3+/-3.3 mg/L, respectively (P=0.004). FC concentration under GFD was 4.6+/-2.7 mg/L and there was a significant statistical difference between untreated patients and those under GFD for 1 year (P=0.001). There was no statistical difference between FC concentration of those under GFD and healthy children (P=0.8). Mean FC concentrations of children with total-villous atrophy and partial-villous atrophy were significantly different (13.8+/-9.3 mg/L vs. 3.7+/-1.8 mg/L, P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: It was found that FC concentration is increased in childhood CD, related to the severity of histopathologic findings and responsive to GFD. The pathogenetic mechanism by which FC is increased in CD should be investigated in further studies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There is a relationship between nonresponsiveness to hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine and certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes. In healthy population, 4-10% vaccine recipients fail to produce protective levels of antibodies to the HBV vaccine after standard immunization depending upon age and the presence of various underlying diseases. Celiac disease (CD) is an HLA-associated immunological disease. It has been suggested that certain HLA haplotypes which are linked to CD are associated with nonresponse to HBV vaccine as well. The aim of this study is to assess the response to HBV vaccine prospectively in a group of CD and to explore the potential link between CD and HBV vaccine nonresponse by studying shared HLA haplotypes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-three previously diagnosed celiac patients who were on a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) and 54 healthy children were evaluated serologically for anti-HBs status. Celiac children who were anti-HBs negative at baseline were fully vaccinated prospectively, and reevaluated for the response to HBV vaccine. To estimate the role of HLA type in HBV vaccine response in celiac patients, a subgroup of both patients and control participants had HLA genotypes performed. RESULTS: At enrollment, 27 (67.5%) children with CD and 48 (85.2%) healthy children were anti-HBs positive, and the difference between patients and controls was statistically significant (P<0.05). However, failure to respond to HBV vaccine was only 3.6% (response rate 96.4%) in prospectively vaccinated celiac patients. There was no relationship between HLA type and vaccine nonresponse in our study group. CONCLUSION: The response to HBV vaccine in celiac children who were compliant to GFD is not different from a healthy population. CD may be one of the immune diseases associated with a high rate of HBV vaccine nonresponse but it might not be permanent and treatment with GFD and compliance to the treatment may ameliorate the immune response to HBV vaccine in celiac children.},

Definitions for non-responsive coeliac disease and refractory coeliac disease will be provided. The most common reason for recurrent symptoms is continued gluten exposure. Other causes of persisting symptoms are discussed, including alternative causes of villous atrophy or co-existent pathology. Current literature is reviewed, including an initial investigation strategy for patients with persisting symptoms. A pragmatic management plan is described that can be initiated by any clinician. Finally, the current optimal investigational pathway for patients with refractory (or suspected refractory) coeliac disease is discussed and the reported effects of a number of therapeutic options are summarised. The aim of the present article is to provide clinicians with an up-to-date review of the literature in this clinical field and allow them to determine the most appropriate management strategy.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: coeliac disease (CD) is a chronic disease of the small intestine, which is caused by gluten intolerance, producing malabsorption of nutrients and vitamins. Clinical manifestations of CD in adults are highly variable, including intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms. The disease may also occur in individuals who are asymptomatic. OBJECTIVE: our objective is to describe the incidence and clinical manifestations of CD in adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a retrospective study was carried out in patients diagnosed of CD between January 1990 and December 2008. Diagnosis was based on serologic tests and duodenal biopsy, which were compatible with CD in all of them. RESULTS: sixty eight adult patients were diagnosed of CD in this period. Mean age was 33 (18-65) years and 50 (74%) were women. The clinical manifestations were diarrhoea in 38 (55%), abdominal pain in 27 (40%), loss of weight in 15 (22%), dyspepsia in 13 (19%). Analytical results showed a slight increase of transaminases in 26 (38%), ferropenic anaemia in 33 (48.5%) cases, sub-clinical hypothyroidism in 3 (4.5%) patients, and folic acid deficiency in 16 (23.5%) cases. Almost all patients were diagnosed between 2000 and 2008: 60 (87%). Population-based incidence of CD in adults had increased from 0.7-2/100,000 per year in the nineties to 3.5-10.3/100,000 in the last years. CONCLUSIONS: CD can appear at any age and with a wide manifestation spectrum, which can be atypical in some cases. Patients with ferropenic anaemia and a negative response to treatment or those with an unexplained increase in transaminases should be screening for CD. Atypical manifestations and low suspect index can delay diagnosis even during years. There is a marked increase in the incidence-rates of CD in adults over time.},

   abstract = {Anemia is a frequent finding in most diseases which cause malabsorption. The most frequent etiology is the combination of iron and vitamin B12 deficiency. Celiac disease is frequently diagnosed in patients referred for evaluation of iron deficiency anemia (IDA), being reported in 1.8%-14.6% of patients. Therefore, duodenal biopsies should be taken during endoscopy if no obvious cause of iron deficiency (ID) can be found. Cobalamin deficiency occurs frequently among elderly patients, but it is often unrecognized because the clinical manifestations are subtle; it is caused primarily by food-cobalamin malabsorption and pernicious anemia. The classic treatment of cobalamin deficiency has been parenteral administration of the vitamin. Recent data suggest that alternative routes of cobalamin administration (oral and nasal) may be useful in some cases. Anemia is a frequent complication of gastrectomy, and has been often described after bariatric surgery. It has been shown that banding procedures which maintain digestive continuity with the antrum and duodenum are associated with low rates of ID. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection may be considered as a risk factor for IDA, mainly in groups with high demands for iron, such as some children and adolescents. Further controlled trials are needed before making solid recommendations about H. pylori eradication in these cases.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disorder of the gut in which innate and adaptive responses are involved. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 participate in host defense through antigen recognition, and show altered expression in CD gut mucosa. beta-defensins are inducible antimicrobial peptides, and DEFB gene copy number polymorphisms have been associated with autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. We performed copy number analysis of TLR2, TLR4, and the beta-defensin cluster (DEFB4, DEFB103 and DEFB104) by gene-specific, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 376 CD patients and 376 controls. TLR genes did not show copy number variation, and all samples presented with two copies. beta-defensin clusters varied between 2 and 9 copies per genome, and when grouped into bins, high copy numbers (>4) were underrepresented among patients (p = 0.023; odds ratio = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.50-0.96), suggesting that increased copy numbers could protect from CD, possibly by impeding bacterial infiltration more efficiently and preserving gut epithelial integrity.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease may be initially detected in either children or adults, even in the elderly. This small intestinal mucosal disorder is gluten-dependent and causes nutrient malabsorption, often with diarrhea and weight loss. Diagnosis depends on detection of typical biopsy changes in the proximal small bowel along with an unequivocal response to a gluten-free diet. Recurrent changes usually result from poor adherence to the gluten-free diet, sometimes intentional, or from consumption of unsuspected gluten sources. In others, the original diagnosis may not be correct (e.g., duodenal involvement with Crohn's disease) or another cause for symptoms may have supervened (e.g., collagenous colitis, functional bowel disease). Rarely, a complication may occur (e.g., collagenous sprue, lymphoma). In some, the gluten-dependent nature of the small bowel disorder was not initially documented and biopsy changes continued despite a gluten-free diet. These have a sprue-like intestinal disorder, also labeled unclassified sprue. This represents a small, but likely, heterogeneous group, and in these, intractable symptoms may be present and, in some, lymphoma is eventually diagnosed.},

Pathologically, a severe to variably severe "flattened" mucosal biopsy lesion with distinctive sub-epithelial deposits in the lamina propria region is detected. Histochemical stains and ultrastructural studies have confirmed that these deposits contain collagens. Often, an initial diagnosis of celiac disease is considered but no continued response to treatment with a gluten-free diet occurs. Recent reports indicate an intimate relationship between collagenous sprue and celiac disease, sometimes with concomitant T-cell enteropathy. In addition, permanent disappearance of these deposits after resection of a localized colon cancer suggested that this disorder could actually represent a paraneoplastic morphologic marker of an occult malignancy. Studies showing either gastric or colonic involvement (or both) with this unusual collagenous inflammatory mucosal process may also reflect a far more extensive and heterogeneous process than previously appreciated.},

Some of the reported response to celiac diets in children with autism may be related to amelioration of nutritional deficiency resulting from undiagnosed gluten sensitivity and consequent malabsorption. A case is presented of a 5-year-old boy diagnosed with severe autism at a specialty clinic for autistic spectrum disorders. After initial investigation suggested underlying celiac disease and varied nutrient deficiencies, a gluten-free diet was instituted along with dietary and supplemental measures to secure nutritional sufficiency. The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms rapidly resolved, and signs and symptoms suggestive of autism progressively abated. This case is an example of a common malabsorption syndrome associated with central nervous system dysfunction and suggests that in some contexts, nutritional deficiency may be a determinant of developmental delay. It is recommended that all children with neurodevelopmental problems be assessed for nutritional deficiency and malabsorption syndromes.},

Tissue transglutaminase was assessed immunohistochemically (clone CUB 7402) in duodenal biopsy specimens from 22 untreated CD patients, ten normal controls (NC) with unremarkable duodenal mucosa, and nine disease nonceliac controls (DC). In 15 CD patients duodenal biopsy specimens were repeatedly assessed after these patients had been prescribed gluten-free diet. Positive pixel count algorithm of ImageScope was used for quantitative evaluation of immunohistochemistry. Tissue transglutaminase expression in superficial epithelium differed significantly between the three groups (p < 0.001). It was increased in DC in relation to NC (p < 0.001) and in CD--in relation to NC (p < 0.001) and DC (p = 0.003). In CD and DC, cryptal epithelium was stained more intensively than in NC (p < 0.001), but there was no difference between CD and DC (p = 0.507). The same pattern was seen in lamina propria. A significant decrease in tTG expression in all the compartments was seen in repeatedly assessed samples. Untreated CD is associated with tTG overexpression, which is reversible. Tissue transglutaminase up-regulation does not seem to be specific for CD and can appear in other pathological conditions.},

To this aim we investigated Graziella Ra(R) and Kamut(R) (the latter is considered an ancient relative of modern durum wheat) in comparison to four durum wheat accessions (Senatore Cappelli, Flaminio, Grazia and Svevo). ELISA and Western Blot analyses - carried out by two monoclonal antibodies raised against the alpha-gliadin peptides p31-49 (LGQQQPFPQQPYPQPQPF) and p56-75 (LQLQPFPQPQLPYPQPQLPY) containing a core region (underlined) reported to be toxic for coeliac patients - always showed an antibody-antigen positive reaction. For all accessions, an alpha-gliadin gene has also been cloned and sequenced. Deduced amino acid sequences constantly showed the toxic motifs. In conclusion, we strongly recommend that coeliac patients should avoid consuming Graziella Ra(R) or Kamut(R). In fact their alpha-gliadin not only is as toxic as one of the other wheat accessions, but also occurs in greater amount, which is in line with the higher level of proteins in ancient wheats when compared to modern varieties.},

   abstract = {The intestinal epithelium is a single-cell layer that constitutes the largest and most important barrier against the external environment. It acts as a selectively permeable barrier, permitting the absorption of nutrients, electrolytes, and water while maintaining an effective defense against intraluminal toxins, antigens, and enteric flora. The epithelium maintains its selective barrier function through the formation of complex protein-protein networks that mechanically link adjacent cells and seal the intercellular space. The protein networks connecting epithelial cells form 3 adhesive complexes: desmosomes, adherens junctions, and tight junctions. These complexes consist of transmembrane proteins that interact extracellularly with adjacent cells and intracellularly with adaptor proteins that link to the cytoskeleton. Over the past decade, there has been increasing recognition of an association between disrupted intestinal barrier function and the development of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In this review we summarize the evolving understanding of the molecular composition and regulation of intestinal barrier function. We discuss the interactions between innate and adaptive immunity and intestinal epithelial barrier function, as well as the effect of exogenous factors on intestinal barrier function. Finally, we summarize clinical and experimental evidence demonstrating intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction as a major factor contributing to the predisposition to inflammatory diseases, including food allergy, inflammatory bowel diseases, and celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is a genetically driven immunological intolerance to dietary gluten with a wide range of clinical presentations. The aim of this study was to investigate the heritability of the phenotype in CD and the influence on the phenotype of different genes associated with the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and seven families with at least 2 siblings with CD were collected. The patients were grouped in symptom grades on the basis of the clinical presentation, the age at diagnosis, and sex. Stratification analyses of the human leucocyte antigen-DQA1 and human leucocyte antigen-DQB1 genotypes, the CTLA4 +49A/G polymorphism, the CTLA4 haplotype MH30*G:-1147*T:+49*A:CT60*G:CT61*A, and the 5q31-33 loci were done. RESULTS: The heritability of the phenotype was estimated to be 0.45. Significant association and linkage was found between the clinical presentation and the CTLA4 +49A/G polymorphism but not for the other genotypes. No correlation was found between genotypes and age at diagnosis or sex. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the heritability is determiner of the phenotype in CD. The CTLA4 +49A/G polymorphism is correlated to the clinical presentation: the AA genotype is associated with clinically silent disease.},

The postoperative condition including bowel movement, nutritional status, and tolerance to adjuvant chemotherapy has never been studied. METHODS: 40 patients who underwent DP-CAR were enrolled in this study. Postoperative bowel function was estimated by the requirement of anti-diarrheal agents. Changes of nutritional parameters including body weight and laboratory data for 1 year after surgery were evaluated. RESULTS: 15 (38%) patients needed no anti-diarrheal agent after a median follow-up period of 39 months. The other patients were well controlled for their bowel movement with anti-diarrheal drugs. 13 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy tolerated it well despite hematologic toxicity in 7 patients who received gemcitabine. Postoperative body weight was significantly decreased and reached a plateau value at postoperative month 3. The values of laboratory data indicating nutritional status were significantly lower at 1 month after surgery and recovered between 3 and 12 months. CONCLUSION: The patients who underwent DP-CAR scarcely suffered from intractable diarrhea and could achieve a feasible nutritional status after surgery to be able to receive adjuvant chemotherapy.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: In coeliac disease (CD) there is a gluten-induced small bowel enteropathy leading to malabsorption of various nutrients, vitamins and trace elements. Low levels of serum zinc have been reported in adults with untreated CD. In the present study we related the serum concentration of zinc to the morphology of the small bowel mucosa in 58 children, all under 4 years of age and under investigation for coeliac disease. The mean serum concentration of zinc (mean +/- SD; mumol/L) was significantly lower in children with untreated CD (9.7 +/- 2.0) (n = 11) compared to non-coeliac children without enteropathy (15.1 +/- 2.3) (n = 16) (p < 0.001), coeliac children on a gluten-free diet without enteropathy (14.2 +/- 1.6) (n = 14) (p < 0.001), coeliac children on gluten challenge with enteropathy (14.1 +/- 2.1) (n = 12) (p < 0.001) and coeliac children on gluten challenge without enteropathy (13.8 +/- 1.9) (n = 6) (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Serum zinc concentration is decreased in untreated coeliac children with enteropathy and normalizes on gluten-free diet. A low serum zinc value in a child being investigated for possible CD on clinical grounds can thus be used as a complementary marker for enteropathy indicating further investigation with small bowel biopsy. The hypothetical role of zinc in the pathogenesis of CD is discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: PreventCD (www.preventcd.com) is a European multicentre study, which studies the influence of infant nutrition, and that of genetic, immunologic and environmental factors, on the risk of developing coeliac disease (CD). The hypothesis is that it is possible to induce tolerance to gluten by introducing small quantities of gluten to infants, preferably while they are still being breast-fed, and that this might also reduce the risk for related autoimmune disorders. AIM: To describe the design of this ongoing European CD research project. METHODS: PreventCD encompasses two study designs and two study populations: (i) a European multicentre study: a prospective, double-blind, randomized dietary-intervention study among infants from families with high risk of CD, and (ii) a Swedish population-based CD screening study among 12-year-olds from the general population, divided into two birth cohorts that differ with respect to infant feeding practices. DISCUSSION: PreventCD is expected to elucidate some of the genetic and immunological mechanisms involved in the process of immune intolerance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Coeliac disease is treated with a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). The aim of our study was to investigate whether the dietary (nondietary) compliance is associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of coeliac patients. METHODS: Patients from our hospital, known with coeliac disease for more than 10 years, were invited to participate in a study on possible gluten tolerance. HRQoL was assessed by the Short Form-36 health survey, symptoms by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and dietary compliance by a food frequency questionnaire. HRQoL of coeliac patients was compared with that of the general population. RESULTS: Fifty-three biopsy-confirmed coeliac patients were divided into three groups according to gluten consumption: GFD (n = 33), gluten transgression (<10 g gluten/day; n = 8) and normal gluten-containing diet (>10 g gluten/day; n = 12). Compared with the general population, coeliac patients scored significantly worse on general health perception but significantly better on bodily pain and limitations due to physical problems. The results of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and the Short Form-36 health survey were similar in all three dietary groups. CONCLUSION: Although adhering to the GFD is strictly important to prevent future complications, patients who stop following GFD do exist and patients with partial or nonadherence report similar HRQoL compared with patients with strict adherence in this group of adult coeliac patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Breath diagnostics, the measurement of volatile chemicals in human breath, is currently receiving attention as a technique for the detection of disease which, being non-invasive in nature, is particularly suited to screening for pre-symptomatic disease in healthy populations. A disorder in which more effective screening would be beneficial is celiac disease (CD), an under-diagnosed autoimmune disease of the small intestine characterized by nutritional malabsorption, which presents with diverse, and sometimes serious, symptoms. We aimed to determine whether breath analyses could be used to screen for the presence of CD. METHODS: Based on our hypotheses that malabsorption of dietary carbohydrates would lead to over production of alcohol fermentation products in the large intestine, we investigated levels of alcohols in the breath of 10 patients with CD compared to that in 10 healthy controls using selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS). RESULTS: No differences were found in the breath levels of methanol, propanol, butanol, heptanol or hexanol investigated using chemical ionization of breath air with H3O+ and/or NO+ precursor ions. In one patient, diagnosed within days of our study and not currently in receipt of any therapeutic intervention, a relatively high production of three product ions was detected compared to all other study patients. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that breath alcohol levels are unlikely to be of diagnostic use in CD, although further investigation of those recently diagnosed with the disorder may be warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac crisis is a life-threatening syndrome in which patients with celiac disease have profuse diarrhea and severe metabolic disturbances. Celiac crisis is rare among adults and not well documented. To improve awareness of this condition and to facilitate diagnosis, we reviewed cases of celiac crisis to identify presenting features, formulate diagnostic criteria, and develop treatment strategies. METHODS: Cases of biopsy-proven celiac disease were reviewed. Celiac crisis was defined as acute onset or rapid progression of gastrointestinal symptoms that could be attributed to celiac disease and required hospitalization and/or parenteral nutrition, along with signs or symptoms of dehydration or malnutrition. RESULTS: Twelve patients met preset criteria for celiac crisis; 11 developed celiac crisis before they were diagnosed with celiac disease. Eleven patients had increased titres of transglutaminase antibodies and 1 had immunoglobulin A deficiency. Results of biopsy analyses of duodenum samples from all patients were consistent with a Marsh 3 score (33% with total villous atrophy). Patients presented with severe dehydration, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte disturbances. All patients required hospitalization and intravenous fluids, 6 required corticosteroids, and 5 required parenteral nutrition. All patients eventually had a full response to a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac crisis has a high morbidity and, although rarely described, occurs in adults and often has a clear precipitating factor. Patients who present with severe unexplained diarrhea and malabsorption should be tested for celiac disease; treatment with systemic steroids or oral budesonide should be considered. Nutritional support often is required in the short term but most patients ultimately respond to gluten avoidance.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: : Several serologic assays are commercially available to aid in the diagnosis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE). Our objective in this study was to assess the performance of a novel combined antigen-screening assay for GSE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: : Deidentified sera from 111 pediatric patients suspected of having celiac disease (CD), 130 adults diagnosed with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and 77 pediatric and 49 adult normal controls were included in the study. Sera from 10 patients submitted to our laboratory for GSE testing with IgA deficiency and IgG antibodies against 1 or more of the traditional serologic markers associated with GSE were also included. All sera were screened for antibodies (IgA and IgG) against tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in a single test well. In addition, all sera were assessed for each individual marker and isotype using separate EIAs. RESULTS: : The IgA/IgG anti-tTG/DGP EIA screen was 92.6% sensitive and 94.3% specific in pediatric CD and detected 1 patient (Marsh 3c) who was IgA anti-tTG negative; this patient was not IgA deficient (<7.0 mg/dL). All 10 IgA-deficient sera gave positive results by the tTG/DGP EIA screen. Sensitivity and specificity of the tTG/DGP EIA screen in retrospective and prospective DH were 65% and 100% versus 62% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: : The new IgA/IgG anti-tTG/DGP EIA screen was slightly more sensitive than IgA anti-tTG alone in pediatric CD. This novel screening assay may allow the current recommendation of measuring total serum IgA in suspected GSE patients to be eliminated.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the correlation between level of tissue transglutaminase (TTG) and endomysial antibodies (EMAs) to different degrees of intestinal damage in celiac disease (CD) children with [presence of diabetes mellitus (DM)+] and without [absence of diabetes mellitus (DM-)] type I diabetes. We also assessed the correlation between albumin, hemoglobin (hgb), transaminases, symptom presence, age of cereal introduction, and body mass index (BMI) to different degrees of intestinal damage. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients seen at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January 2002 and June 2006 revealed 60 children (mean age 9.8 y) who had TTG, EMA, and other laboratory tests performed at time of histologic CD diagnosis from duodenal biopsies. Twenty-one of 60 children had DM. All children were stratified for histologic damage according to Marsh classification. RESULTS: Overall, Marsh (M) I lesions were seen in 2 (3.3%), MII in 2 (3.3%), IIIa in 14 (23.3%), IIIb in 15 (25%), and IIIc in 27 (45%); no differences in DM- versus DM+ groups. TTG was positive in all and EMA was positive in all but 1 child. Among DM- and DM+ children, median TTG and EMA values were higher with MIIIa-c, respectively. For DM-, BMI percentile, hgb, and mean corpuscular volume were lower with advancing histology. However, in DM+, no significant correlation of BMI percentile, hgb, or mean corpuscular volume with grade was observed. Cereal introduction age, hypoalbuminemia, and hepatitis did not differ between MIIIa-c in any group. CONCLUSIONS: TTG and EMA mean serum values are higher in CD children with severe enteropathy (MIIIc) than in those with mild enteropathy (MIIIa). CD in DM is accompanied by serologic and histologic findings identical to that of a non-DM CD population. As CD is identified through screening in DM, it is often silent and not associated with symptoms, growth abnormalities, or anemia. Clinical parameters (height, weight, hgb, symptoms) are not helpful in identifying silent CD in DM.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine whether children with celiac disease (CD) have deficits in spine (SP) and whole body (WB) bone mineral content (BMC) at time of diagnosis, and whether the deficits are related to altered growth and body composition. The secondary aim was to examine the effect of histological grade on BMC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of children who had undergone a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan at the time of diagnosis with CD between October 1, 2003, and June 15, 2006, were compared with a healthy reference sample of similar age and race from the same geographic region in the United States. SP and WB BMC were expressed as sex-specific z scores relative to age and relative to height to assess differences in the CD group versus controls. Pearson correlation, t tests, and analysis of variance were performed to determine predictors of BMC. RESULTS: Forty-four children (mean age 10.6 +/- 3.4 years; 77% female, 96% white) with CD were evaluated and compared with 338 healthy children. Children with CD were shorter than children of similar age and sex. SP and WB BMC for age z scores were significantly lower in the CD group compared with controls. When adjusted for height, significant deficits in WB BMC persisted in patients with CD. Low SP and WB BMC correlated with advanced histological grade in CD. Low body mass index correlated with low WB BMC in CD. CONCLUSIONS: Newly diagnosed children with CD may benefit from screening for low bone mineral content. Patients with low body mass index and those with advanced histological damage (Marsh grade IIIc) particularly may be at risk for osteopenia.},

   abstract = {Gastrointestinal disease is often overlooked or simply forgotten as a cause of osteoporosis. Yet, the consequences of osteoporotic fractures can be devastating. Although the bulk of the published experience regarding osteoporosis is derived from the postmenopausal population, this review will focus on gastrointestinal disorders implicated in osteoporosis, with an emphasis on inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. The unique aspects of gastrointestinal diseases associated with osteoporosis include early onset of disease (and, therefore, prolonged exposure to risk factors for developing osteoporosis, particularly with inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease), malabsorption, and maldigestion of nutrients necessary for bone health and maintenance (eg, calcium, vitamin D), as well as the impact of glucocorticoids. These factors, when added to smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, hypogonadism, and a family history of osteoporosis, accumulate into an imposing package of predictors for osteoporotic fracture. This paper will review the identification and treatment strategies for patients with gastrointestinal disorders and osteoporosis.},

The objective of this study was to clarify the effect of high amount of both kilned and unkilned oats on food and nutrient intakes in celiac patients in remission. Kilning as an industrial heating process is performed to preserve the main properties of oats and to lengthen its useableness. Kilning may, however, change the protein structure of oats and therefore influence on the intake of nutrients. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study group consisted of 13 men and 18 women with celiac disease in remission. The patients who were earlier using moderate amount of oats as part of their GFD were randomized to consume kilned or unkilned oats. After 6 months, the patients changed the treatment groups. The goal of daily intake of oats was 100 g. Food records and frequency questionnaire were used to follow nutrient intakes. RESULTS: Type of oats did not affect the amount of oats used. In the group using kilned oats, the intake of vitamin B1 and magnesium and in the group of unkilned oats that of magnesium and zinc increased significantly during the first 6 months (P<or=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: :Large amounts of oats, both kilned and unkilned in GFD, can increase intakes of nutrients in celiac patients in remission. Oats improve the nutritional value of GFD.},

To test the three selected taste groups, rats were infused with inosine monophosphate (IMP) and L: -glutamate (GLU) for umami, with glucose and sucrose for sweet, and with sodium chloride (NaCl) for salty. Infusions of IMP and GLU solutions significantly increased VGA activity and induced the autonomic reflex, which activated VCE and SAE; these reflexes were abolished after sectioning of the VGA. Infusions of glucose, sucrose and NaCl solutions, conversely, had no significant effects on VGA activity. These results suggest that umami substances in the stomach send information through the VGA to the brain and play a role in the reflex regulation of visceral functions.},

A 28-year-old woman presented with diarrhea, oral ulcers, and refractory uveitis of 2.5-years duration. She was treated with prednisone, mydriatic drops, and infliximab with no response. She was referred to our hospital at which point her previous diagnosis of uveitis was confirmed; she was also diagnosed with right-sided sacro-iliitis. The patient did not have arthritis or any skin conditions. Three tests for fecal parasites and a fecal leukocyte were negative. Endoscopy revealed atrophic appearance of the duodenal mucosa. Biopsy showed atrophy of the duodenal villi with intra-epithelial lymphocytes, hyperplasia of the crypts, and chronic inflammatory infiltrate. The search for antiendomysial antibody was >1/1,280. The patient was started on a gluten-free diet and after 3 months demonstrated significant improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and uveitis, as well as a reduction of antiendomysial antibodies (1/80). After 6 months, there was complete remission of gastrointestinal symptoms and total control of uveitis. The antiendomysial antibody was negative at that time. Clinical uveitis as a manifestation of celiac disease has been described in only two cases in the literature. This case study is the third to demonstrate that uveitis is a clinical symptom that can be addressed in patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and type of histological abnormalities in duodenal mucosa associated with Giardia lamblia in children who undergo esophago-gastroduodenoscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Duodenal biopsies containing G lamblia were retrieved from all paediatric patients who had undergone endoscopy in our centre in the last 20 years. These biopsies were scored for histological abnormalities by a single pathologist using a semiquantative scale and staged according to the Marsh criteria. In those with a Marsh stage above 0, the presence of coeliac disease was investigated. RESULTS: After excluding all patients with concomitant coeliac disease, 4 out of 32 (13%) patients had a biopsy showing crypt hyperplasia and 1 out of 32 (3%) had partial villous atrophy. No intraepithelial lymphocytosis was found. In our cohort, 2 patients with giardiasis and mild histological abnormalities were diagnosed with coeliac disease only after a repeated endoscopy and serology were performed; in 1 of them after a delay of 5 years. Other histological abnormalities frequently observed were increased eosinophilic infiltration of the lamina propria (35%) and lymph follicle formation (35%). Infiltration of neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes in the epithelial layer was observed less frequently (16% and 9%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Villous atrophy, intraepithelial lymphocytosis and/or crypt hyperplasia are rare in children with giardiasis who undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Therefore, other causes, particularly coeliac disease, should always be suspected. This study, however, suggests that giardiasis can cause chronic mucosal inflammation, often of an eosinophilic nature, in these children.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A gluten-free diet omitting wheat, rye, and barley is the only effective treatment for coeliac disease. The necessity of excluding oats from the diet has remained controversial. We studied the toxicity of oats in children with coeliac disease during a 2-year follow-up by investigating jejunal transglutaminase 2 (TG2)-targeted IgA-class autoantibody deposits, a potentially more sensitive disease marker than serum antibodies or conventional histology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three coeliac children in remission were randomized to undergo oat or gluten challenge with wheat, rye, barley, and oats. When jejunal histological relapse was evident after gluten challenge, patients excluded wheat, rye, and barley but continued with oats. Mucosal morphology and TG2-targeted autoantibody deposits were studied in jejunal biopsies taken at baseline and after 6 and 24 months. Furthermore, serum IgA-class TG2 antibodies were measured. RESULTS: At baseline, serum TG2 antibodies were negative in all 23 patients, but 7 of them had minor mucosal deposits. In the oats group, there was no significant change in the intensity of the deposits within 2 years. In contrast, during the gluten challenge, the intensity of the deposits clearly increased and decreased again when wheat, rye, and barley were excluded but consumption of oats was continued; this was in line with serum autoantibodies. The intensity of the mucosal deposits correlated well with both villous morphology and serum autoantibody levels. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of oats does not induce TG2 autoantibody production at mucosal level in children with coeliac disease. Measurement of small-intestinal mucosal autoantibody deposits is suitable for monitoring treatment in coeliac patients.},

   abstract = {Chronic pancreatitis (CP) can cause failure of both the exocrine and endocrine portions of the gland. Pain is the most recalcitrant clinical complaint in CP. Generally, conservative measures are first attempted to manage pain. These include cessation of alcohol use and smoking, enzyme replacement therapy, and finally, opioid analgesia. Endoscopy can be employed to treat the pain and complications due to CP. The results of the only two prospective randomized controlled trials suggest that surgery has a more durable effect than endoscopic therapy in controlling pain. Both trials suffer from severe limitations, however, and endoscopy remains the preferred approach for many patients because of its minimally invasive nature. Endoscopic ultrasound celiac plexus block has limited value in helping to control pain. More randomized trials are needed, along with further technologic innovation to improve the current treatment modalities. When considering interventional therapy for a patient with CP, a tailored and multidisciplinary therapeutic approach should be taken.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The clinical features of patients with celiac disease (CD) are variable. In the present study, clinical and laboratory features of 109 patients with CD were retrospectively evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all cases, diagnosis of CD was made by European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criteria and clinical and laboratory findings, including hematological and biochemical analyses, immunoglobulin levels, autoantibodies [antinucler antibody (ANA), antidouble stranded DNA (dsDNA), antimitochondrial antibody (AMA), anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), liver kidney antibody (LKM-1), anti thyroid peroxidase (TPO), anti thyroglobulin (Tg)], bone mineral density (BMD), and electroencephalogram were evaluated. The type of CD was recorded. RESULTS: Of 109 patients with CD, 66 (60.6%) were classical type, 41 (37.6%) were atypical type and 2 (1.8%) were silent type. The mean age was 8.81 +/- 4.63 years and the most common symptom was diarrhea (53.2%) followed by failure to thrive, short stature, and abdominal pain. Paleness (40.4%), underweight (34.8%), and short stature (31.2%) were the most common findings. Iron deficinecy anemia (81.6%), zinc deficiency (64.1%), prolonged prothrombin time (35.8%), and elevated transaminase levels (24.7%) were the most common laboratory findings. Eight percent of patients had at least 1 autoantibody, and 28 of 52 patients had low BMD. Four of 38 patients had abnormalty in electroencephalograms. The prevalance of selective immunoglobulin (Ig) A deficiency was 9.1%. Histocompatibility antigen HLA-DQ and/or DQ8 genotypes were found in 91% of patients. Abdominal distention, iron deficiency, prolonged prothrombine time, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated transaminase levels were more significantly frequent in the classical type than atypical type (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Although classical CD was seen in most patients in the present study, clinical variability of the condition should be kept in mind.},

The link between osteoclast, macrophage colony stimulating factor and pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 explain the association between inflammation and osteoporosis. These diseases are related to osteoporosis and high fracture risk independent of other risk factors common to inflammatory diseases such as reduced physical activity, poor nutritional status, hypovitaminosis D, decrease in calcium intake and glucocorticoid treatment. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein should always be performed, but the indication about when to perform the densitometry test should be analyzed for each disease. Bisphosphonates are nowadays the best choice of therapy but new medications such as denosumab, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and TNF-alpha antibody have risen as new potential treatments for osteoporosis secondary to inflammation.},

   abstract = {Various mechanisms detect the presence of dietary triacylglycerols (TAG) in the digestive tract and link TAG ingestion to the regulation of energy homeostasis. We here propose a novel sensing mechanism with the potential to encode dietary TAG-derived energy by translating enterocyte fatty acid oxidation (FAO) into vagal afferent signals controlling eating. Peripheral FAO has long been implicated in the control of eating (141). The prevailing view was that mercaptoacetate (MA) and other FAO inhibitors stimulate eating by modulating vagal afferent signaling from the liver. This concept has been challenged because hepatic parenchymal vagal afferent innervation is scarce and because experimentally induced changes in hepatic FAO often fail to affect eating. Nevertheless, intraperitoneally administered MA acts in the abdomen to stimulate eating because this effect was blocked by subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (21), a surgical technique that eliminates all vagal afferents from the upper gut. These and other data support a role of the small intestine rather than the liver as a FAO sensor that can influence eating. After intrajejunal infusions, MA also stimulated eating in rats through vagal afferent signaling, and after infusion into the superior mesenteric artery, MA increased the activity of celiac vagal afferent fibers originating in the proximal small intestine. Also, pharmacological interference with TAG synthesis targeting the small intestine induced a metabolic profile indicative of increased FAO and inhibited eating in rats on a high-fat diet but not on chow. Finally, cell culture studies indicate that enterocytes oxidize fatty acids, which can be modified pharmacologically. Thus enterocytes may sense dietary TAG-derived fatty acids via FAO and influence eating through changes in intestinal vagal afferent activity. Further studies are necessary to identify the link between enterocyte FAO and vagal afferents and to examine the specificity and potential physiological relevance of such a mechanism.},

In this study the effects of two gliadin-derived peptides (PA2, PQPQLPYPQPQLP and PA9, QLQPFPQPQLPY) on TNFalpha production by intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) and whether these effects were related to protein kinase A (PKA) and/or -C (PKC) activities have been evaluated. Caco-2 cell cultures were challenged with several sets of gliadin peptides solutions (0.25 mg/mL), with/without different activators of PKA or PKC, bradykinin (Brdkn) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). The gliadin-derived peptides assayed represent the two major immunodominant epitopes of the peptide 33-mer of alpha-gliadin (56-88) (LQLQPFPQPQLPYPQPQLPYPQPQLPYPQPQPF). Both peptides induced the TNFalpha production triggering the inflammatory cell responses, the PA2 being more effective. The addition of the peptides in the presence of dibutyril cyclic AMP (cAMP), Brdkn or PDTC, inhibited the TNFalpha production. The PKC-activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-diacetate additionally increased the PA2- and PA9-induced TNFalpha production. These results link the gliadin-derived peptides induced TNFalpha production through cAMP-dependent PKA activation, where ion channels controlling calcium influx into cells could play a protective role, and requires NF-kappaB activation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The only treatment for coeliac disease is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet. Several studies have reported nutritional deficiencies in individuals on a gluten-free diet. The present study aimed to determine whether the nutritional profile of gluten-free diet could be improved through the use of alternative grains. METHODS: A retrospective review of diet history records by a celiac specialist dietitian were used to establish a 'standard' gluten-free dietary pattern. An 'alternative' gluten-free dietary pattern was developed that substituted naturally gluten-free grains or gluten-free products made from 'alternative' flours (oats, high fibre gluten-free bread and quinoa) in the standard pattern. A paired t-test was performed to identify statistical significance between the 'alternative' and standard gluten-free dietary pattern. RESULTS: Analysis of standard pattern indicated that 38% of meals and snacks contained no grain or starch choice. Of those meals that contained a grain or starch component, rice was the grain chosen 44% of the time. The inclusion of alternative grains or grain products provided a higher nutrient profile compared to the standard gluten-free dietary pattern (P = 0.002). Several nutrients; protein (20.6 g versus 11 g), iron (18.4 mg versus 1.4 mg), calcium (182 mg versus 0 mg) and fibre (12.7 g versus 5 g) were significantly increased by changing the grain or starch component in the dietary pattern. The B vitamin content (riboflavin, niacin and folate) was improved, although this was not statistically significant (P = 0.125). DISCUSSION: The inclusion of alternative grain-based products increased the nutrient profile of the gluten-free dietary pattern significantly.},

The only life-long treatment is strict gluten-free diet which is difficult personally and socially, affects quality of life, not widely available, more expensive, with lower palatability, resulting in low compliance. No doubt, there is therefore an urgent need for alternative therapeutic modalities. Based on the increasing knowledge on the sequential pathophysiological events driving the intestinal inflammatory cascade, new attractive and potential therapies were starting to immerge: selecting, changing, degrading, manipulating or binding the dietary toxic environmental factors, decreasing intestinal permeability toward gluten or blocking the deamination of gluten by inhibiting tissue transglutaminase or the HLA-DQ presenting groove by carefully designed false peptide, shifting the typical Th1 to Th2 inflammatory reaction or antagonizing major proinflammatory cytokines, enhancing regulatory immune function or developing preventive vaccines, blocking adhesion molecule, inducing gluten oral or intranasal tolerance or applying epithelial repairing mitogens to oppose the mucosal destruction. Safety, effectiveness, cost and affordability are prime issues to consider. Some modalities have shown promising results in vitro. Future will show who will win the race.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Celiac disease (CD) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) are distinct disorders with specific clinico-pathological characteristics. Recent reports suggest an association between the 2. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of EE among children diagnosed with CD in our institution in the last 8 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Princess Margaret Hospital in Western Australia is the state's only pediatric referral center and the Department of Anatomic Pathology handles almost all of the pediatric gastrointestinal biopsy specimens. All of the children who had histological confirmation of CD between January 2000 and November 2007 were identified. Among this cohort, those who had concurrent esophageal biopsies performed were obtained and those with histology consistent with EE identified. The slides of all of these cases were reviewed. Case notes of children with CD and EE were reviewed for demographic details, symptoms, endoscopic findings, and follow-up data. RESULTS: Among the total of 250 children diagnosed with CD during the study period, 121 had concurrent esophageal biopsies. Ten children had histological findings consistent with EE, although only 7 had endoscopic findings suggestive of EE. Median eosinophil count in these esophageal biopsies was 52 per high power field (range 23-80). Four children had follow-up endoscopies and all 4 demonstrated recovery of duodenal mucosa but persistent esophageal eosinophilia on gluten-free diet. In 3 children resolution of EE occurred after specific treatment of EE. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of EE in this cohort of children with CD is at least 4%. This is likely to be an underestimation because only 121 of 250 children had concurrent esophageal biopsies. Coexistent EE should be kept in mind in children undergoing endoscopy for suspected CD, and esophageal biopsies should be obtained, irrespective of whether esophageal mucosa appears normal or abnormal at endoscopy.},

A search for predisposing factor is thus necessary. These factors may be anatomical (stenosis, blind loop), or functional (intestinal hypomotility, achlorydria).

We measured the cholesterol profile at diagnosis, and compared this with Health Survey for England figures, and again following 12 months treatment with a gluten-free diet in 100 consecutive adults with coeliac disease attending the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK. The mean total cholesterol was 4.84 (SD 1.2) mmol/l in adults (mean age 51 (SD 16) years) newly diagnosed with coeliac disease. At diagnosis of coeliac disease, men had 21% lower and women had 9% lower mean total cholesterol in comparison to the general population (difference in age-adjusted mean total cholesterol -1.09 mmol/l (95% CI -0.97, - 1.21); -0.46 mmol/l (95% CI -0.24, -0.68), respectively). There was no change in mean total cholesterol following treatment. However, there was a small but statistically significant increase of 0.12 mmol/l (95% CI 0.05, 0.18) in the mean HDL-cholesterol. Total cholesterol was lower at diagnosis in coeliac patients than in the general population and did not increase with 1 year of a gluten-free diet while HDL-cholesterol increased following treatment. Any increase in risk of IHD or stroke in people with coeliac disease is unlikely due to an adverse cholesterol profile either before diagnosis or after treatment with a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, atopic dermatitis, autoimmune thyroid diseases, and multiple sclerosis have a different seasonality of month of birth (MOB) from the general population. This study was undertaken to determine the seasonality of MOB in children with celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune-mediated enteropathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 431 children with CD (239 girls, 192 boys) were included in the study; 138 girls and 81 boys were under the age of 24 months. Data were analyzed by the cosinor method, which, in addition to statistical significance, provides parameters of rhythms. Statistical differences between groups were also analyzed by the chi test. RESULTS: Patients with CD showed different patterns from that in the general population, which peaks in September. Boys and girls with CD were found to have a different seasonality of MOB (P < 0.02). Girls whose CD was diagnosed before age 24 months (peak July-August) had a different seasonality of MOB from those whose CD was diagnosed after age 24 months (no rhythm; P < 0.005) and showed a different seasonality from boys whose CD was diagnosed above 24 months (peak July; P < 0.02). In addition, we found a different seasonality of MOB in children with a family history of CD compared with those with no family history (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Girls with the diagnosis of CD and patients of both sexes with a family history of CD have a different pattern of seasonality of birth from the general population. This is suggestive of a perinatal virus infection as a plausible candidate for the primary trigger.},

   abstract = {The wheat gluten protein alpha-gliadin, a well known trigger of celiac disease, can be complexed by random copolymers of hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and sodium 4-styrene sulfonate (SS). In this work, influence of alpha-gliadin and poly(HEMA-co-SS) concentrations on alpha-gliadin structure was studied using spectroscopic techniques and dynamic light scattering. In 70% ethanol or 0.06M HCl (pH 1.2), alpha-gliadin was found to self-associate upon increasing its concentrations and displayed decreased alpha-helical content and increased beta-turn and beta-sheet contents. At pH 1.2, alpha-gliadin interacted with poly(HEMA-co-SS) to form supra-molecular complex particles. Poly(HEMA-co-SS) induced alpha-gliadin structural changes that mimicked those obtained by varying the protein concentration in pure solution. At pH 6.8, alpha-gliadin was poorly soluble and formed large particles but alpha-helix is still main secondary structure. The influence of the polymer on protein structure was weaker at neutral than acidic pH. Interaction with poly(HEMA-co-SS) disrupted alpha-gliadin conformation and self-association to form new complex particles at neutral pH. This study provides insight into the mechanism of poly(HEMA-co-SS)/alpha-gliadin interaction and the polymer as alpha-gliadin sequestering agents in the supportive treatment of celiac disease.},

The interactions of alpha-gliadin with poly(SS) and poly(HEMA-co-SS) with 9 and 26 mol% SS content were studied at gastric (1.2) and intestinal (6.8) pH using circular dichroism and measurements of turbidity, dynamic light scattering and zeta potential. The interactions and their influence on alpha-gliadin secondary and aggregated structures depended mainly on the ratio of polymer negative and protein positive charges at pH 1.2, and on polymer SS content at polymer concentrations providing in excess of negative charges at either pH. Poly(SS) could not form complex particles with alpha-gliadin in a sufficient excess of negative charges. Copolymerization with HEMA enhanced the formation of complex particles. Poly(HEMA-co-SS) with intermediate SS content was found to be the most effective sequestrant for alpha-gliadin.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To establish the prevalence of headache in children with celiac disease (CD), the response to a gluten-free diet, and the prevalence of CD in children affected by headache. METHODS: This hospital-based study included 2 steps. In the retrospective part, 354 children with CD answered a questionnaire investigating the presence of headache before and after the gluten-free diet. The same questionnaire was administered to 200 healthy children matched for sex and age. In the prospective part, 79 children affected by headache were screened for CD by antitransglutaminase IgA. Diagnosis of CD was confirmed by duodenal biopsy; before starting a gluten-free diet patients underwent a brain positron emission tomography study. After 6 months of follow-up children were reevaluated for the presence of headache. RESULTS: Overall, 88 patients with CD complained of headaches before the diagnosis of CD as compared with 16 in the control group (24.8% vs 8%, P < 0.001). After the institution of a gluten-free diet, the headaches significantly improved in 68 children (77.3%), of whom 24 (27.3%) were headache-free during the study period. Four of 79 (5%) headache patients were found to have CD compared with 0.6% of the general population (P = 0.005). The brain positron emission tomography studies did not show any anomalies. During the follow-up, headaches improved in all 4 children with CD. CONCLUSIONS: We recorded -- in our geographical area -- a high frequency of headaches in patients with CD and vice versa with a beneficial effect of a gluten-free diet. Screening for CD could be advised in the diagnostic work-up of patients with headache.},

METHODS: A 48-year woman underwent gastric surgery for a gastric ulcer. She was referred to the nutrition unit for the study and treatment of a 3-year iron deficiency anemia refractory to oral iron supplementation. Blood tests, endoscopy and jejunal biopsy were made to study the case. RESULTS: Intestinal villi atrophy in the absence of celiac disease was the result. She was treated with intravenous iron, resolving the villous atrophy and thus oral iron supplementation could be effective. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates that iron deficiency may cause villous atrophy. In this setting, parenteral iron administration is necessary to correct the haematological and non-hematological alterations associated with this deficiency.},

Prospective clinical study included 42 children with celiac disease whose body weight was measured before introducing gluten-free diet, and after the period of six and 18 months of introducing gluten-free diet. The children were divided into three age groups. The first group consisted of 16 children, 8 females and 8 males in the age from 6 to 18 months, the second group consisted of 14 children, 8 females and 6 males ranging from the age of 20 to 111 months and the third group consisted of 12 children, 6 females and 6 males ranging from the age of 115 to 204 months. The measured body weight was compared with the centile tables of children of the same age. After introducing gluten-free diet the body weight was significantly higher at first, especially at the second control examination in comparison to the centile table of children of the same age and gender When comparing the results at the time of establishing the diagnosis and at the first and second control examination of the body weight of children the results showed no difference concerning gender and the age of children. In conclusion it can be said that is very important to diagnose celiac disease as soon as possible because the introduction of gluten-free diet prevents the pathological conditions mucosal lesion of small intestine and the physical retardation of children.},

In the gut, with exposure to myriad food and bacterial antigens, they probably control T cell unresponsiveness to food antigens and T cell hypersensitivity in disease situations. The need for the immune system to 'know' gut luminal antigens is demonstrated by the fact that dendritic cells send processes through the epithelium and directly sample antigens in the gut lumen. We present evidence that type I INF made by plasmacytoid dendritic cells may be important in coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In children younger than 2 years of age, a diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) is difficult to make because anti-endomysium (anti-EMA)/anti-tissue transglutaminase 2 (anti-TG2) antibodies are less sensitive than in older children. The aim of our study was to evaluate how many children younger than 2 years of age and diagnosed with CD, were negative for serum anti-TG2 antibodies and to test the hypothesis that in these patients, TG2-specific IgA deposits could instead be present at mucosal level. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 104 children younger than 2 years of age and 179 children older than 2 years, all of whom had been diagnosed with CD, were investigated for serum CD-associated antibodies (anti-gliadin [AGA] IgA and IgG, EMA-IgA, anti-TG2-IgA). The presence of intestinal anti-TG2 extracellular IgA deposits was searched by using double immunofluorescence in 56 of the patients younger than 2 years of age and in 40 of those who were older than 2 years. RESULTS: In children with CD who were younger than 2 years of age, high levels of AGA-IgA were found in 93/104 (89%) and 98/104 (94%) were found of have high levels of AGA-IgG. In children older than the age of 2 years with CD, 120/179 (67%) had high levels of AGA-IgA and 151/179 (84%) had high levels of AGA-IgG. Serum EMA were present in 92/104 (88%) in the younger group and in 176/179 (98%) of the older group. Ninety-one of 104 children (87%) younger and 172/179 (96%) older than 2 years showed high serum levels of anti-TG2. Finally, 41/56 (73%) children younger than 2 years and all of the 40 children (100%) older than 2 years of age showed mucosal anti-TG2-IgA deposits. CONCLUSIONS: EMA and anti-TG2-antibody measurements show higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of CD in children older than 2 years compared with younger children. The search for mucosal deposits of anti-TG2-IgA does not improve the diagnostic performance.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is an inflammatory disease of the upper small intestine and results from gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals, and is the only life-long nutrient-induced enteropathy. The only treatment is a strict gluten-free diet and the longer the individual fails to adhere to this diet, the greater the chance of developing malnutrition and other complications. The existence of reliable gluten free food is crucial to the well-being of the population. Here we report on a microfluorimeter device for the in situ detection of gliadin in foodstuffs, which could be used for a rapid control of raw materials in food processing, as well as for process control of gliadin contamination. The microfluorimeter is based on a reflector that is used inside a microfluidic chip, exploiting various strategically placed reflective or totally metallised mirrors for efficient collection of the fluorescent light emitted in a large solid angle. The chip is capable of executing five assays in parallel and has been demonstrated to possess detection sensitivity applicable to fluoroimmunoassays. Various immunoassay formats exploiting fluorescence detection, using enzyme/fluorophore labels were developed and compared in terms of sensitivity, ease of assay, assay time and compatibility with buffer used to extract gliadin from raw and cooked foodstuffs, with the best performance observed with an indirect competition assay using a fluorophore-labelled anti-mouse antibody. This assay was exploited within the microfluorimeter device, and a very low detection limit of 4.1 ng/mL was obtained. The system was observed to be highly reproducible, with an RSD of 5.9%, for a concentration of 50 ng/mL of gliadin applied to each of the five channels of the microfluorimeter. Biofunctionalised disposable strips incorporated into the microfluorimeter were subjected to accelerated Arrhenius thermal stability studies and it was demonstrated that strips pre-coated with gliadin could be stored for approximately 2 years at 4 degrees C, with no discernable loss in sensitivity or detectability of the assay. Finally, the microfluorimeter was applied to the analysis of commercial gluten-free food samples, and an excellent correlation with routine ELISA measurements was obtained. The developed microfluorimeter should find widespread application for on-site execution of fluoroimmunoassays.},

   abstract = {Mass spectrometry has arguably become the core technology for the characterization of food proteins and peptides. The application of mass spectrometry-based techniques for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the complex protein mixtures contained in most food preparations is playing a decisive role in the understanding of their nature, structure, functional properties and impact on human health. The application of mass spectrometry to protein analysis has been revolutionized in the recent years by the development of soft ionization techniques such as electrospray ionization and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization, and by the introduction of multi-stage and 'hybrid' analyzers able to generate de novo amino acid sequence information. The interfacing of mass spectrometry with protein databases has resulted in entirely new possibilities of protein characterization, including the high sensitivity mapping (femtomole to attomole levels) of post-translational and other chemical modifications, protein conformations and protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, and in general for proteomic studies, building up the core platform of modern proteomic science. MS-based strategies to food and nutrition proteomics are now capable to address a wide range of analytical questions which include issues related to food quality and safety, certification and traceability of (typical) products, and to the definition of the structure/function relationship of food proteins and peptides. These different aspects are necessarily interconnected and can be effectively understood and elucidated only by use of integrated, up-to-date analytical approaches. In this review, the main aspects of current and perspective applications of mass spectrometry and proteomic technologies to the structural characterization of food proteins are presented, with focus on issues related to their detection, identification, and quantification, relevant for their biochemical, technological and toxicological aspects.},

A possible origin of chromosomal alteration in autoimmune reaction could be mistakes in the rearrangement of V(D)J of the IgH gene. Our aim was to verify whether higher genomic instability was found in coeliac individuals and whether GFD reduced it. As marker of genomic instability we analysed the frequency of 2 translocations, t(14;18) and t(11;14), in peripheral blood by nested PCR, in 37 patients with CD at diagnosis, 27 patients with CD after 2 years on GFD, and 36 control individuals. No significant differences were found.},

   abstract = {Nutrition studies have provided unambiguous evidence that a number of human health maladies including chronic coronary artery, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer and age- and lifestyle-related diseases are associated with the diet. Several favorable and a few deleterious natural dietary ingredients have been identified that predispose human populations to various genetic and epigenetic based disorders. Media dissemination of this information has greatly raised public awareness of the beneficial effects due to increased consumption of fruit, vegetables and whole grain cereals-foods rich in phytonutrients, protein and fiber. However, the presence of intrinsically low levels of the beneficial phytonutrients in the available genotypes of crop plants is not always at par with the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for different phytonutrients (nutraceuticals). Molecular engineering of crop plants has offered a number of tools to markedly enhance intracellular concentrations of some of the beneficial nutrients, levels that, in some cases, are closer to the RDA threshold. This review brings together literature on various strategies utilized for bioengineering both major and minor crops to increase the levels of desirable phytonutrients while also decreasing the concentrations of deleterious metabolites. Some of these include increases in: protein level in potato; lysine in corn and rice; methionine in alfalfa; carotenoids (beta-carotene, phytoene, lycopene, zeaxanthin and lutein) in rice, potato, canola, tomato; choline in tomato; folates in rice, corn, tomato and lettuce; vitamin C in corn and lettuce; polyphenolics such as flavonol, isoflavone, resveratrol, chlorogenic acid and other flavonoids in tomato; anthocyanin levels in tomato and potato; alpha-tocopherol in soybean, oil seed, lettuce and potato; iron and zinc in transgenic rice. Also, molecular engineering has succeeded in considerably reducing the levels of the offending protein glutelin in rice, offering proof of concept and a new beginning for the development of super-low glutelin cereals for celiac disease patients.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is a genetically determined gluten-sensitive enteropathy resulting in nutrient malabsorption, with an increasing incidence world-wide. Clinical presentation in early childhood may include classic malabsorption symptoms, whereas older CD children often present extra-intestinal symptoms including short stature and pubertal delay. A gluten-free diet (GFD) generally leads to a rapid catch-up in growth and to normalization of the pituitary function. The pathogenesis of CD-associated short stature is still unclear. Besides the involvement of the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-I axis, a role for ghrelin was recently proposed. Furthermore, some CD patients do not show catch-up growth during GFD, despite reversion to seronegativity for CD markers including antiendomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. These subjects show GH deficiency and could potentially benefit from recombinant human GH therapy. This review deals with the management of short stature and the evaluation of growth axis function in CD children.},

The prevalence of lactose intolerance, fructose malabsorption and celiac sprue is quite high. If the symptoms are interpreted in the right way, the diagnosis and the treatment are easy. The ingestion of lactose or fructose containing food leads only to unpleasant symptoms, but in gluten sensitive patients an inflammation and destruction of the small intestinal mucosa develops. The consequences are an impaired absorption of macro- and micronutrients with their specific symptoms. The patients with lactose intolerance and fructose malabsorption can avoid the symptoms if they stick to a low lactose or fructose containing diet. On the other hand, patients with celiac sprue need a life-long gluten-free diet to heal the mucosa, to ameliorate the symptoms and to avoid relapses.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of celiac plexus block for the treatment of feeding intolerance in critically ill patients. METHODS: Nineteen mechanically ventilated medical patients intolerant of enteral nutrition and receiving metoclopramide underwent bilateral celiac plexus block. The anterior procedure was accomplished under sonographic guidance with the injection of either 25 mL bupivacaine 0.25% (celiac group, n = 10) or saline (control group, n = 9) bilaterally. Gastric emptying was assessed by the acetaminophen absorption method. After the block, nasogastric feeding was commenced, and nasogastric aspirates were collected once every 24 hours. Successful feeding was defined as 24-hourly gastric residual volume <250 mL with a feeding rate > or = 40 mL/h. RESULTS: Demographic data were similar for the 2 groups. The area under the plasma paracetamol absorption curve (383.8 +/- 248.1 mg . min . L(-1)) and the peak plasma paracetamol concentration (C(max); 3.28 +/- 2.15 mg/L) in the celiac group were significantly lower than the area under the curve value (1233.5 +/- 771.2) and C(max) value (10.14 +/- 6.04) in controls (P < 0.001 for all). After treatment, celiac plexus block reduced the mean gastric residual volume (celiac group: 430 +/- 32 mL to 205 +/- 30 mL, P < 0.001; control group: 450 +/- 33 mL to 461 +/- 19 mL, P > 0.05) and improved the proportion of patients with successful feeding (celiac block 80% vs controls 0%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In critical illness, celiac plexus block is effective for treating feeding intolerance when IV drug therapy has failed to improve gastrointestinal dysfunction.},

   abstract = {The increasing demand for high quality gluten-free (GF) bread, clean labels and natural products is raising the need for new approaches in GF bread-making. Sourdough is the foremost fermentation used for baking purposes and it has been proven to be ideal for improving the texture, palatability, aroma, shelf life and nutritional value of wheat and rye breads. These characteristic features derive from the complex metabolic activities of the sourdough-resident lactic acid bacteria and yeasts, e.g. acidification, production of exopolysaccharides, proteolytic- amylolytic- and phytase activity, and production of antimicrobial substances. These effects have been extensively studied and well described for traditional baking, whereas little is known about the role of sourdough in GF baking. Yet, the microbiological and qualitative characterisation of local GF fermented products indicate an overlap with the microbiota of wheat/rye fermentation and suggest that the positive metabolic activities of the sourdough microbiota are still retained during fermentation of GF crops. Thus, the use of sourdough in GF baking may be the new frontier for improving the quality, safety and acceptability of GF bread.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Verbal apraxia is a neurologically based motor planning speech disorder of unknown etiology common in autism spectrum disorders. Vitamin E deficiency causes symptoms that overlap those of verbal apraxia. Polyunsaturated fatty acids in the cell membrane are vulnerable to lipid peroxidation and early destruction if vitamin E is not readily available, potentially leading to neurological sequelae. Inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and malabsorption of nutrients such as vitamin E and carnitine may contribute to neurological abnormalities. The goal of this investigation was to characterize symptoms and metabolic anomalies of a subset of children with verbal apraxia who may respond to nutritional interventions. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A total of 187 children with verbal apraxia received vitamin E + polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation. A celiac panel, fat-soluble vitamin test, and carnitine level were obtained in patients having blood analyzed. RESULTS: A common clinical phenotype of male predominance, autism, sensory issues, low muscle tone, coordination difficulties, food allergy, and GI symptoms emerged. In all, 181 families (97%) reported dramatic improvements in a number of areas including speech, imitation, coordination, eye contact, behavior, sensory issues, and development of pain sensation. Plasma vitamin E levels varied in children tested; however, pretreatment levels did not reflect clinical response. Low carnitine (20/26), high antigliadin antibodies (15/21), gluten-sensitivity HLA alleles (10/10), and zinc (2/2) and vitamin D deficiencies (4/7) were common abnormalities. Fat malabsorption was identified in 8 of 11 boys screened. CONCLUSION: We characterize a novel apraxia phenotype that responds to polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E. The association of carnitine deficiency, gluten sensitivity/food allergy, and fat malabsorption with the apraxia phenotype suggests that a comprehensive metabolic workup is warranted. Appropriate screening may identify a subgroup of children with a previously unrecognized syndrome of allergy, apraxia, and malabsorption who are responsive to nutritional interventions in addition to traditional speech and occupational therapy. Controlled trials in apraxia and autism spectrum disorders are warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor weight gain and growth can be caused by many medical, nutritional, behavioral, and psychological factors. Crohn disease is one of the more common gastrointestinal etiologies associated with growth failure. The aim of this study is to determine the role of capsule endoscopy (CE) in the evaluation of older children and adolescents who were referred to a pediatric gastroenterology service for a chief complaint of unexplained growth failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of children with growth failure undergoing CE between August 2002 and November 2005. Height and weight (expressed as z scores) were recorded at least 6 months before study, at the time of the study, and at least 6 months post study. All of the patients had celiac disease and Crohn disease excluded using standard biochemical, radiologic, endoscopic, and histologic assessment. RESULTS: Seven children (4 males and 3 females) were included in the study-mean age 11.7+/-3.6 years. Indications for CE were growth failure associated with abdominal pain (3 patients), diarrhea and apthous ulcers (2 patients), delayed puberty (1 patient), or a family history of Crohn disease (1 patient). The mean z score for weight at the time of the study was 2.10+/-1.0 and for height was 1.50+/-0.7 All 7 children had normal small bowel series performed before the CE. All had both endoscopically and histologically normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. In 4 of 7 patients, multiple small bowel apthous ulcerations consistent with Crohn disease were identified by CE. All 4 patients who had abnormal CE were treated and started gaining weight. The mean z score for weight after 6 months of treatment was 1.35+/-1.2 and for height was 0.50+/-1.7. The mean z score for weight after treatment was significantly improved compared with the mean z score at diagnosis (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, 4 of the 7 older children and adolescents with unexplained growth failure and normal small bowel series were found to have Crohn disease involving the small intestine. In addition, we were able to show the improvement on the mean z score for weight after treatment of small bowel Crohn disease was instituted.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the small bowel that occurs in genetically predisposed people of all ages from middle infancy. Most common period of presentation is between six month and two years of age. Coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to gliadin, a gluten protein found in wheat. Upon exposure to gliadin, the enzyme tissue transglutaminase modifies the protein and the immune system cross reacts with the bowel tissue, causing an inflammatory reaction that leads to flattening of the lining of the small intestine, which interferes with the absorption of nutrient's. Here we describe the case of Ibrahim age 12 years was admitted in BSMMU on 9th February 2008. He had loose mucoid stool, abdominal distension, bloating and history of loss of weight for two years. He was malnourished moderately pale with clubbing. His weight and height was far below the standard for the age. Along with the routine examinations foecal fat estimation, MT, USG of whole abdomen, Barium follow through, endoscopic biopsy and tissue transglutaminage IgA autoantibody was done. Histopathological report was in favour of immunoproliferative small intestinal disease. Tissue transglutaminage IgA autoantibody was in higher level though done in a gluten free state. Wheat and food made by wheat was totally withdrawn then gradually the patient improved. Symptoms of diarrhoea, abdominal distention and bloatedness gradually decreased. For patients presenting with alteration of bowel habit, abdominal distension, bloating and history of weight loss for long time, the importance of considering coeliac diseases as a differential diagnosis cannot be overemphasized.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Sweden experienced a marked epidemic of celiac disease between 1984 and 1996 in children younger than 2 years of age, partly explained by changes in infant feeding. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of celiac disease in 12-year-olds born during the epidemic (1993), including both symptomatic and screening detected cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All sixth-grade children in participating schools were invited (n = 10,041). Symptomatic and, therefore, previously diagnosed celiac disease cases were ascertained through the National Swedish Childhood Celiac Disease Register and/or medical records. All serum samples were analyzed for antihuman tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-IgA (Celikey), and serum-IgA, and some for tTG-IgG and endomysial antibodies. A small intestinal biopsy was recommended for all children with suspected undiagnosed celiac disease. RESULTS: Participation was accepted by 7567 families (75%). Previously diagnosed celiac disease was found in 67 children; 8.9/1000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.7-11). In another 192 children, a small intestinal biopsy was recommended and was performed in 180. Celiac disease was verified in 145 children, 20/1000 (95% CI 17-23). The total prevalence was 29/1000 (95% CI 25-33). CONCLUSIONS: The celiac disease prevalence of 29/1000 (3%)-with two thirds of cases undiagnosed before screening-is 3-fold higher than the usually suggested prevalence of 1%. When these 12-year-olds were infants, the prevailing feeding practice was to introduce gluten abruptly, often without ongoing breast-feeding, which might have contributed to this unexpectedly high prevalence.},

A C/T(-13910) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), upstream of the lactase gene, is known to be associated with lactase non-persistence. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of lactase-persistent and non-persistent genotypes in the Hungarian population, the age at onset and the applicability of the lactose H2 breath test in comparison with genetic screening. The prevalence of the C/C(-13910) genotype among adults was 37%. Hypolactasia starts to appear at around 5 years of age. Over the age of 12 years, almost all of those with a C/C(-13910) genotype have lactase non-persistence. The C/C(-13910) genotype was closely associated with a positive lactose H2 breath test in symptomatic children, whereas the lactase-persistent genotypes correlated better with a negative H2 test in a control group. In conclusion, supplementary non-invasive breath and genotyping tests furnish a perfect clinical diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between celiac disease (CD) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) is recognized. Most cases of CD in patients with DM are reported to be asymptomatic. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to (1) compare and audit our practice with the published standards for screening for CD in children with DM, (2) characterize the children with DM and biopsy-confirmed CD, in terms of growth and gastrointestinal symptoms, and compare them with children with DM and negative celiac serology, and (3) document the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) after 1 year of gastrointestinal symptoms, growth, and insulin requirement. METHOD: We performed a retrospective case-note review of 22 children with DM, positive celiac serology +/- biopsy-confirmed CD, and 50 children with DM and negative celiac serology. RESULTS: Twenty-two children (3.9% of the total diabetic population) had positive celiac serology on screening, with 17 (3%) having biopsy-confirmed CD. Ninety-four percent of the children had standardized celiac serology testing. At diagnosis of CD, 13 of the 17 biopsy-positive children (76.4%) had > or =1 gastrointestinal symptom. The frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms in negative celiac serology diabetic children was 6% (3 of 50) (P < .0005). Symptoms resolved in all children after introduction of a GFD. A significant improvement in weight SD score (P = .008) and BMI SD score (P = .02) was noted in those compliant with a GFD after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Children with DM and CD have a higher frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms than their diabetic peers with negative celiac serology and are not truly asymptomatic. Institution of a GFD has a positive effect on nutritional status and symptom resolution in the short-term.},

   abstract = {Breast milk is the initial natural food for infants, but already during the second half year complementary feeding is essential. Epidemiological research, first on celiac disease and later on atopic diseases, has driven a paradigm shift with respect to most favorable age to introduce complementary feeding. Simplified, this implies a shift from later to earlier introduction, which is now taken into account in recommendations on infant feeding. Complementary feeding, including all foods, should not be initiated for any infant before 4 months of age, and not later than around 6 months, including infants with elevated disease risk (e.g. for celiac disease or atopic diseases). Motivating reasons could be that ongoing breastfeeding provides an 'immunological umbrella' and/ or a different age interval gives a 'window of opportunity' for developing oral tolerance towards gluten and other food antigens. This will for some infants be in conflict with recent WHO recommendations on exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months. Epidemiology has evolved over time and could, if increasingly used, contribute even more to innovations in pediatric nutrition and other phenomena related to population health.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an inflammatory disorder of the small intestine, triggered by the ingestion of gluten proteins contained in wheat, barley or rye, in genetically susceptible individuals. This disorder is considered to be mainly mediated by cellular immunity and restricted to the human leucocyte antigen-DQ presentation of gluten-derived toxic peptides to T-cells. Moreover, the involvement of innate immunity has been recently demonstrated to be necessary also for the development of intestinal tissue damage. Genetic susceptibility accounts for an uncertain proportion of the disease risk and gluten introduction works as the precipitating factor. However, currently, the research interest is also focused on environmental factors and gene-environment interactions, especially during the first months of life, which might help explain the onset of the disease. Infectious and dietary factors that could modulate the immune response orientating it either towards tolerance or intolerance/autoimmunity are the focus of primary attention. A significant number of studies have looked into the protective effect of breast-feeding against the disease. It is generally accepted that breast-feeding during the introduction of dietary gluten and increasing the duration of breast-feeding are associated with reduced risk of developing celiac disease. However, it is still not fully established whether breast-feeding truly protects with permanent tolerance acquisition or only reduces the symptoms and delays the diagnosis. Moreover, the timing and dose of gluten introduction also seem to be relevant and long-term prospective cohort studies are being carried out in order to elucidate its role in celiac disease development.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD), or permanent gluten intolerance, is one of the most common chronic food-related diseases among children in Europe and the USA. The treatment is lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) (i.e. the exclusion of wheat, rye and barley from the diet, which are important sources particularly of iron, dietary fibre and vitamin B). The present study aimed to evaluate dietary intakes of energy and nutrients in children and adolescents on GFD and compare these with intake of comparable age groups on a normal diet as well as current recommendations. METHODS: Thirty children, 4-17 years of age with confirmed CD and on GFD were agreed to participate in this study at the Department of Pediatrics, Umea University Hospital. Weight and height were used to calculate individual energy requirement according to Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 2004 (NNR-04). Dietary intake was assessed using 5-day food records and household measures were used for quantities. Twenty-five children completed their dietary record. RESULTS: Thirteen of the 25 children did not meet the recommended energy intake and the dietary intakes were inadequate regarding quality of macronutrients and quantity of minerals and vitamins. The mean intakes of sucrose and saturated fatty acids were above and the intakes of dietary fibre, vitamin D, magnesium and selenium below the NNR-04. High intakes of sucrose and saturated fat and a low intake of dietary fibre were also noted in a previous national survey on healthy children on a normal diet. The nutrient density of vitamin D, riboflavin, niacin, thiamine, magnesium and selenium were lower among CD children than healthy children but, for iron and calcium, it was higher in CD children. CONCLUSIONS: Children on GFD appear to follow the same trends as healthy children on a normal diet, with high intakes of saturated fat and sucrose and low intakes of dietary fibre, vitamin D and magnesium compared to recommendations.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an auto-immune enteropathy, triggered in genetically predisposed individuals by the ingestion of dietary gluten. Gluten is the alcohol-soluble protein component of the cereals wheat, rye and barley. CD is a multifactorial condition, originating from the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. The necessary environmental trigger is gluten, while the genetic predisposition has been identified in the major histocompatibility complex region on chromosome 6, with over 90% of CD patients expressing HLA DQ2 and the remaining celiac patients express DQ8. The fact that only about 4 % of DQ2/8-positive individuals exposed to gluten develop CD, has led to the recognition that other genetic and environmental factors are also necessary. In the last few years, several epidemiological studies have suggested that the timing of the introduction of gluten, as well as the pattern of breastfeeding, may play an important role in the subsequent development of CD. Here, we present and review the most recent evidences regarding the effect of timing of gluten introduction during weaning, the amount of gluten introduced and simultaneous breastfeeding, on the development of CD.},

   abstract = {For adolescents with celiac disease (CD), a gluten-free diet (GFD) is crucial for health, but compliance is problematic and noncompliance is common even among those aware of the risks. To better understand their lives with the disease, Swedish CD adolescents were invited to take part in focus group discussions. Data were analyzed for recurrent stigma-related themes across the groups. Adolescents described an awareness of being different from others that was produced by meal appearance and the poor availability of gluten-free food. The GFD often required discussions and special requests, so eating in public had the effect of making an invisible condition visible, and thereby creating a context for felt or enacted stigma. Maintaining invisibility avoided negative consequences of stigma, and other strategies were used to reduce the costs of visibility. The results of the study show that the GFD can produce stigma experiences in adolescence, and that dietary compliance (or lack thereof) can be understood in terms of dealing with GFD concealment and disclosure.},

METHODS: Prospective nationwide Swedish incidence register of CD in children 0-15 years of age, with the present analysis covering the period from 1998 to 2003. ESPGHAN diagnostic criteria for CD were used. Regions were classified according to the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics. The incidence rate for each region, gender, age group and year of diagnosis was calculated. RESULTS: A regional variation in CD risk was demonstrated. The childhood populations in 'West Sweden' and 'Smaland and the islands', situated in the southern part of the country, had a significantly higher incidence rate compared to in 'North Middle Sweden' and 'Stockholm', situated in the central part. This regional variation was not explained by variations in risk by gender, age at diagnosis or year of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The Swedish regional variation in CD risk supports multifactorial disease aetiology. Continued efforts are warranted to define factors, besides gluten exposure, that modulate CD risk.},

Recent investigations which have focused on tissue transglutaminase are promising with respect to the clarification of the mechanism of infertility and poor pregnancy outcomes in CD. In this review, the effects of CD on male and female reproductive disorders and pregnancy outcomes are discussed and the need for CD screening in the case of reproductive problems is emphasized.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Studies have shown that the circulating citrulline concentration is decreased in patients with proximal small bowel villous atrophy from coeliac disease and more so in patients with extensive damage to the intestinal mucosa, but there have been few data on HIV enteritis and tropical enteropathy (TE). Our primary aim was to correlate serum citrulline with the degree of reduction of the enterocyte mass in HIV-infected patients with TE. METHODS: Postabsorptive fasting serum citrulline was measured in 150 TE pts, 44 of whom had HIV infection, using reverse phase, high performance liquid chromatography. Absorptive capacity and permeability were measured after intrajejunal instillation of 4 sugars (5 g lactulose, 1 g L-rhamnose, 0.5 g D-xylose, 0.2 g 3-O methyl D glucose) with assay by thin-layer chromatography. Morphometric analysis was carried out on jejunal biopsies. RESULTS: In HIV positive patients, the median serum citrulline was significantly lower (median 19, interquartile range (IQR) 17-24 mumol/L) than in HIV negative patients (median 27, IQR 23-33 mumol/L; p < 0.001). There were statistically significant correlations (p < 0.005) between citrulline and: crypt depth; villous height/crypt depth ratio; Shenk-Klipstein score; and xylose absoption, only in the HIV positive. CONCLUSIONS: Serum citrulline concentration appears to be a quantitative biomarker of small bowel mass integrity in HIV positive enteropathy and deserves assessment as a surrogate for monitoring anti-retroviral therapy.},

   abstract = {The global prevalence of celiac disease is of one person per 250 inhabitants. The disease is induced by gluten, a peptide contained in wheat, rye and barley that during small intestinal digestion generates smaller peptides. Some of these are resistant to hydrolysis and cross through the epithelium into the mucosa, inducing a cascade of immune reactions leading to the appearance of the disease in susceptible individuals. Gluten appeared as a consequence of agricultural practices initiated 10000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent of southwest Asia. Celiac disease epidemiology is complicated since consumption of gluten differs depending on the origin of populations. Treatment of celiac disease consists of withdrawing gluten from the diet, a task that becomes difficult in the long term. The concept of gluten-free food has changed along time. This article updates the concept of celiac disease, the history of gluten consumption in the world, the characteristics of a gluten free diet and the difficulties to adhere to it.},

   abstract = {In 1958, A. M. Ugolev (1926-1991) discovered parietal (membrane) digestion (MD) that differs fundamentally from cavity and intracellular digestion in the strictly directed arrangement of active centers of enzymes and in coupling to the membrane transport systems. The three-stage sequential triad: cavity digestion--MD--absorption has given an insight into the mechanism responsible for an extremely high food assimilation rate in the gastrointestinal tract and become as the basis of the current digestion theory stated by Academician A. M. Ugolev. Membrane maldigestion results from atrophic changes in the small bowel mucosa in gluten-sensitivity celiac disease, enteric infections, excessive small intestinal microflora growth, and intestinal damages induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, some antibiotics, and antimetabolites. Clinically, it presents with poor tolerability of nutrients containing oligomers, whose digestion is impaired, and with malabsorption symptoms. Indirect (load) and direct (perfusion) tests, as well as biochemical and histological studies of the activity of membrane enzymes are proposed for the diagnosis of membrane maldigestion. The detection and elimination of agents that damage the intestinal mucosa (gluten, lactose, pathogenic microflora, and pharmacologicals) form the basis for the etiotropic treatment of patients with impaired MD. A. M. Ugolev's discovery has led not only to the major general biological generalization--the current theory of digestion, but also to the revision of the pathogenesis, clinical signs, and treatment of diseases accompanied by enteric food malassimilation.},

Although historically it was thought that it was an infrequent pediatric disease, now it is know that its prevalence is close to 1% in the general population. It is even higher between patients with some endocrine disorders and nutritional deficits. The use of antitransglutaminase and antiendomisium antibodies and the endoscopical duodenal biopsy are the cornerstones for its diagnosis. The introduction of a gluten-free diet will achieve the normalization of the intestinal mucosa. It will avoid the risk of long term complications and an it will achieve an improvement in quality of life.

   abstract = {Use of sourdough is of expanding interest for improvement of flavour, structure and stability of baked goods. Cereal fermentations also show significant potential in improvement and design of the nutritional quality and health effects of foods and ingredients. In addition to improving the sensory quality of whole grain, fibre-rich or gluten-free products, sourdough can also actively retard starch digestibility leading to low glycemic responses, modulate levels and bioaccessibility of bioactive compounds, and improve mineral bioavailability. Cereal fermentation may produce non-digestible polysaccharides, or modify accessibility of the grain fibre complex to gut microbiota. It has also been suggested that degradation of gluten may render bread better suitable for celiac persons. The changes in cereal matrix potentially leading to improved nutritional quality are numerous. They include acid production, suggested to retard starch digestibility, and to adjust pH to a range which favours the action of certain endogenous enzymes, thus changing the bioavailability pattern of minerals and phytochemicals. This is especially beneficial in products rich in bran to deliver minerals and potentially protective compounds in the blood circulation. The action of enzymes during fermentation also causes hydrolysis and solubilisation of grain macromolecules, such as proteins and cell wall polysaccharides. This changes product texture, which may affect nutrient and non-nutrient absorption. New bioactive compounds, such as prebiotic oligosaccharides or other metabolites, may also be formed in cereal fermentations.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Assays of tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) represent the cornerstone of serological coeliac disease (CD) diagnostics. Assays of antibodies against native gliadin (anti-nGli) lost importance due to low validity. We investigated the performance of new assays for antibodies against deamidated gliadin (anti-dGli) in childhood CD. METHODS: We retrospectively compared children (142 with active CD and 160 without CD, diagnosis confirmed or excluded by intestinal biopsy) concerning (immunoglobulin [Ig] G and IgA) anti-nGli, anti-tTG, and 2 different anti-dGli assays. RESULTS: IgG-anti-dGli1, IgG-anti-dGli2, and IgA-anti-tTG performed similarly. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 98.6%, 98.9%, and 97.9%; accuracy was 94.7%, 95.7%, and 96.7%. Anti-dGli1 and anti-dGli2 (IgG and IgA) and IgA-anti-tTG performed significantly better than IgA-anti-nGli and IgG-anti-nGli. Both IgG-anti-dGli showed higher AUC and accuracy than IgA-anti-dGli and IgG-anti-tTG. Combined evaluation of IgA-anti-tTG with one of the IgG-anti-dGli tests reduced the rate of falsely classified patients. At enhanced cutoff (specificity >99%), sensitivity was above 67% for both IgG-anti-dGli and IgA-anti-tTG. If IgA-anti-tTG assay was combined with one of the IgG-anti-dGli tests, then the fraction of patients identified with more than 99% specificity as coeliacs increased significantly above 84.5%. Combined evaluation of the 2 IgG-anti-dGli tests did not improve the performance. CONCLUSIONS: The new IgA and IgG-anti-dGli tests outperform conventional anti-nGli assays. The validity of IgG-anti-dGli cannot be distinguished from IgA-anti-tTG. It should be studied prospectively whether antibody assays could replace biopsy in diagnosis of CD in a substantial segment of children.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disease, triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by ingested gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and other closely related cereal grains. The only treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet for life. This paper presents a systematic review of the scientific literature on the safety of pure oats for individuals with celiac disease, which historically has been subject to debate. Limitations identified within the scientific database include: limited data on long-term consumption, limited numbers of participants in challenge studies, and limited reporting about the reasons for withdrawals from study protocols. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that a small number of individuals with celiac disease may be intolerant to pure oats and some evidence from in vitro studies suggests that an immunological response to oat avenins can occur in the absence of clinical manifestations of celiac disease as well as suggesting that oat cultivars vary in toxicity. Based on the majority of the evidence provided in the scientific database, and despite the limitations, Health Canada and the Canadian Celiac Association (CCA) concluded that the majority of people with celiac disease can tolerate moderate amounts of pure oats. The incorporation of oats into a gluten-free diet provides high fiber and vitamin B content, increased palatability, and beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. However, it is recommended that individuals with celiac disease should have both initial and long-term assessments by a health professional when introducing pure oats into a gluten-free diet.},

METHODS: The study was conducted during April-June 2006 sending a questionnaire to 24 School Directions of nursery and primary schools in a Northern Italian region (Friuli Venezia Giulia). RESULTS: Considering all the schools we obtained a global response rate of 82.3% (115/142): 73.7% (42/57) of nursery schools and 85.9% (73/85) of primary school. 86.1% (99/115) of teachers thought that doing programmes aimed to improve nutrition behaviours is effective. 98.3% (113/115) of teachers answered that favourite fats in the diet are vegetables, 23.5% (27/115) that 55%-60% of the total caloric intake in children diet should consist in carbohydrates, 37.4% (43/115) ticked correct definition of diabetes. 75.7% (87/115) of interviewed teachers explain the term Body Mass Index correctly and 42.6% (49/115) know the cut-off between normal weight and overweight. CONCLUSION: analysing the levels of importance attributed by teachers to nutrition issues, it emerges a noteworthy interest on this topic. This should be a stimulus to promote projects and training courses on this topic.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gluten-free diet (GFD) presents the basis of coeliac disease (CD) treatment. If strictly applied, the disorders of the small bowel mucosa and other disease signs rapidly resolve. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to evaluate the effect of GFD on the growth and nutritional status of children with the classical form of CD. In addition, we analyzed the differences between these parameters with the duration and the patients' compliance with GFD. METHODS: The study goals were achieved on a sample of 90 children, 56 female and 34 male, aged 0.5-7.5 (1.53 +/- 1.05) years, with the classic CD diagnosed on the basis of typical pathohistological findings of the small bowel mucosa and clinical recovery of patients on GFD. The duration of the patients' follow-up was 1.08-8.75 (3.03 +/- 1.14) years, i.e. until the age of 2.5-15 (4.59 +/- 1.78) years. The initial and control values of body height (BH) in relation to matched values for age and gender were expressed in percentiles, while the deviation in body weight (BW) for the matched values of height and gender was expressed in percentages. The referent haemoglobin (Hb) rate in blood, as a laboratory indicator of nutritional status in children aged up to 5 years was > or = 110 g/L, and for those aged above 5 years it was > or = 115 g/L Compliance with GFD was based on the pathohistological findings of the small bowel mucosa or determination of tissue transglutaminase. RESULTS: Over the studied period, the effect of GFD was highly significant, both on the increase of BH percentiles (37.62 +/- 26.26 vs. 57.22 +/- 25.29; p < 0.001), and on the decrease of BW deficit 11.58 +/- 10.80 vs. 0.89 +/- 8.194; p < 0.001). After the treatment period, none of the children showed slowed growth rate or BW deficit above 20%, while BW deviation ranging between 10-20% in relation to the referent values was registered in 17 (18.19%) and the excess of over 20% in 2 patients. In 86 (95.56%) patients, control Hb values in blood were normal, while mild anaemia was registered in 4 patients, all compliant with GFD. The difference between the compliant and non-compliant patients with GFD was not detected either in BH percentiles (p = 0.586) or in BW percentage deviation as compared to standard values (p = 0.516) or in blood Hb values (p = 0.445). In addition, differences between the children on GFD lasting over and below 3 years were not detected either in BH percentiles (p = 0.915) or in BW deviation percentages in relation to the ideal rate (p = 0.476). CONCLUSION: GFD applied for 1-3 years has a highly significant effect on the growth rate and nutritional status of children with the classical form of CD. Significant differences in these parameters of the disease were not detected between strictly compliant and non-compliant patients on GFD.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate whether duration of breastfeeding and timing of gluten introduction influence the age at diagnosis and severity of celiac disease. METHODS: Medical records of 89 infants (59 girls and 30 boys; mean age of 14.2 months, standard deviation 4.80) diagnosed with classic celiac disease at the University Children's Hospital in Belgrade from 2000 to 2008 were retrospectively analyzed to determine the duration of breastfeeding and timing of gluten introduction. The severity of celiac disease was assessed based on weight loss, longitudinal growth retardation, anemia, and secondary lactose intolerance. RESULTS: Longer breastfeeding significantly reduced the risk that celiac disease would manifest in the first year of life (odds ratio, 0.655; 95% confidence interval, 0.481-0.891; P=0.007), and duration of breastfeeding was the most significant predictor of developing celiac disease (B=0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.131-0.768; P=0.007). There were no significant differences in age at diagnosis between infants who had started consuming gluten before the fourth month and those who had started between the fourth and sixth month. Neither breastfeeding nor timing of gluten introduction affected the severity of the disease. CONCLUSION: Longer breastfeeding and continuation of breastfeeding after gluten introduction delay the onset of classic celiac disease. On the other hand, neither breastfeeding nor the timing of gluten introduction affects the severity of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is recognized as one of the most common and important autoimmune gastrointestinal disorders affecting children. There is evidence that a diagnosis of CD during childhood improves health outcomes. The increasing prevalence of CD is due to increased awareness of the wide range of extraintestinal symptoms associated with CD. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there has been a temporal increase in the diagnosis of CD associated with an increased diagnosis of children without typical gastrointestinal symptoms at the Stollery Children's Hospital (Edmonton, Alberta). METHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven CD diagnosed at the Stollery Children's Hospital from 1998 to 2007, were identified by retrospective chart review. Baseline and follow-up data, including demographics, symptoms, risk factors, anthropometrics and laboratory investigations, were collected. RESULTS: An increase in the frequency of diagnosis of CD was noted during the study period, particularly from January 2003 onward. Before January 2003, nine children were diagnosed with CD - all with typical symptoms. Between January 2003 and January 2007, inclusive, 149 children were diagnosed with CD, of whom 46% had absent or atypical symptoms. At follow-up, 96% of patients reported improved symptoms, including 53% of individuals who reported being asymptomatic before diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: In the last four years of the period studied, the number of children diagnosed with CD at Stollery Children's Hospital increased 11-fold. Screening children at risk for CD, and those with atypical presentations, contributed to the increased number of diagnoses. Identification of CD and establishment of lifelong, dietary gluten avoidance during childhood has important health benefits and should be encouraged.},

Guidelines for serologic testing and confirmation of diagnosis of celiac disease by the American Gastroenterological Association and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition are used in this review. Level 1 evidence was used. MAIN MESSAGE: Although blood tests are helpful for screening purposes, the confirmatory test for celiac disease is a small intestinal biopsy. CONCLUSION: Patients whose blood tests for celiac disease provide positive results should have endoscopic small intestinal biopsies to confirm the diagnosis before starting a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The patchy nature of villous lesion in celiac disease is increasingly being recognized. Current guidelines recommend four endoscopic duodenal mucosal biopsies from the second or more distal part of the duodenum to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease. The purpose of the study was to investigate the usefulness of duodenal bulb mucosal biopsies in confirming the diagnosis of celiac disease in everyday clinical practice. METHODS: All patients with a positive tissue-transglutaminase antibody requiring biopsy-confirmation of celiac disease over a two-year period were studied. Two endoscopic biopsies were taken from the duodenal bulb and four biopsies from the second (or distal) part of the duodenum. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were included, mean age 8.1 (+/- 4.7) years. Thirty-one (88.6%) patients had abnormal distal duodenal biopsies, one had Marsh type 1, one had Marsh type 2 and twenty-nine had Marsh type 3 lesion. All but two patients with abnormal distal duodenal biopsies also had abnormal bulb biopsies. Four (11.4%) patients had normal distal duodenal biopsies but abnormal bulb biopsies. Of these, one patient had Marsh type 2 and three had Marsh type 3 lesion. The distal duodenum was also grossly normal in these four patients. The histological diagnosis of celiac disease would not have been possible in these four cases with distal duodenal biopsies only. CONCLUSION: The lesion in celiac disease in children can be patchy with duodenal bulb mucosa being the only area showing histological changes. The recommendations regarding the site of biopsies should be revised to include biopsies not only from distal duodenum but also from bulb to improve the diagnostic yield.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In celiac disease (CD) the degree of histological damage in the duodenum may vary, but there is some controversy about the coexistence of villous atrophy and normal mucosa in different biopsy sites, i.e., patchy villous atrophy. We prospectively evaluated the degree, frequency, and distribution of histological lesions among different duodenal sites as well as within each duodenal biopsy. METHODS: Over the last 4 years, in each patient with suspected CD (positive anti-transglutaminase antibodies), four to five endoscopic biopsies were taken from the duodeno-jejunal flexure/distal duodenum (D3), intermediate duodenum (D2), proximal duodenum (D1), and duodenal bulb (B). Biopsies were subjected to hematoxylin/eosin staining and immunostaining with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies for intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) count. Duodenal lesions were classified according to Marsh-Oberhuber, and CD was diagnosed according to the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition criteria. RESULTS: Six hundred and eighty-six children did have CD. A degree of villous atrophy was found in 660/686 patients (96.2%), total villous atrophy was present in 550/686 (80.1%), and 320/686 (46.6%) had different lesions at different sites, but none of these patients had entirely normal biopsies. In all, 116 of 686 (16.9%) had variable lesions within the same biopsy, with grade 2+3A being the most frequent association (43%), followed by 2+3A+3B (27%) and 2+3A+3B+3C (22%). All these 116 patients also had histologically normal areas within the same biopsy, but anti-CD3 immunostaining showed that IELs were always increased in such areas. In all the cases, the severity of duodenal lesions significantly increased in an aborad manner (chi(2)=52.38 with alpha=0.01 and d.f.=12; P<0.0001). No correlation was found between type and distribution of histologic lesions and clinical presentation of CD. CONCLUSIONS: In newly diagnosed CD, some variability of histological lesions can be found, even within the same duodenal biopsy, in which areas of apparently normal mucosa with increased IEL number often exist. We also confirm our previous findings that duodenal lesions may vary among different biopsies; lesion severity has a proximal-to-distal gradient, but no patient has entirely normal duodenal biopsies. The awareness of such histological variability may help establish a correct diagnosis of CD.},

METHODS: A total of 134 patients underwent plasma zinc estimation at baseline and after a four week period. Zinc-deficient patients were randomly assigned to two groups. Group G (n = 48) received GFD without zinc supplementation, Group G + Z (n = 48) received GFD with zinc supplementation for 4 weeks. RESULTS: The rise in plasma Zinc levels was significant in each group regardless of zinc supplementation but similar when compared in the two groups after 4 weeks. Mean zinc levels at baseline and increase in zinc levels were statistically similar at 4 weeks in patients with diarrhea and short stature. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc levels rise with GFD irrespective of zinc supplementation.},

For this reason, the main goal of this study is to develop chocolate cookies with sorghum flour (Sorghum vulgare). The experimental design used was the simplex-lattice factor to compare the following variables: sorghum flour (50-100%), rice flour (0-50%) and corn starch (0-50%), totaling up to ten experiments. The formulations IX and X were selected as the ones with the highest sensorial scores The sorghum flour, regular chocolate cookies and gluten free cookies were submitted to physicochemical analysis. Physical and sensorial analysis using Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA) and hedonic analysis were performed for the two cookies preparation. Sorghum flour presented characteristics compared with the described by the food regulation laws. The preparations that presented satisfactory sensorial characteristics were the ones that had 58 and 67% of sorghum flour, 8 and 17% of rice flour, 33 and 17% of corn starch, respectively. The performance for both IX and X formulations was 0,92 and the specific volume was 1,54 and 1.46 cm3/g, respectively. When compared with regular cookies, the differences on most of the sensorial attributes evaluated on sorghum cookies were not statistically significant (P < 0.05), except for the color and the odour. All the sensorial scores reached values equal or higher than 7 for both samples and most of them scored 8. The results showed the feasibility of including sorghum flour on the manufacture of gluten free cookies.},

The present study aimed to investigate the compliance with a GFD and the impact of CD and GFD on the lifestyle of patients and their families, together with proposed recommendations for improvement of quality of life. METHODS: Children with biopsy confirmed CD were recruited consecutively from the outpatient gastroenterology clinic. Participants were evaluated by a special questionnaire for compliance with the GFD, patients' knowledge about CD, and the well-being and lifestyle of children and their families. Comparisons between discrete variables were performed by a chi-square test. RESULTS: Seventy-three children of median age 9.4 (interquartile range = 5-14.5) years were evaluated. Compliance to diet was reported by 58%. Reasons for noncompliance were: poor palatability (32%), dining outside home (17%), poor availability of products (11%), and asymptomatic disease diagnosed by screening (11%). The acceptance of the GFD was reported as good in 65%, whereas avoidance of travelling and restaurants was stated by 17% and 46% of families, respectively. Most families experienced difficulties detecting gluten from the food label. Proposed factors for improvement of quality of life were: better labelling of gluten-containing ingredients (76%) and more gluten-free (GF) foods in supermarkets (58%) and restaurants (42%). CONCLUSIONS: Children with CD have low compliance with the GFD. Better education about the disease, the availability of GF products, and appropriate food labelling could improve compliance and quality of life.},

To date, the etiology, diagnostic and therapeutic management of eating disorders have not been uniformly determined. The objective of the study is determination of the role of a pediatric endocrinologist in diagnostics and management of eating disorders. MATERIAL: In the years 1992-2007 in Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Endocrinology Chair of Pediatrics, Polish-American Institute of Pediatrics, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland were hospitalized 164 patients with suspected anorexia nervosa, aged 9-20 years, 150 girls, and 14 boys. All girls were included in psychological and dietetic treatment. Additionally, in group of 36 girls, the 3-years observation of bone mineralization changes was performed. METHODS: The indications for hospitalization included the assessment of nutritional status, particularly electrolyte imbalance, cardiovascular complications and nutritional treatment. II. Procedure included on department: 1) Correction of general children's state. 2) Monitoring of cardiovascular system disorders. 3) Nutritional treatment. 4) Differential diagnosis. III. Prevention and treatment of late complications was performed in group of 36 girls. In this group, every 6 months were evaluated: body mass index, duration of secondary amenorrhea, serum sex hormone, IGF-I and cortisol levels and 24-hour urine cortisol. Spine densitometry in the AP projection was performed every 12 months, using a Lunar unit (DEXA). The pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis was introduced in girls with duration of secondary amenorrhea lasted for more than 6 months, with decreased bone mineralization BMD < (-) 1SD and body mass deficit < 20%. 16 girls which did not presented disorders of bone mineralization, or refused treatment have not got the pharmacological treatment, while in 20 girls the pharmacological therapy (calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation and hormonal treatment - Estraderm TTS and Provera 5 mg) was provided. RESULTS: Anorexia nervosa was diagnosed in 150 cases, bulimia in 6 cases, in 2 children was diagnosed celiac disease, in 2 patients adrenal insufficiency, in 1 girl myasthenia, in 1 girl diabetes mellitus type 1, in 1 boy hypothalamo-pituitary tumor and in 1 boy psychosis was diagnosed. The nutritional improvement was evaluated in group of 36 girls, which continued treatment in time 3 years. At the beginning of the observation period the mean value of the body mass index (BMI) was 15.95 kg/m2, and after 36 months of the treatment the mean BMI value was 20 kg/m2. Before the treatment one patient was still menstruated despite her body mass loss, 8 girls were pre-menarche, and the remaining 27 patients had secondary amenorrhea of the mean duration of 11.14 months. In the initial period of the follow-up, all the anorectic patients demonstrated a decreased bone mineral density. Before treatment the median Z score in the entire experimental group was (-)1,2 SD whereas after 3 years of treatment value of Z score decreased by 0,5 SD in group of 16 girls without the pharmacological treatment and increased by 0,5 SD in 20 girls on pharmacological treatment. The significant, negative correlation between secondary amenorrhea and Z score value was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The role of a pediatrician in therapeutic management of eating disorders is intervention in life-threatening conditions, treatment of acute complications, differential diagnosis, nutritional treatment, prevention and management of late complications. Because of etiology and special way of treatment the management of anorexia nervosa should have been taken by psychiatrist. The duty of endocrinologists and gynecologists is the late complications treatment, such as an amenorrhea and osteoporosis.},

   abstract = {The enrichment of gluten-free (GF) baked products with dietary fibre (DF) seems to be necessary since it has been reported that coeliac patients have generally a low intake of DF due to their GF diet. Response surface methodology was used to optimize a fibre-enriched GF bread formulation based on corn starch, rice flour and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. Maize fibre and water were the predictor variables (factors), and loaf specific volume, crumb firmness and crumb L value were the dependent variables (responses) used to assess the product quality. The optimal formulation, determined from the data, contained 6.5% maize fibre and 102.5% water, starch/flour base. The developed mathematical models for the measured responses could be successfully used for their prediction during baking. Shelf-life study of the optimized formulation revealed that bread stored under modified atmosphere packaging exhibited lower crumb firmness and moisture content values, and thus remained softer through storage. Scanning electron microscopy of the crumb showed a continuum matrix between starch and maize fibre, in the optimized formulation, obtaining a more aerated structure.},

   abstract = {The latest consensus on celiac disease in 2008, under the auspices of the International Societies of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, shows that HLA DQ2/DQ8 typing indicates the highest negative predictive value for celiac disease, which would exclude the diagnosis of celiac disease. In Romania, there are no studies on the implication of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 in celiac disease in children. The aim of our study was to analyze the significance of genetic tests, with a focus on negative HLA-DQ2/DQ8 cases, as well as to determine the main haplotypes involved in celiac disease in children. We tested in 37 children with old celiac disease, confirmed based on the presence of intestinal villi changes on duodenal biopsy, the IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (TgA-IgA) by ELISA and the IgA anti-endomysium antibodies (EmA-IgA) by indirect immunofluorescence, compared to HLA-DQ2/DQ8 typing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In 25 children, the determined HLA haplotypes predominantly belonged to DQ2, and in 3 children we report the presence of a new haplotype, DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8, formed by pattern 1, DR3-DQ2-the DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0201 alleles, and pattern 5, DR4-DQ8-the DQA1*0301 and DQB1*0302 alleles. In 9 children, genetic tests were negative for celiac disease. The identification of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 provides additional data in the diagnosis of celiac disease, but a rigid algorithm in the diagnosis of celiac disease has no practical applicability.},

METHODS: 20 biopsy specimens from patients with active coeliac disease, 12 from patients with treated coeliac disease, and eight from age-matched controls were evaluated for comparative purposes. Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) populations were analysed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis using group-specific primers. RESULTS: Bacteroides diversity was higher in biopsy specimens from controls than in those from patients with active and treated coeliac disease. Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides fragilis/Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides ovatus were more abundant in controls than in patients with coeliac disease (p<0.05). Bacteroides vulgatus was more frequently detected in controls than in patients with treated coeliac disease (p<0.01). Bacteroides dorei was more common in patients with active coeliac disease than in those with treated coeliac disease and control children (p<0.01). Bifidobacterium diversity was higher in patients with coeliac disease than in controls. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis were more prevalent in patients with active coeliac disease than in patients with treated coeliac disease and control children. A higher LAB diversity was found in patients with treated coeliac disease and controls than in patients with active coeliac disease. Weissella spp and Lactobacillus fermentum were more frequently detected in patients with treated coeliac disease than in controls and patients with active coeliac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and LAB populations in the duodenum of Spanish children with typical coeliac disease (active and treated) and controls differ in diversity and species composition; this could contribute to features of the disease.},

She had severe skin changes with erythema, desquamation, erosions and diffuse hyperpigmentation involving the whole integument, particularly the perioral area, trunk and legs. She also had angular cheilitis, glossitis, conjunctivitis and diffuse alopecia. After treatment with a high-protein gluten-free diet and supplementation with vitamins and microelements there was a rapid improvement in the skin lesions. The severity of the skin lesions in this case can be explained by the coexistence of two metabolic diseases causing complex malnutrition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has been approved for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Placement of gold fiducials is required for real-time tracking and delivery of a high-dose therapeutic beam of radiation to the tumor. Traditionally, fiducials have been placed either intraoperatively or percutaneously. Recently, EUS-guided fiducial placement has been reported, but the safety and feasibility of this approach is not well defined. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the safety, feasibility, and limitations of EUS-guided placement of 0.8 x 5.0 mm fiducials via a 19-gauge needle for locally advanced and recurrent pancreatic cancer. DESIGN: Prospective study of patients with either locally advanced or recurrent pancreatic cancer referred for EUS-guided fiducial placement for SBRT at our institution over a 3-year period. SETTING: Tertiary referral center conducting >1800 EUS procedures annually. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome measurements included success, complications, and technical limitations of EUS-guided fiducial placement in pancreatic cancer. In addition, the percentage of patients successfully completing SBRT after EUS-guided fiducial placement was determined. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients (mean age 73 years; 57% male) with locally advanced (n = 36) and recurrent (n = 15) pancreatic cancer were referred for EUS-guided fiducial placement. Fiducials were successfully placed in 46 patients (90%), with technical failures occurring in 4 patients (8%) with recurrent cancer after pancreaticoduodenectomy. In 3 patients (7%), the fiducials spontaneously migrated from the original site of injection, thereby requiring a second EUS procedure for placement of additional fiducials. Of the 46 patients with fiducials placed under EUS guidance, 42 patients (91%) successfully completed SBRT. Two patients experienced disease progression before SBRT, 1 patient was lost to follow-up, and 1 patient experienced a complication at ERCP that precluded further therapy. Only 1 complication (2%), of mild pancreatitis, occurred in a patient undergoing simultaneous placement of fiducials and celiac plexus neurolysis for intractable abdominal pain. LIMITATIONS: Single-center experience and lack of a formal follow-up protocol to assess for complications. CONCLUSION: EUS-guided fiducial placement for SBRT in locally advanced and recurrent pancreatic cancer is safe and feasible. Successful placement was achieved in 90% of patients, with a low complication rate (2%). Furthermore, 91% of patients successfully completed SBRT after EUS-guided fiducial delivery. Although fiducials can spontaneously migrate from the initial injection site, the rate of migration is relatively low (7%), and no migration-related complications occurred over the course of this study. Limitations to EUS-guided fiducial placement may include surgically altered anatomy (pancreaticoduodenectomy) in patients with recurrent pancreatic cancer.},

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Clinical, serological, histo-pathological and nutritional findings were integrated into an ad hoc created scoring system. Weight gain was monitored during the study observation window. RESULTS: Twenty-eight presumptive celiac patients were identified among those assisted. CD diagnosis was as follows: Confirmed: 17.9% (Score: 9.2 +/- 0.4); Highly likely: 60.7% (Score: 6.6 +/- 1.1); Non-conclusive: 32.1% (Score: 4.7 +/- 0.5); respectively. Ninety-two point eight percent of subjects were malnourished at the moment of the first interview. Total intestinal villi atrophy was observed in less than one-third of the identified celiac patients. Tittering of antibodies associated with CD was as follows: Anti-gliadin: Completed: 25; Positive: 72.0%; Anti-transglutaminase: Completed: 11; Positive: 54.5%. Nutritional replenishment actions comprised: Diet gluten withdrawal (100.0%); Vitamins and minerals prescription (92.9%); supplementary Enteral Nutrition (57.2%); and Parenteral Nutrition (21.4%). Weight gain was of 400 grams in 80.8% of CD patients after 33.7 days of follow- up; and of 700 grams in 13 of them after 321 days. The scoring system presented in this study could be useful for diagnosis and treatment of CD: a condition that keeps baffling physicians and nutritionists alike.},

Celiac disease (CD) is an enteropathy caused by an aberrant immune response to cereal gluten proteins and the only therapy is the adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). In this context, a preliminary study was conducted to establish whether the GFD in itself could modify the composition and immune properties of the gut microbiota. The trial included 10 healthy subjects (30.3 years-old), which were submitted to a GFD over one month. Analysis of fecal microbiota and dietary intake indicated that numbers of healthy gut bacteria decreased, while numbers of unhealthy bacteria increased parallel to reductions in the intake of polysaccharides after following the GFD. Fecal samples of subjects under a GFD, which represent an altered microbiota, also exerted lower immune stimulatory effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells than those of subjects on a regular gluten-containing diet. This addendum presents further discussion on the rationale behind these findings, limitations of the study and possible consequences of dietary counselling in the care process of celiac disease patients.},

Subjects affected by CD cannot tolerate gluten protein, a mixture of storage proteins contained in several cereals (wheat, rye, barley and derivatives). Gluten free-diet remains the cornerstone treatment for celiac patients. Therefore the absence of gluten in natural and processed foods represents a key aspect of food safety of the gluten-free diet. A promising area is the use of minor or pseudo-cereals such as amaranth, buckwheat, quinoa, sorghum and teff. The paper is focused on the new definition of gluten-free products in food label, the nutritional properties of the gluten-free cereals and their use to prevent nutritional deficiencies of celiac subjects.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract possesses a huge epithelial surface area and performs many different tasks. Amongst them are the digestive and absorptive functions. Disorders of intestinal absorption and secretion comprise a variety of different diseases, e.g. coeliac disease, lactase deficiency or Whipple's disease. In principle, impaired small intestinal function can occur with or without morphological alterations of the intestinal mucosa. Therefore, in the work up of a malabsorptive syndrome an early small intestinal biopsy is encouraged in conjunction with breath tests and stool analysis to guide further management. In addition, there is an array of functional tests, the clinical availability of which becomes more and more limited. In any case, early diagnosis of the underlying pathophysiology is most important, in order to initiate proper therapy. In this chapter, diagnostic procedure of malabsorption is discussed with special attention to specific disease like coeliac disease, Whipple's disease, giardiasis and short bowel syndrome. Furthermore, bacterial overgrowth, carbohydrate malabsorption and specific nutrient malabsorption (e.g. for iron or vitamins) and protein-losing enteropathy are presented with obligatory and optional tests as used in the clinical setting.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine current evidence for dietary supplementation with zinc and other micronutrients for primary prevention of multiple micronutrient deficiencies that are known to result from therapies used in the treatment of gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological observations and clinical findings have strengthened the concept that both nutritional deficiencies and nutritional excesses impair the gastrointestinal response(s) and alter susceptibility to inflammation and other diseases. The interaction of micronutrient intake, biochemical indicators of nutritional status, and four specific gastrointestinal inflammation states are reviewed. These conditions include celiac disease and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies resulting from the sustained adherence to a gluten-free diet; micronutrient nutrition as an important determinant of immunity for two major types of inflammatory bowel disease: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; and HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies which may be exacerbated by the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy. SUMMARY: For each inflammation 'state', enhancement of micronutrient status can improve immunocompetance and minimize therapeutic side-effects. The impact of single-micronutrient deficiencies on immune responses, and the possible impact of uncorrected micronutrient status are discussed.},

Owing to the increasing prevalence, prevention strategies, including encouragement of breastfeeding and introduction of small amounts of gluten whereas still on breastfeeding at fourth to sixth month of age, become more important than before. For avoiding complications of celiac disease, a strict gluten-free diet is essential. A lifelong gluten-free diet may bring about difficulties as avoiding gluten completely is problematic owing to the contamination with gluten of presumably gluten free foods. New therapeutic approaches include enzyme supplementation, correction of the intestinal barrier defect against gluten entry, blocking of gliadin presentation by human leukocyte antigen blockers and tissue transglutaminase inhibitors.},

Its success depends partly on its adaptability and high yield potential but also on the gluten protein fraction which confers the viscoelastic properties that allow dough to be processed into bread, pasta, noodles, and other food products. Wheat also contributes essential amino acids, minerals, and vitamins, and beneficial phytochemicals and dietary fibre components to the human diet, and these are particularly enriched in whole-grain products. However, wheat products are also known or suggested to be responsible for a number of adverse reactions in humans, including intolerances (notably coeliac disease) and allergies (respiratory and food). Current and future concerns include sustaining wheat production and quality with reduced inputs of agrochemicals and developing lines with enhanced quality for specific end-uses, notably for biofuels and human nutrition.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent auto-immune enteropathy, triggered in genetically predisposed individuals by the ingestion of dietary gluten. Gluten is the alcohol-soluble protein component of the cereals wheat, rye and barley. CD is a multifactorial condition, originating from the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. The necessary environmental trigger is gluten, while the genetic predisposition has been identified in the major histocompatibility complex region on chromosome 6p21, with over 90% of CD patients expressing HLA DQ2 and the remaining celiac patients express DQ8. The fact that only about 4% of DQ2/8-positive individuals exposed to gluten develop CD, has led to the recognition that other genetic and environmental factors are also necessary. In the last few years, several epidemiological studies have suggested that the timing of the introduction of gluten, as well as the pattern of breastfeeding, may play an important role in the subsequent development of CD. Here, we present and review the most recent evidences regarding the effect of timing of gluten introduction during weaning, the amount of gluten introduced and simultaneous breastfeeding, on the development of CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an increasingly diagnosed, permanent autoimmune enteropathy, triggered, in susceptible individuals, by the ingestion of gluten, the alcohol - soluble protein fraction of some cereals, such as wheat, rye and barley. The main protein of wheat gluten is called gliadin, the similar proteins of rye and barley are secalin and hordein, respectively. Approximately 96% of CD patients express the HLA molecule DQ2, while the remainder mostly express the less common haplotype DQ8, reflecting the pivotal role of these molecules in the pathogenesis of CD. Because of their aminoacid sequence and tri-dimensional structure, gluten peptides selectively bind to these HLA alleles present on the surface of antigen presenting cells and then they are presented to the T lymphocytes in intestinal mucosa, thus starting the inflammatory immune response. CD is defined by the characteristic histological changes of small bowel mucosa: villous atrophy, crypts hyperplasia and T cells infiltration of the lamina propria, along with the increase of the number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. The withdrawal of the gluten- containing food from the diet determines a complete recovery of the intestinal mucosa, whereas the reintroduction causes a relapse of the disease. This review focuses on the description of gluten peptides that elicit the mucosal immune response via the activation of innate and adaptive immunity in CD. It also describes the antagonist gluten peptides, obtained by artificial modification of gluten T epitopes or naturally occurring in the alcohol protein fraction of a cultivar of durum wheat, able to immuno-modulate the pathogenic immune response of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The small intestine is an important human organ that plays a central role in many physiological functions including digestion, absorption, secretion and defense. Duodenal pathologies include, for instance, the ulcer associated to Helicobacter Pylori infection, adenoma and, in genetically predisposed individuals, celiac disease. Alterations in the bowel reduce its capability to absorb nutrients, minerals and fat-soluble vitamins. Anemia and osteopenia or osteoporosis may develop as a consequence of vitamins malabsorption. Adenoma is a benign tumor that has the potential to become cancerous. Adult celiac disease patients present an overall risk of cancer that is almost twice than that found in the general population. These disease processes are not completely known.To date, a two dimensional (2D) reference map of proteins expressed in human duodenal tissue is not yet available: the aim of our study was to characterize the 2D protein map, and to identify proteins of duodenal mucosa of adult individuals without duodenal illness, to create a protein database. This approach, may be useful for comparing similar protein samples in different laboratories and for the molecular characterization of intestinal pathologies without recurring to the use of surgical material. RESULTS: The enrolled population comprised five selected samples (3 males and 2 females, aged 19 to 42), taken from 20 adult subjects, on their first visit at the gastroenterology unit for a suspected celiac disease, who did not turn to be affected by any duodenal pathology after gastrointestinal and histological evaluations. Proteins extracted from the five duodenal mucosal specimens were singly separated by 2D gel electrophoresis. After image analysis of each 2D gel, 179 protein spots, representing 145 unique proteins, from 218 spots tested, were successfully identified by MALDI-TOF ms analysis. Normalized volumes, for each protein, have been reported for every gel. Proteins have been grouped according to their biological/metabolic functions. CONCLUSION: This study represents to date the first detailed and reproducible 2D protein map of human duodenum. Spots identifications, reported in a database, will be helpful to identify the variability in protein expression levels, in isoforms expression, or in post-translational modifications associated to pathology or to a therapy.},

   abstract = {In celiac disease (CD), for its multifactorial nature, the target organs are not limited to the gut, but include thyroid, liver, skin and reproductive and nervous systems. Between the extraintestinal symptoms associated with CD, autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs) are more evident, underlining as CD-related autoimmune alterations can be modulated not only by gluten but also by various concurrent endogenous (genetic affinity, over-expression of cytokines) and exogenous (environment, nutritional deficiency) factors. In their pathogenesis a central role for over-expression of interleukin-15 (IL-15) is shown, by inhibiting apoptosis, leading to the perpetuation of inflammation and tissue destruction. Thyroid is particularly sensitive to selenium deficiency because selenoproteins are significant in biosynthesis and activity of thyroid hormones; besides, some selenoproteins as glutathione peroxidase are involved in inhibiting apoptosis. Thus, selenium malabsorption in CD can be thought as a key factor directly leading to thyroid and intestinal damage. Considering the complexity of this interaction and on the basis of available evidence, the aim of this review is to assess as preventive and therapeutic target the role of IL-15 and selenium in the pathogeneses of both CD and AITD.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety children between 18 months and 18 years of age (median 9 years) with CP were included. Antibodies (IgA and IgG) against gliadin (AGA), endomysium (EMA), and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) were measured. Children with elevated levels of these antibodies were offered a small-bowel biopsy. RESULTS: Thirty-nine children showed an elevated level of 1 or more of the tested antibodies (43%). None had raised EMA antibodies. Presence of tetraplegia or dyskinesia was associated with increased antibody levels (P=0.045), as was a more severe functional type of CP (P=0.008). Children with elevated antibodies had a lower body weight (P=0.049), height (P=0.041), and body mass index (BMI) (P=0.014). Small-bowel biopsies were performed in 27 out of 39 children; 1 had CD and 2 had intraepithelial lymphocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of children with CP had elevated AGA and/or anti-tTG. Because these elevations were associated with lower weight, height, and BMI, it seemed of interest to speculate on how these findings correlated to CP and CD. However, we found no correlation between CP and CD.},

   abstract = {It seems obvious to healthcare professionals that patients with coeliac disease should receive regular follow-up. Surprisingly, there is little evidence that patients benefit in terms of reduced morbidity or mortality. However, several authoritative bodies have published guidelines on the management of coeliac disease that recommend regular follow-up. There is good evidence that compliance with a gluten-free diet reduces the risk of complications such as osteoporosis or small bowel lymphoma. Compliance is enhanced particularly by education about the disease and the gluten-free diet and by support from peers or professionals. Such input can be provided by regular follow-up, which thereby should improve compliance and hence long-term health. The consensus of the recommendations for follow-up suggests an annual review by a physician and dietitian. At annual follow-up the disease status can be checked and nutritional advice can be given, including checking the adequacy of, and the compliance with, the gluten-free diet. Complications and associated medical conditions can be sought, genetic risks explained and support and reassurance given. Specialist dietitians have particular expertise in relation to diet and nutritional management; specialist clinicians have a broader range of expertise in many aspects of management of the disease. A team approach for providing follow-up is the ideal, with a clinician and dietitian, both with expertise in coeliac disease, being involved. No one particular group of healthcare professionals is necessarily better than the other at providing follow-up.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Enterocyte apoptosis induced by activated intraepithelial lymphocytes is increased in coeliac disease (CD). Serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 (SGK1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that may inhibit apoptosis and compensate for the excessive death of surface epithelial cells. The significance of SGK1 in CD is elusive so far. The aim of this study was to characterise the expression and localisation of SGK1 in duodenal biopsy samples taken from children with untreated CD, children with treated CD, and controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Duodenal biopsy specimens were collected from 16 children with untreated CD, 9 children with treated CD, and 10 controls. The mRNA expression of SGK1 was determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. SGK1 and phosphorylated (P)-SGK1 protein levels and their localisation were determined by Western blot and immunofluorescent staining, respectively. RESULTS: We found increased SGK1-mRNA expression as well as higher SGK1 and P-SGK1 protein levels in the duodenal mucosa of children with untreated CD compared with controls. In the duodenal mucosa of children with treated CD, SGK1-mRNA expression was decreased and SGK1 and P-SGK1 protein levels were lower than in untreated CD. SGK1 and P-SGK1 staining intensity was stronger in duodenal villous enterocytes of children with untreated CD compared with treated CD. CONCLUSIONS: Our results of increased expression of SGK1 in untreated CD may suggest its contribution to the enterocyte survival in this disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Heat shock protein (HSP) 72, a known chaperone, has potential epithelial barrier protecting, antiapoptotic, and immune system regulatory effects; therefore, our aim was to study its involvement in the pathology of celiac disease (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Duodenal biopsy specimens were collected from children with untreated and treated CD and from controls. mRNA expression, protein level, and localization of HSP72 were determined. RESULTS: Elevated HSP72 mRNA expression and higher protein levels were found in the duodenal mucosa of children with untreated CD as well as in children with treated CD compared with those in controls. In the duodenal mucosa of children with treated CD, HSP72 mRNA expression was decreased and HSP72 protein levels were lower than those in children with untreated CD. We detected intensive HSP72 staining in the villous enterocytes and immune cells of the lamina propria in the duodenal villi of children with untreated CD compared with that in controls. CONCLUSIONS: The increased expression and altered localization of HSP72 in CD indicate that HSP72 should have a role in protection against gliadin-induced cytotoxicity. HSP72 may exert antiapoptotic effect and contribute to preservation of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. Moreover, HSP72 as a ligand of TLR2 and TLR4 may promote innate immune responses and warn the cells of the potential injury.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a common disease in the Saharawi population of Arab-Berber origin. Saharawi patients with CD and their families were invited to participate in a follow-up study aimed at checking the CD serology status in patients being treated with the gluten-free diet (GFD) and investigating the prevalence of CD in first-degree relatives. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated 975 subjects (62.8% females and 37.2% males, age range 0.7 to 75.4 years, median age 13.4 years) belonging to 212 families, by determining the serum immunoglobulin A anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibody levels. Thirty-two first-degree relatives were already receiving GFD when tested. RESULTS: Overall, 42.2% of the 244 treated subjects with CD showed a borderline/positive anti-transglutaminase determination, and 36.6% were also anti-endomysial positive. The serologic family screening detected 33 previously undiagnosed CD cases. The 65 affected first-degree relatives were sibling (42), mother (12), son/daughter (7), and father (4). The overall prevalence of CD among first-degree relatives was 65 of 763 (8.5%, 95% confidence interval 6.5-10.5). Based on our previous estimate of CD prevalence in the pediatric Saharawi population (5.6%), the sibling relative risk was 1.5. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of CD in the Saharawis is only modestly increased in first-degree relatives compared with the general population, probably because of the higher frequency of CD predisposing genes in the general population. Saharawi patients with CD receiving GFD showed poor adherence to the treatment, which could contribute to residual CD-related morbidity and mortality.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abdominal pain is the most common indication for oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) in children. However, existing studies examining the diagnostic outcomes of OGD in children with abdominal pain are limited. AIM: To examine the diagnostic yield of OGD with biopsy in the evaluation of abdominal pain and to describe the endoscopic and histological findings in patients undergoing OGD for abdominal pain of unclear aetiology. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional cohort study in children under 18 years of age who had OGD for the primary indication of abdominal pain, at Texas Children's Hospital and Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters from 1 January 2002 to 30 June 2005. RESULTS: Overall, OGD was diagnostic in 454 (38.1%) of the 1191 procedures, including reflux oesophagitis (23%, n = 271), Helicobacter pylori infections (5%, n = 55), peptic ulcers (3%, n = 32), eosinophilic oesophagitis (2%, n = 25), celiac disease (1%, n = 9) and Crohn's disease (0.5%, n = 7). Male gender, older age, elevated C-reactive protein and vomiting were associated with increased diagnostic yield. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that OGD is valuable for the evaluation of chronic abdominal pain in children, with a diagnostic yield of 38%. The majority of alarm symptoms and routine laboratory tests are not significantly associated with diagnostic yield.},

Serological screening of the family members of index cases was done and those showing positivity for the screening tests were further subjected to endoscopic duodenal biopsy for histopathological examination. RESULTS: A total of 164 members of 50 celiac families were initially screened for antibodies. Antibody picked up 32.9% by IgG anti-gliadin (AGA), 20.7% by endomysial antibody, 19.5% by tissue transglutaminase and 14.6% IgA AGA as seropositive for CD. Endoscopic findings characteristics for CD were present in only eight family members. CONCLUSION: Family members of CD cases represent potential cases of CD.},

It takes special skill, patience and insight to interview the elderly, as well as to appreciate their altered physiology and interpretation of their presenting symptoms and signs, often against an extreme background of complex medical problems. The maldigestion and malabsorption coupled with altered motility contributes to the development of malnutrition. There generally a decrease of function of the GI tract, but there may be loss of adaptability in response to changes in diet or nutritional stress. Pathological alterations which might lead to minor overall intestinal functional variations in the young because of a normal process of adaptation, may lead to much more serious events in the elderly.},

   abstract = {Gastric reflexes are mediated mainly by vago-vagal reflex circuits in the caudal medulla. Despite the fact that brainstem vago-vagal circuitry remains intact after spinal cord injury (SCI), patients with SCI at the cervical level most often present gastric stasis with an increased risk of reflux and aspiration of gastric contents. Using a miniature strain gauge sutured to the gastric surface; we tested gastric motility and reflexive gastric relaxation following oesophageal distension (oesophageal-gastric relaxation reflex) in animals 3 days after a severe spinal contusion at either the third or ninth thoracic spinal segment (acute T3- or T9 SCI, respectively). Both basal gastric motility and the oesophageal-gastric relaxation reflex were significantly diminished in animals with T3 SCI. Conversely, both basal gastric motility and the oesophageal-gastric relaxation reflex were not significantly reduced in T9 SCI animals compared to controls. The reduced gastric motility and oesophageal-gastric reflex in T3 SCI rats was not ameliorated by celiac sympathectomy. Our results show that gastric stasis following acute SCI is independent of altered spinal sympathetic input to the stomach caudal to the lesion. Our data suggest that SCI may alter the sensitivity of vagal reflex function, perhaps by interrupting ascending spinosolitary input to brainstem vagal nuclei.},

   abstract = {Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type II (APS-II) is the most common immunoendocrinopathy syndrome. APS-II is defined by the development of two or more of the following entities: primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), Graves' disease, type 1A diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyroiditis, primary hypogonadism, celiac disease, and myasthenia gravis. Other frequent clinical findings are vitiligo, alopecia, pernicious anemia and/or serositis. Primary adrenal insufficiency in these patients affects the adrenal cortex, which is destroyed by autoantibodies against 21-hydroxylase. Unlike other causes of adrenal insufficiency (infectious diseases, infiltrative diseases, bleeding, tumors), the adrenal medulla is not involved. Pheochromocytomas are tumors arising from the chromaffin cells of the sympathetic nervous system in the adrenal medulla. The clinical symptoms of these tumors vary from isolated hypertension or hypertension accompanied by paroxysmal episodes -including the classical triad of headache, palpitations and diaphoresis-to potentially serious manifestations such as acute pulmonary edema, arrhythmias and sudden death. Nevertheless, up to 40% of affected patients are asymptomatic. We present the case of a patient diagnosed with APS-II who developed a pheochromocytoma. In this patient, the adrenal gland cortex was atrophied and the tumor was attached to the adrenal medulla. This coexistence of endocrinopathies, with no etiologic connection, is a surprising finding, which has not previously been described in the current literature.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: : Given dietary gluten exposure, growing children with celiac disease may experience malabsorption of nutrients, negatively affecting bone health. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of low bone mass in children with celiac disease, according to the presence of symptoms at diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : A retrospective chart review of the Stollery Children's Hospital Celiac Clinic charts (April 1989-September 2007) was conducted. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the spine was measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Demographics, symptoms at presentation, and anthropometric and biochemical data relevant to bone health were recorded. RESULTS: : Seventy-four children (9.6 +/- 3.7 years; range 3.3-16.0 years) were included. Lumbar BMD z scores more than or equal to -1 were observed in 58 cases (65%), z scores below -1 but above -2 were observed in 14 cases (19%) and z scores less than or equal to -2 were observed in 12 cases (16%). There was no significant difference in mean lumbar BMD z scores between symptomatic and asymptomatic children (P = 0.34). When adjusted for bone age and bone surface area, BMD lumbar z score was inversely correlated with age at diagnosis (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: : An equivalent reduction in spine bone mass was observed in children with celiac disease at diagnosis regardless of the presence of symptoms. Delayed diagnosis of children with celiac disease may increase the risk of adult osteoporosis. Appropriate screening of children at risk of celiac disease for the purpose of early diagnosis, as well as routine evaluation of bone mineral density in such children, are important to prevent long-term complications associated with poor bone health.},

The patient's neurologic symptoms preceded the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma by 11 months. These symptoms improved after surgical removal of the tumor and chemotherapy. The small cell carcinoma was relatively small and was not associated with gallstones. In spite of the small size of the tumor, it metastasized to a celiac lymph node and probably to the liver. Anti-Hu paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy should be added to the list of paraneoplastic syndromes associated with small cell carcinoma of the gallbladder.},

We reviewed clinical records of 149 children with CD followed in our institution between 1991 and 2007, considering weight, height and body mass index (BMI), both at diagnosis and after at least 12 months of gluten-free diet (GFD). In all, 11% of patients had BMI z-score >+1 and 3% were obese (z-score >+2) at presentation. In our population, there was a significant (P=0.008) increase in BMI z-score after GFD and the percentage of overweight (z-score >+1) subjects almost doubled (11 vs 21%, P=0.03). Our data suggest the need for a careful follow-up of nutritional status after diagnosis of CD, especially addressing those who are already overweight at presentation.},

The aims of this retrospective study were to assess the prevalence of false-positive tTG titers in patients at risk of CD compared with symptomatic children and to evaluate the influence of age and indication for testing on tTG titers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All tTG results measured in our institution during a 33-month period were evaluated. Patients with known CD were excluded. Indications for testing were either symptoms suggestive of CD (group 1) or history of being at risk for CD (group 2). Duodenal biopsies were recommended if titers were positive (> or =10 U/mL) and offered if borderline (> or =4 to <10 U/mL). RESULTS: The final analysis included 2056 patients, 1707 belonged to group 1, and 349 to group 2. All 65 patients with positive tTG results underwent biopsy (group 1: 57, group 2: 8). Celiac disease was confirmed in 61 subjects (median titer: 107.8 U/mL, range 12.0-1748 mL, NS between group 1 and 2), whereas 4 had normal histology (10.2-25.2 U/mL). Three out of 16 patients with borderline results underwent biopsy and had normal histology. Borderline titers were more common in group 2 patients (2.6% vs 0.4%, P<0.001). Multiple regression analysis in patients with negative tTG results (n=1975) revealed that titers were independently related to age (P<0.05) and indication for testing (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The influence of age and genetic predisposition/risk has to be taken into account when interpreting tTG results.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Celiac disease (CD) is a T cell-mediated chronic autoimmune enteropathy occurring in genetically susceptible individuals, and manifested by a permanent intolerance to gluten-containing products. CD commonly presents in children as failure to thrive and malabsorption or after screening high-risk groups such as people with diabetes. Almost half of adult patients with CD have a body mass index (BMI) >25 at diagnosis. Classic symptoms like diarrhea are less common in obese patients. Few children have been reported with CD and obesity. Because many children with newly diagnosed CD are identified by screening high-risk groups, obesity is more common than previously suspected. The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of obesity at diagnosis in children with CD and to describe the clinical characteristics of this group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 143 patients with CD diagnosed between 1986 and 2003 at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. Data collected included patient's age, sex, ethnicity, presenting signs and symptoms, BMI, celiac antibody titers, small-intestinal biopsy results, and follow-up weight 1 year after initiating a gluten-free diet (GFD). RESULTS: Seven of the 143 (5%) patients had BMI >95th percentile. The most common presenting symptoms among obese patients were abdominal pain, diabetes, and diarrhea. Symptoms improved in all of the patients on a GFD. BMI decreased in 4 (50%), increased in 2 (25%), and was not available in 1 patient at 1 year after starting on GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is more common in children with CD than previously recognized. In the appropriate clinical setting, CD must be considered even in obese children.},

The aims of the present study were to define confocal features of celiac disease (CD) and to evaluate the usefulness of the CLE in the diagnosis of CD in children in comparison to histology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients (8 girls) with a median age of 8.35 years (range 2-12.66 years) and a median weight of 28.3 kg (range 11-71 kg) were suspected with CD and 10 matched controls underwent oesophagogastroduodenoscopy using the confocal laser endomicroscope (EC3870CILK; Pentax, Tokyo, Japan). Histologic sections were compared with the confocal images of the same site by 2 experienced paediatric histopathologists and endoscopists, all of whom were blinded to the diagnosis. RESULTS: The median procedure time was 17 minutes (range 8-25 minutes). Confocal features of CD were defined and a score was developed. A total of 1384 confocal images were collected from 9 patients and 10 controls. Five images from each patient and control were selected and compared with the biopsy specimen of the same site. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for the confocal images in comparison to the histology were 100%, 80%, and 81%. The kappa inter-observer agreement between the 2 endoscopists was 0.769 (P = 0.018) and between the 2 histopathologists was 0.571 (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Confocal endomicroscopy offers the prospect of diagnosis of CD during ongoing endoscopy. It also enables targeting biopsies to abnormal mucosa and thereby increasing the diagnostic yield, especially when villous atrophy is patchy in the duodenum.},

Four independent variables DCHF, QF, ammonium bicarbonated (AB) and baking time (BT) at three levels each one were considered in orden to evaluate their effects on the sensory quality (SQ) and signal to noise ratio (S/N) of the optimized product. To determine the optimun levels and relative magnitude of the effects of each parameter L9 3(4) orthogonal array with nine design points and two replications each totalizing eighteen experimental runs was used. Results were analyzed using differences between the average values of each factor according to the working level and also analysis of variance (ANOVA). The desired characteristics were the maxima SQ and S/R responses, so Taguchi "the larger the better" performance formula was used. Optimun conditions turn out to be DCHF 24.3%; QF 7.1%; AB 0.6%; BT 22 minutes. Among the chemical characteristics highlighted components such as protein (8.9%) and fiber (12.7%). Regarding the prolamine content of 1.5 ppm its result was under the limit considered for CODEX (20 ppm) classifying this product as gluten free. On the other hand, the shelf life study expressed as conjugated dienes (CD) was 3.6% after 45 days at 30 degrees C storage conditions proving this product is stable to rancidness. Hedonic test data shown 100% approval, splitted as follow 75% (like very much) and 25% (like). Finally 100% of celiac peoples inquired in this study were well disposed to buy this product.},

The present study deals with variation in the immune response of mucosal T-cells from celiac children to prolamins extracted from nine landraces of farro wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccum) with contrasting storage protein compositions. METHODS: The prolamin fraction from nine 'dicoccum' wheat landraces was subjected to peptic-tryptic digestion and supplied to T-cells from mucosal explants of four celiac patients. Immune reactions in terms of cell proliferation and INF-gamma secretion by intestinal T lymphocytes were then determined. RESULTS: T-cell lines exposed to digested prolamins from landraces L5563, L5558 and L5540 showed negligible proliferative responses and released INF-gamma amounts similar to that of untreated control cells. By contrast, landraces Ersa 6, Ersa 8, Leonessa 4 and Leonessa 5 proved to be very active in triggering the immune responses, whereas landraces Filosini and Prometeo exhibited an intermediate behavior. One-dimensional fractionations by A-PAGE or SDS-PAGE revealed distinctive prolamin patterns amongst the landraces analysed. CONCLUSIONS: 'Dicoccum' wheat represents a heterogeneous species showing a wide variation in both prolamin composition and T-cell immunological activation, some 'dicoccum' landraces being poor in or devoid of noxious gluten proteins.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Defensins are expressed in epithelial cells as cationic peptides with antimicrobial properties. Because of their role as immunologically important effector molecules, their contribution in maintaining a stable microenvironment in the gastrointestinal tract has recently received much attention. The present study was designed to further characterize expression patterns of defensins in diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract in children, particularly in Helicobacter pylori (Hp)-associated gastritis or celiac disease (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Semiquantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out with gene-specific primers for human beta-defensin 1 to 6 (hBD1 to 6) and human alpha-defensin 5 and 6 (hD5 and 6) in mucosal biopsies of children diagnosed as having CD (n = 11; 4.2-16.2 years) or Hp gastritis (n = 18; 3.2-16.7 years). Levels of expression were compared with those of healthy individuals (n = 21; 2.8-14.6 years). Expression levels in Hp-infected specimens were furthermore compared with those with histologic inflammation not associated with Hp infection (n = 30; 3.6-15.7 years). RESULTS: Expression of hBD2 was upregulated in the antrum and corpus of patients with Hp gastritis, whereas inflammation without detection of Hp was not associated with any change in defensin gene expression. In patients with CD, expression of hBD2 was upregulated in the antrum, whereas hBD1 and 4 were downregulated in duodenal biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Different pathological conditions of the upper gastrointestinal tract lead to specific modulations of defensin gene expression in children. Especially the pathophysiological role of hBD2 in Hp infection and hBD1 and 4 in CD warrant further attention.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Regulatory T (Treg) cells together with intestinal microflora play a central role in controlling allergic inflammation. We examined the markers related to Treg cells, and bacterial signaling, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR)-2 and -4, in the duodenal mucosa of patients with food allergy (FA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Small intestinal samples were collected from patients with FA on a normal or an elimination diet, from healthy controls and patients with untreated celiac disease. Single and double immunohistochemistry were used to enumerate the densities of Foxp3-positive cells and TLR2- and TLR4-positive cells in the mucosa and evaluate the colocalization of Foxp3 expression in CD4, CD25, and CTLA-4 cells. The mRNA expression of CD25, Foxp3, TLR2, and TLR4 was measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The densities of Foxp3 and TLR4 cells were significantly increased in patients with untreated FA compared with healthy controls (P = 0.003, P = 0.033), and the Foxp3 cells were higher in untreated than in treated allergic patients (P < 0.001). The immense majority of Foxp3 cells were CD4 (median 100%), CTLA-4 (100%), or CD25 (81%). The ratio of Foxp3 mRNA to Foxp3 cells was decreased in patients with FA and in patients with celiac disease compared with controls (P = 0.036, P = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Foxp3 cells are increased in the duodenum of patients with untreated FA, but these cells are not able to suppress the harmful immune response, indicated by the low expression of Foxp3 transcripts. The increase of TLR4 cells and their correlation with TCRgammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes suggest a role for the innate immunity and intestinal microbiota in FA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The only therapy for coeliac disease (CD) is a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD). Little is known about the detailed composition of such a diet. AIM: To clarify the nutritional composition of a GFD and to compare it with a non-GFD diet in representative non-CD populations. METHODS: A total of 139 consecutive patients with CD were invited to fill in a prospective validated 5-day food diary, of whom data from 93 were analysed. Results were compared with data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey of Adults and the UK Women's Cohort Study (UKWCS). RESULTS: Individuals consuming a strict GFD generally had similar intakes of energy and nutrients to those of comparison populations, but a higher proportion of carbohydrate intake was obtained from nonmilk extrinsic sugars and intakes of nonstarch polysaccharides were low. Compared with the UKWCS sample, female patients adhering to a GFD had lower intakes of magnesium, iron, zinc, manganese, selenium and folate. In male patients, intakes of magnesium and selenium were particularly low. CONCLUSIONS: This study reinforces the need for clinicians to recognize that avoidance of gluten cannot be the sole focus of a gluten-free diet. Maintenance of adequate intakes of essential nutrients and in particular complex carbohydrates must also be the goal for patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In the diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD), gluten challenge is recommended for children under the age of 2 years at initial biopsy. The aim of the study was to investigate the diagnostic yield of gluten challenge in this group of children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included children aged 2 years or younger who were analysed for possible CD and who had villous atrophy at initial small bowel biopsy in the period 1993-2004. We subsequently identified all patients who underwent a complete gluten challenge. RESULTS: We identified 333 children with possible CD. In 100 children (30%), a gluten challenge was performed, with the diagnosis being confirmed in 97. Retrospectively, in 2 of the 3 children without mucosal relapse, data available before gluten challenge did not justify the initial diagnosis of CD. In the third patient, transient gluten intolerance could not be excluded. At first biopsy, the 2 children without mucosal relapse had negative serological parameters, whereas the third patient had IgA antigliadin antibodies, but no IgA anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA). Indeed, all of the patients with EMA at diagnosis had a relapse at gluten challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Routine gluten challenge in children younger than 2 years at initial diagnosis of CD has an extremely low diagnostic yield. We suggest that routine gluten challenge in this group of patients is not necessary when patients have villous atrophy in combination with EMA. Therefore, a revision of the current diagnostic criteria has to be considered.},

Agents commonly used in clinical practice, including tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, and pregabalin, have remained largely unsatisfactory in treating this pain. We report the case of a 50-year-old woman presenting with chronic unrelenting abdominal pain due to severe diabetic gastroparesis that was managed successfully with coeliac plexus block with local anaesthesia and steroid injection. Adequate analgesia was achieved and maintained for 10 weeks following the coeliac plexus block, which allowed elimination of opiate requirements for pain management (and avoidance of narcotic associated constipation), continuation of percutaneous endoscopy jejunostomy tube feedings, and avoidance of long term parenteral nutrition.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an antibody-mediated enteropathy that presents permanent intolerance to ingested gluten. Currently, only one kind of treatment is available: the complete dietary elimination of all sources of gluten. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of replacing gluten with psyllium on sensory characteristics of bread dough and to compare the chemical, nutritional, technological, and sensory characteristics of the modified preparations. This study is experimental and was subdivided into five steps: selection and development of preparation, chemical analysis, sensory analysis, and statistical analysis. Modified samples of the bread dough achieved a 93.0% acceptance rate for individuals with celiac disease and up to 97.0% for individuals without celiac disease. The most affected characteristics were odor and texture. In terms of chemical composition of the bread dough, energy was reduced by 32.1% and the fat fraction was 42.3% before being cooked. Data obtained from sensory analysis of psyllium doughs indicate that the products had good acceptance by individuals with celiac disease as well as by individuals without celiac disease. This suggests that psyllium can replace gluten in preparations. Furthermore, in terms of chemical composition, products made with modified dough had less fat and fewer calories.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Celiac disease is an extremely common, although underdiagnosed, disorder. Knowledge about the varied clinical manifestations and the proper approach to screening and diagnosing celiac disease will lead to appropriate early intervention in affected children RECENT FINDINGS: New age-dependent algorithms are emerging to properly screen for celiac disease. There is new evidence on the patchy nature of celiac disease supporting the practice of multiple duodenal biopsies including the bulb of the duodenum. Therapeutic dietary compliance, particularly in asymptomatic children, can be poor, and therefore, the involvement of a dietician trained in celiac disease is instrumental in keeping patients up to date with dietary guidelines and to improve their compliance to the diet. Expanding knowledge about the pathogenesis of celiac disease has led to the development of investigational therapeutic alternatives to the gluten-free diet. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating methods of celiac disease prevention in at-risk infants. SUMMARY: This review aims at outlining the different manifestations of celiac disease in children as well as a step-wise approach to screen and diagnose the disease. A better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of celiac disease is paving the way to innovative diagnostic tools, preventive strategies, and therapeutic interventions alternative to a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coeliac disease (CD) is associated with immune-mediated skin diseases such as dermatitis herpetiformis and others. The objective of the study was to investigate the relation of body mass index (BMI), as an index of absorptive status, with the prevalence of skin diseases in adults with untreated CD. METHODS: Anthropometry, gastro-intestinal symptoms, nutritional indices and immune-mediated skin diseases (dermatitis herpetiformis, psoriasis, aphthosis and alopecia) at diagnosis were analysed. RESULTS: 223 men and 924 women with untreated CD (aged 20-60 years) were included, the commonest skin disease was dermatitis herpetiformis (18.4 and 6.9%, respectively), the rarest one was alopecia (1.8 and 2.1%). The BMI was positively associated with male gender, age at diagnosis and nutritional indices, negatively with diarrhoea and dyspepsia (p < 0.001). A BMI difference of 3.5 (1 standard deviation) was related to an excess prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis (odds ratio, OR = 1.46, 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.23-1.72) and of psoriasis (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.10-1.79) but not of other immunological disorders. Findings were similar in analyses by gender or age group and controlled for gender and age. The relation of BMI to dermatitis herpetiformis was linear over the whole BMI range, also excluding overweight patients. The relation of BMI to psoriasis was flat for low-to-normal BMI and explained only by overweight patients. CONCLUSION: In CD at diagnosis, the BMI is positively related to the prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis and psoriasis, not to that of other immune-mediated skin diseases.},
