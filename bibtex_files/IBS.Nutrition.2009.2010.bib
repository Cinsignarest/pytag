   abstract = {Gastrointestinal disturbances (particularly diarrhea) are often induced in response to cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. Oral chemotherapeutic agents can induce diarrhea by damaging the intestinal lining. Two common oral drugs used in cancer treatment that are known to have gastrointestinal side effects are capecitabine and lapatinib. In this brief communication, the authors discuss a case study of a stage IV breast cancer patient whose chemotherapy-induced diarrhea was treated successfully with a multispecies combination of probiotics. This is a unique study in which grade 3 chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (characterized by 7-9 stools per day and associated with incontinence and abdominal cramping) was treated with only a multispecies combination of probiotics. Probiotics have been used to treat diarrhea in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, and Crohn's disease. More recently, probiotics have been used to treat chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in colon cancer patients. This case study demonstrates that the probiotics can also be used to treat severe cases of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in breast cancer patients. The use of different probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases is an increasingly important area of study, and more research into this area is needed. This study demonstrates that probiotics should be considered for advanced breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.},

   abstract = {Abstract Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), frequently associated with psychological distress, is characterized by hypersensitivity to gut wall distension. Some probiotics are able to alleviate IBS symptoms and reduce visceromotor response to mechanical stimuli in animals. Moreover, we have previously shown that Lactobacillus farciminis treatment abolished the hyperalgesia to colorectal distension (CRD) induced by acute stress. The aims of the present study were to determine whether (i) stress-induced visceral hyperalgesia modifies the expression of Fos, a marker of general neuronal activation, induced by CRD, (ii) this activation can be modulated by L. farciminis treatment. Female rats were treated by L. farciminis and CRD was performed after partial restraint stress (PRS) or sham-PRS. The expression of Fos protein was measured by immunohistochemistry. After CRD or PRS, Fos expression was increased in spinal cord section (S1), nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, and in the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA). The combination of both stimuli, PRS and CRD, markedly increased this Fos overexpression in the sacral spinal cord section, PVN and MeA, but not in NTS. By contrast, a pretreatment with L. farciminis significantly reduced the number of Fos positive cells in these area. This study shows that PRS enhances Fos protein expression induced by CRD at the spinal and supraspinal levels in rats. Lactobacillus farciminis treatment inhibited this enhancing effect, suggesting that the antinociceptive effect of this probiotic strain results from a decrease of the stress-induced activation/sensitization of sensory neurons at the spinal and supraspinal level.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic abdominal pain is a common complaint in childhood and adolescence. Despite decades of clinical observations and research, it still poses a challenge to pediatric health care professionals. The aim of this review is to highlight the epidemiology of pediatric chronic abdominal pain and to describe the pathogenesis of this disorder, its clinical manifestations, evaluation and therapeutic options. DATA SOURCES: Articles on chronic abdominal pain in the recent years from PubMed, MEDLINE, and reference textbooks were reviewed. RESULTS: Chronic abdominal pain, a functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID), is a multifactorial condition that results from a complex interaction between psychosocial and physiologic factors via the brain-gut axis. A thorough history coupled with a complete physical examination and normal screening studies rule out an organic cause in 95% of the cases. It is highly important for the physician to establish a trusting relationship with the child and parents because successful treatment including modification of physical and psychological stress factors, dietary changes, and drug therapy depends greatly on education, reassurance and active psychological support. CONCLUSIONS: FGIDs are a cause of great anxiety, distress and morbidity in children as well as adults. As our understanding of these conditions improves, our therapeutic interventions will progress not only to overcome them but also to intervene early in the disease course so as to limit long-term impact.},

   abstract = {Visceral hypersensitivity is regarded as an important factor in the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Assessment of visceral sensitivity has several important aims: increasing the understanding of normal and abnormal visceral sensory mechanisms and participating sensory pathways, serving as diagnostic tool to detect patients with abnormal visceral sensitivity, and evaluating therapeutic interventions directed towards modification of visceral sensitivity. Current stimulation modes in sensitivity tests include mechanical distension by barostat or tensostat, nutrient drink or water load, chemical stimulation, e.g. acid provocation or capsaicin ingestion, electrical, or thermal stimulation. Multimodal probes incorporating several stimulation modes in one device have recently been developed. Assessment of visceral sensation can be based on subjective responses of conscious perception or on objective parameters such as visceromotoric responses or central sensory processing patterns. All methods face the challenge that visceral sensitivity may be influenced by a wide spectrum of different factors, including the test techniques themselves, and improved, preferably non-invasive sensitivity tests with a greater standardisation and a broader applicability are still needed.},

   abstract = {Elevated colonic luminal serine-protease (Ser-P) activity of diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) patients evokes a proteinase-activated receptor (PAR)-2-mediated colonic hypersensitivity in mice. Despite similarly elevated Ser-P levels in feces, patients with IBD exhibit visceral hypo- or normosensitivity to rectal distension, as opposed to IBS-D. To explain these discrepancies we studied the effect of colonic infusion of fecal supernatants from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients to colorectal mechanical sensitivity of mice and explored the involvement of PAR-4 and its activator Cathepsin-G (Cat-G). Fecal protease activities were assayed in healthy subjects, IBS-D and UC patients in presence or not of antiproteases or Cat-G inhibitor. Following intracolonic infusion of fecal supernatants from healthy subjects, IBS-D and UC patients or PAR-4 activating peptide (PAR-4-AP) or Cat-G, EMG response to colorectal balloon distension was recorded in mice. This nociceptive response was also determined after treatment with pepducin (PAR-4 antagonist) on UC supernatant or after a preincubation with antiproteases or Cat-G inhibitor. In contrast to IBS-D supernatant, UC supernatant promoted colonic hyposensitivity to distension, an effect mimicked by PAR-4-AP or Cat-G. UC supernatant-induced hypoalgesia was inhibited by a cocktail of antiproteases. However, blockade of PAR-4 or Cat-G inhibition resulted in colonic hypersensitivity similar to that observed after IBS-D supernatant infusion. Despite similarly elevated Ser-P activities, IBS-D and UC fecal supernatant display visceral pro- and antinociceptive effects in mice, respectively. Visceral hyposensitivity induced by fecal supernatant from UC patients results from PAR-4 activation by cathepsin-G, counterbalancing the pronociceptive effect of simultaneous PAR-2 activation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lactose malabsorption (LM), the inability to break down lactose into glucose and galactose, is due to a deficiency in the small intestinal lactase phlorizin hydrolase enzyme. Ethnic and geographic variations of LM are known. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of LM in healthy southern and northern Indian populations. DESIGN: A total of 153 healthy volunteers (76 from southern and 77 from northern India) were evaluated for LM by using a lactose tolerance test (LTT), a lactose hydrogen breath test (lactose HBT), and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism to identify the lactase gene C/T-13910 polymorphism (confirmed by sequencing). RESULTS: Volunteers from southern and northern India were comparable in age and sex. The LTT result was abnormal in 88.2% of southern Indians and in 66.2% of northern Indians (P = 0.001). The lactose HBT result was abnormal in 78.9% of southern Indians and in 57.1% of northern Indians (P = 0.003). The CC genotype was present in 86.8% and 67.5% (P = 0.002), the CT genotype was present in 13.2% and 26.0% (P = 0.036), and the TT genotype was present in 0% and 6.5% (P = 0.03) of southern and northern Indians, respectively. The frequency of symptoms after the lactose load (47.4% compared with 15.6%; P < 0.001) and peak concentrations of breath hydrogen (88.5 +/- 71.9 compared with 55.4 +/- 61.9 ppm; P = 0.003), both of which might indicate the degree of lactase deficiency, were higher in southern than in northern Indians. CONCLUSION: The frequency and degree of LM is higher in southern than in northern Indian healthy populations because of genetic differences in these populations.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits, not sustained by structural changes. There is now consistent evidence indicating that IBS may be the adverse outcome of an acute episode of infectious gastroenteritis, the so-called postinfectious (PI) IBS. The infectious agents involved in the development of PI-IBS include pathogenic bacteria, parasites, and viruses. Abdominal pain and diarrhea are the most common symptoms of PI-IBS. Several studies identified a number of risk factors increasing the susceptibility for PI-IBS development. These include the virulence of the pathogen, the severity, and duration of the acute enteritis, younger age, female sex, and psychological disturbances. Several mucosal abnormalities in the colon or ileum of patients who develop PI-IBS have been described. These changes include increased mucosal permeability, an increased amount of intraepithelial lymphocytes, lamina propria T cells, and mast cells, as well as serotonin-containing enteroendocrine cells. The mediators released by these activated cells may evoke enteric nervous system responses, excite sensory afferent pathways, and induce visceral hyperalgesia. Little is known about the prognosis of PI-IBS, although it is likely better than that of nonspecific IBS. There is little evidence about a specific treatment for PI-IBS. Although probiotics and antibiotics may be promising in the prevention of PI-IBS, the efficacy of these treatments should be assessed in an ad hoc designed study.},

   abstract = {Neonatal stress is a common early life event which alters the development of the endocrine and immune systems. Specifically, exposure to neonatal stress results in alterations to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis resulting in offspring who hyper-respond to stress in adulthood. Recently, this concept has been applied to the ontogeny of functional gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The high prevalence of this disorder and the ineffectiveness of current treatments results in high direct and indirect costs to the society. Recently, administration of probiotics to neonates has been used as a safe and cost-effective preventative strategy to revoke the long term unfavourable imprinting induced on the gastrointestinal system by early life stressors in animal models of human IBS. It is not as yet known however, whether maternal supplementary probiotics may also contribute to improved GI integrity and gut-associated immune functioning in stressed neonates, if these possible improvements persist into adulthood, or how this protective effect may be mediated. Our hypothesis is an attempt to link this proposed nutritional approach and its possible preventive effects against GI dysfunctions provoked by neonatal stress.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal was to compare the predictive values of the Prometheus Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Serology 7 (IBD7) panel (Prometheus Laboratories, San Diego, CA) with the predictive values of routine blood tests in a population of children referred for initial evaluation of suspected IBD. METHODS: Medical records of pediatric patients referred for evaluation of IBD for whom IBD7 testing was performed at Prometheus Laboratories between January 2006 and November 2008 were reviewed. Patients underwent diagnosis by pediatric gastroenterologists on the basis of clinical, radiologic, endoscopic, and pathologic evaluations. RESULTS: A total of 394 records were identified. We excluded 90 records on the basis of age of >21 years, previous diagnosis of IBD, or unclear diagnosis. The prevalence of IBD in this cohort was 38%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and kappa value for the serological panel were 67%, 76%, 63%, 79%, and 42%, respectively, compared with values for a combination of 3 abnormal routine laboratory test results of 72%, 94%, 85%, 79%, and 47%. The antiflagellin antibody assay, the newest assay added to the panel, had sensitivity of 50% and specificity of 53%. Repeat serological testing failed to produce consistent results for 4 of 10 patients. CONCLUSION: Despite its recent inclusion of the antiflagellin assay, the IBD7 panel has lower predictive values than routine laboratory tests in pediatric screening for IBD.},

We hypothesized that obesity is associated with a poor long-term prognosis in children with FGIDs. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study in an outpatient clinic-based sample of patients diagnosed with abdominal pain-related FGIDs. Principal outcome measured was persistence of pain at long-term follow-up (12-15 months). Frequency of pain, intensity of pain, school absenteeism and disruption of daily activities were compared between obese and non-obese subjects. RESULTS: The group mean age was 13.27+/-3.84 years, distribution of diagnosis was 32% (functional abdominal pain), 42.5% (irritable bowel syndrome) and 25.5% (functional dyspepsia). Overall, 20.2% of patients were obese. A total of 116 patients (61.7%) reported abdominal pain and 72 (38.3%) were asymptomatic at long-term follow-up. Obese patients were more likely to have abdominal pain (P<0.0001), higher intensity of pain (P=0.0002), higher frequency of pain (P=0.0032), school absenteeism (P<0.0001) and disruption of daily activities (P<0.0001) at follow-up than non-obese patients. CONCLUSION: Obesity is associated with poor outcome and disability at long-term follow-up in children with abdominal pain-related FGIDs. Our novel findings could have important implications in the prognosis and management of FGIDs.},

The classical approach targeting first bowel movement alterations or motility disorders using spasmolytic agents has to be replaced by visceral antinociceptive drugs. Several mediators and receptors involved in gut hyperalgesia have already been identified. Serotonin (5-HT), tachykinins, CCK, NGF, and other mediators are involved in experimental models of gut hyperalgesia, and related receptor antagonists have already been introduced in clinical trials. However, IBS is associated with mucosal immune stimulation, considered a microinflammatory state associated with increased density of immunocytes and mast cells, offering new targets. Altered mucosal barrier permeability with increased entry of toxins and bacteria is considered to be responsible for the mucosal microinflammation. Endogenous but predominantly luminal factors have been identified as factors responsible for such altered permeability. These clinical data have opened the door to promising future drugs able to prevent or blunt such permeability alteration, which therefore may constitute a pathophysiological treatment for IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Adults with irritable bowel syndrome may often have a first-degree relative with abdominal pain and bowel problems. The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in parents and siblings of children affected by FGIDs, the psychological profile of both children and parents affected by FGIDs, and whether independent factors could influence the prevalence of FGIDs in parents of children with and without FGIDs. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred three patients affected by FGIDs according to Rome III criteria and/or their parents and siblings filled out validated questionnaires for gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, depression, and anxiety. These patients were compared with 65 age- and sex-matched controls referred to the Primary Care Center of the Department of Paediatrics at the University of Naples "Federico II" for non-GI symptoms. RESULTS: The parents of children with FGIDs showed a significantly (P < 0.0001) higher prevalence of FGIDs compared with the parents of children without FGIDs. No significant differences between the groups were observed for marital status, parental occupation, education level, standard of living, and presence of anxiety and/or depression. An association between the children's and their parents' type of GI disorders was found in 33.9% (35/103) of patients. In particular, an association between the children's and mother's type of GI disorders was found in 25.2% (26/103) of patients. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate that a large number of mothers of children with FGIDs have the same FGIDs as their children.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the evidences for the usefulness of dietary manipulations (including the use of probiotics and prebiotics) in the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). RECENT FINDINGS: Exclusion diets do not have a role in the management of these patients except in the case of malabsorbed sugars (lactose, fructose). However, recent work suggests that excluding these sugars is more effective in non-IBS than in IBS patients. Also, the first small open series on the use of very low (20 g/day) carbohydrate diet (VLCD) in IBS has been published with promising results. However, safety concerns do not allow us to recommend them. In the period of review, further evidence has been provided on the role of psyllium in IBS. Also, the available evidence on the use of probiotics in IBS has been meta-analyzed. SUMMARY: IBS patients should eat a balanced diet without restrictions, and (except for malabsorbed sugars) exclusion diets are not useful in most of them. The role of VLCD remains to be established. The concept that increasing fiber intake is useful for IBS may not be true for all patients, and hydrophilic colloids (e.g. psyllium) are preferred. There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of probiotics in IBS.},

   abstract = {Recent in-depth studies of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that assessed multiple physiological endpoints in large patient cohorts confirm evidence of abnormal motility, sensation, and psychosocial disturbances. However, the proportion with hypersensitivity has dropped from the time of the original claim that it is a "biological marker" of IBS. Discomfort thresholds in male and female IBS patients normalize over time, whereas IBS symptoms persist, and increased colonic sensitivity in IBS is strongly influenced by a psychological tendency to report pain and urge rather than increased neurosensory sensitivity. The objectives of this article are to review the classical pathophysiology of IBS, the putative roles of infection, inflammation, and bacterial flora; consider mimics of IBS; assess the evidence that IBS is a serotonergic disease; evaluate recent advances in membrane biology and neuroscience related to IBS; consider genetic association with IBS and its endophenotype; and discuss whether to treat the gut or the brain.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a four week kiwifruit intervention on bowel function in patients diagnosed with IBS/C. Fifty-four patients with IBS/C and 16 healthy adults participated in this study. All subjects participated in the 6 week, three phase study, which included a baseline phase (1 week), a dietary intervention period (4 weeks), and a post-intervention phase (1 week). Forty-one IBS/C patients and all healthy adults consumed two Hayward green (Actinida deliciosa var) kiwifruits per day for 4 weeks. Thirteen IBS/C patients in the control group took two placebo capsules per day for 4 weeks. Colon transit time was measured immediately prior to and following the intervention period. All subjects completed daily defecation records. After the 4-week intervention, weekly defecation frequency significantly increased in the IBS/C group of participants who consumed kiwifruit (p<0.05). Colon transit time significantly decreased (p=0.026) in the IBS/C group that consumed kiwi fruit. These findings suggest that kiwifruit consumption for 4 weeks shortens colon transit time, increases defecation frequency, and improves bowel function in adults diagnosed with IBS/C.},

   abstract = {Irregularities of serotonin function in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be due to changes in the metabolism of the serotonin precursor l-tryptophan. Dietary alteration of tryptophan intake may impact upon the mood and bowel symptoms of IBS. We hypothesized that diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (d-IBS) patients would exhibit an increase in plasma tryptophan due to alterations in tryptophan metabolism. We also hypothesized that a diet low in tryptophan would reverse this change and reduce symptoms. Thirteen patients with d-IBS had fasting serum free and total tryptophan, large neutral amino acids, and 6 kynurenine metabolites measured before and after 2 weeks of a strict dairy-free diet. Baseline tryptophan parameters were compared with an age- and sex-matched control group. Changes in the specific tryptophan parameters before and after dairy-free diet were correlated with symptoms of IBS and mood. Compared with the control group, d-IBS patients at baseline exhibited significantly higher free serum tryptophan (10.5 +/- 4.35 vs 4.75 +/- 2.43 mumol/L [means +/- standard deviation], P = .006) and significantly lower tryptophan dioxygenase and total tryptophan oxidation as measured by the kynurenine to free tryptophan and total kynurenines to free tryptophan ratios (23.37 +/- 10.12 vs 55.33 +/- 16.02, P < .001 and 49.34 +/- 17.84 vs 258.46 +/- 98.67, P < .001, respectively). Dairy-free diet did not modulate metabolites of the kynurenine pathway or symptoms. Tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway is inhibited in d-IBS, and a dairy-free diet does not alter this. Our findings are consistent with possible enhanced serotonin activity in d-IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Proteasome-mediated protein degradation may contribute to the regulation of intestinal inflammation. At the same time, low-grade inflammation and increased intestinal permeability seem to be involved in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Thus, we aimed to evaluate proteasome composition and activities in colonic mucosa of IBS patients and its putative pathogenic role. METHODS: Proteasome activities and proteasome subunit expression were measured in colonic mucosa of IBS, Crohn's disease (CD), and control patients by fluorometric assays and western blot, respectively. Expression of inhibitor of kappa B factor (IkappaB alpha) and occludin, a tight junction protein, was also evaluated in colonic biopsies. The degradation of recombinant occludin incubated with protein extracts from colonic mucosa was evaluated in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibitor, MG132. RESULTS: Proteasome trypsin-like activity was increased in IBS patients compared with CD and controls, whereas chymotrypsin-like activity was upregulated in CD patients only. Caspase-like activity was reduced both in IBS and CD patients. IkappaB alpha expression was similar between IBS and controls. In contrast, occludin expression was lower in IBS than in controls, but occludin mRNA level was similar. Protein extracts from IBS patients but not from controls degraded recombinant occludin (20% over 160 min), which was blocked by MG132. Although mast cell number was increased in IBS patients, no correlation was found between this number and proteasome alterations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that proteasome alterations are present in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients and may contribute to the pathophysiology of IBS by increasing occludin degradation.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota plays an important role in host health due to its involvement in nutritional, immunologic and physiological functions. Microbial imbalances have been associated with enhanced risk of specific diseases. This observation has allowed the introduction of microorganisms as probiotics which are microbes with demonstrated health benefits in humans when ingested in foods. The mechanisms of action include the inhibition of pathogen growth by competition for nutritional sources and adhesion sites, secretion of antimicrobial substances, toxin inactivation. Consequently, the primary clinical interest in the application of probiotics has been in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal infections and antibiotic-associated diarrhea diseases. The well-characterized immunomodulatory potential of specific probiotic strains, beyond the effect on the composition of the microbiota, has been be used as innovative tools to alleviate intestinal inflammation, normalize gut mucosal dysfunction, and down-regulate hypersensitivity reactions. Clinical efficacy of specific probiotic strains has been demonstrated in, rotavirus's diarrhea, antibiotic associated diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome and food allergies. Further, recent clinical and nutritional studies have uncovered the function of specific strains in energy metabolism and thereby have opened up new angles on their exploitation. However, as these processes are highly specific, it is important to characterize the properties of specific probiotic strains an in order to select the best strains or strain combinations for the target in question. Advances have prompted increased the interest of researchers and industry and new applications and targets are being discovered.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic abdominal pain (CAP) in children, a condition that accounts for approximately 25% of pediatric gastroenterology office visits, may be a precursor to irritable bowel syndrome in adults. Recently, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been reported in 78-84% of IBS patients regardless of their abdominal symptoms, compared to 20% in healthy controls. Aims The aim of this study was, therefore, to assess the prevalence of SIBO in children with CAP. METHODS: Seventy-five children aged 8-18 years diagnosed with CAP based on the Rome II criteria and 40 healthy controls were enrolled. All subjects underwent a lactulose breath hydrogen test (LBT) to assess for SIBO. Children with CAP also filled out symptom questionnaires. RESULTS: There was a 91% prevalence of an abnormal LBT suggestive of SIBO in the children with CAP and 35% in controls (odds ratio = 16.7, 95% confidence interval 6.0-57.5, P < 0.0001). A comparison of CAP children with a positive LBT to CAP children with a negative LBT revealed the former had significantly more "urgency to have a bowel movement" (P = 0.049) and experienced less "soiling" (P = 0.016) than those with a negative LBT. No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of the location of their pain or any other associated symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to adults with IBS, there is a significantly higher prevalence of SIBO in children with CAP. Randomized controlled studies are needed to determine if eradication of SIBO will lead to symptom improvement in these patients.},

Furthermore, the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics seem to ameliorate atopic diseases, in particular atopic dermatitis. The efficacy of probiotics has been shown comparable to Mesalazine regarding the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. In addition there is evidence that probiotics are useful in the prevention of pouchitis or in therapy of irritable bowel syndrome.

   abstract = {AIMS: Increased colonic paracellular permeability (CPP) is a key feature of gastro-intestinal disorders as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel diseases. Stress stimulates exocrine pancreatic secretion through cholinergic pathways, and trypsin is known to increase CPP. Consequently we have investigated in this work whether trypsin released into the gut lumen following an acute stress may participate to the short-term increase in CPP. MAIN METHODS: Mice were treated with atropine or a non-selective CRF (corticotropin-releasing factor) receptor antagonist (alpha-helical CRF (9-41)), before being submitted to a 2-h stress session. Then, CPP and protease activity in colonic contents (total proteolytic, trypsin activity, and mouse mast cell protease (MMCP)-1 levels) were determined. The effects of colonic contents from sham-stressed or stressed animals on CPP were evaluated in mice colonic tissues mounted in Ussing chambers, in presence or not of soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) or FSLLRY, a protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) antagonist. KEY FINDINGS: Acute stress significantly increased CPP, proteolytic and trypsin activities, and MMCP-1 levels. Atropine inhibited stress-induced impairment of CPP and strongly diminished total proteolytic and trypsin activities in stressed animals, but not MMCP-1 levels. Colonic contents from stressed animals increased CPP in mice tissues, this effect being inhibited by SBTI and PAR2 antagonist. SIGNIFICANCE: Acute stress activates cholinergic pathways, to trigger exocrine pancreatic secretion. Trypsin, released in these conditions, may be responsible for colonic barrier alterations through the activation of PAR2.},

   abstract = {In irritable bowel syndrome, the main objectives of the treatment are the relief of abdominal pain then the improvement of bowel disturbances. Spasmolytic agents, or clays remain routinely the first line pharmacological options. The efficacy of dietary recommendations is not validated in most of the cases while dietary fibers, mainly insoluble fibers, may even worsen abdominal discomfort. In C-IBS, osmotic laxatives or macrogol are effective to improve colonic transit while loperamide and also colestyramine can be prescribed to reduce the number of stools of D-IBS patients. When the first line treatment fails to improve symptoms, antidepressants (tricyclic rather than SSRs) can be prescribed at lower doses than that recommended for depression. In meta-analysis, the odds ratio for pain relief varies from 2 to 4 and strongly depends on the patient's compliance to the treatment. Probiotics, pregabalin and even antibiotics (i.e neomycin, metronidazole or rifaximin), are possible new therapeutic options. Few clinical trials suggest that ramosetron (a new 5HT3 antagonist), octreotide, melatonin, or lidocain could be also discussed in the future. A non pharmacological therapeutic approach has to be considered, particularly in patients with severe symptoms, in combination with pharmacological treatment.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome is not only a digestive motor disorder. It is a multifactorial disease for which many data have highlighted the pathophysiological importance of visceral hypersensitivity in the onset of symptoms, particularly abdominal pain. Hypersensitivity is due either to an afferent neurons disfunction at the enteric nervous system level, either to an abnormal brain-gut axis processing of sensory or nociceptive inputs arising from the gut, at the spinal or supraspinal level. Disturbances of the autonomic nervous system occur in IBS as a consequence of this brain-gut axis dysfunction. Neurological abnormalities may be triggered by inflammation, mast cell dysfunction or increased intestinal permeability while the neuro-immune consequences of stress (mainly chronic) play a major role in the genesis and the maintenance of irritable bowel syndrome. The role of emotions and mood disturbances cannot be omitted in the interpretation the central processing of digestive sensory inputs. Neurosciences, in particular brain imaging techniques, have contributed to this better understanding of irritable bowel syndrome pathophysiology. It is likely to play a major role in the future to improve our knowledge of the brain-gut axis function (mechanisms, neurotransmitters and receptors involved both in normal and pathological conditions). This knowledge is crucial because of the need for updated treatment strategies and new pharmacological and/or cognitive or behavioral therapies.},

In almost 20% of the patients, IBS is clearly a post-infectious IBS as a consequence of an acute bacterial gastroenteritis. Some papers have reported an abnormal colonic fermentation in IBS patients that could explain symptoms such as bloating and be one of the factors triggering visceral hypersensitivity. More recently, significant differences in the composition of both the luminal and mucosa-associated microbiota have been reported between both IBS patients and healthy controls and IBS subgroups while some arguments exist for a small intestinal overgrowth in a subset of IBS patients. All these arguments for a deleterious role of the gut microbiota lead to the actual discuss to consider new therapeutic options, including mainly pre- and probiotics and maybe antibiotics.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The composition of the fecal mircoflora and its changes on ageing have rarely been investigated in large samples of both patients and volunteers. METHODS: We analysed the fecal flora by conventional microbiological testing (Kyberstatus, Institute of Microecology, Herborn, Germany) of stool samples from 35 292 adults (age: 46.3 +/- 0.08 [18 to 96] years, 9564 males, 24 784 females; remaining = missing data) with different intestinal and non-intestinal diagnoses for total colony-forming units (CFU) (per g stool) as well as relative abundance of Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides spp., Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., and Lactobacillus spp. with respect to age, gender, and clinical data available (e. g., stool consistency and pH). RESULTS: The total CFU was stable and showed no age- or gender-related changes. Individual bacterial species constantly and significantly increased with age (E. coli, Enterococci spp.), or decreased at higher age (Bacteroides spp.), or were stable throughout the life span (Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria). Gastrointestinal diagnoses (Crohn's disease, n = 198; ulcerative colitis, n = 515; irritable bowel syndrome, n = 7765; other GI diagnoses, n = 10 478) tended to exhibit some specificity of the bacterial profile, and when GI diagnoses were excluded, the age-related bacterial profile of the remaining group (n = 15 619, m:f = 4197:11 422) was not different. CONCLUSION: Conventional microbiological investigations of the fecal microbiota showed both bacteria-specific as well as a general pattern of ageing of the colonic microbiota, with the last decades (more than 60 years) demonstrating the most profound changes. It remains to be shown whether these changes reflect direct changes of the gut microbiota, the mucosal innate immunity, or indirect consequences of age-related altered nutrition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Serotonin transporter (SERT) plays a critical role in regulating serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) availability in the gut. Elevated 5-HT levels are associated with diarrheal conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and enteric infections. Whether alteration in SERT activity contributes to the pathophysiology of diarrhea induced by the food-borne pathogen enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is not known. The present studies examined the effects of EPEC infection on SERT activity and expression in intestinal epithelial cells and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Caco-2 cells as a model of human intestinal epithelia and EPEC-infected C57BL/6J mouse model of infection were utilized. SERT activity was measured as Na(+) and Cl(-) dependent (3)[H] 5-HT uptake. SERT expression was measured by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence studies. RESULTS: Infection of Caco-2 cells with EPEC for 30-120 minutes decreased apical SERT activity (P < .001) in a type 3 secretion system dependent manner and via involvement of protein tyrosine phosphatases. EPEC infection decreased V(max) of the transporter; whereas cell surface biotinylation studies revealed no alteration in the cellular or plasma membrane content of SERT in Caco-2 cells. EPEC infection of mice (24 hours) reduced SERT immunostaining with a corresponding decrease in SERT messenger RNA levels, 5-HT uptake, and mucosal 5-HT content in the small intestine. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate inhibition of SERT by EPEC and define the mechanisms underlying these effects. These data may aid in the development of a novel pharmacotherapy to modulate the serotonergic system in treatment of infectious diarrheal diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Linaclotide is a novel, orally administered investigational drug currently in clinical development for the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic constipation. Visceral hyperalgesia is a major pathophysiological mechanism in IBS-C. Therefore, we investigated the anti-nociceptive properties of linaclotide in rodent models of inflammatory and non-inflammatory visceral pain and determined whether these pharmacological effects are linked to the activation of guanylate cyclase C (GC-C). METHODS Orally administered linaclotide was evaluated in non-inflammatory acute partial restraint stress (PRS) and acute water avoidance stress (WAS) models in Wistar rats, and in a trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced inflammatory model in Wistar rats and GC-C null mice. KEY RESULTS In TNBS-induced colonic allodynia, linaclotide significantly decreased the number of abdominal contractions in response to colorectal distension without affecting the colonic wall elasticity change in response to distending pressures after TNBS. However, linaclotide had no effect on visceral sensitivity under basal conditions. In addition, linaclotide significantly decreased colonic hypersensitivity in the PRS and WAS models. In wild type (wt) and GC-C null mice, the instillation of TNBS induced similar hyperalgesia and allodynia. However, in post-inflammatory conditions linaclotide significantly reduced hypersensitivity only in wt mice, but not in GC-C null mice. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES These findings indicate that linaclotide has potent anti-nociceptive effects in several mechanistically different rodent models of visceral hypersensitivity and that these pharmacological properties of linaclotide are exerted through the activation of the GC-C receptor. Therefore, linaclotide may be capable of decreasing abdominal pain in patients suffering from IBS-C.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are defined as "live microorganisms which confer a health benefit on the host" when administered in adequate amounts, and have potential effects for maintaining intestinal development, nutrition, and treating intestinal inflammations, functional disorders, and other extra-intestinal diseases. Although the benefits of probiotics for human health were first noted over 100 years ago, the analysis of probiotic functions began in earnest only 20 years ago. Probiotics, such as some strains of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis, inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria, induce competitive effects for the adherent of pathogenic bacteria and their toxins to intestinal epithelia, induce cytoprotective heat shock proteins, enhance the intestinal barrier function, and modulate the host immune responses. The crosstalk between the host and the probiotics appears to be mediated by bacteria-derived effectors, which can be sensed with multiple systems, including the Toll-like receptors and cell membrane transporters. Future analyses will identify more probiotic-derived effectors, the recognition mechanisms of these effectors, and the subsequent changes of the intestinal epithelia and immune cells for each probiotic treatment. For clinical use, a procedure that objectively evaluates the ability of each probiotic effect will help establish a standard for choosing the most valuable strain and its proper dose for each individual patient.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: : Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common problem in pediatrics, for which no safe and effective treatment is available. Probiotics have shown some promising results in adult studies, but no positive study has been published on pediatric age. We aimed at investigating the efficacy of VSL#3 in a population of children and teenagers affected by IBS, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study conducted in 7 pediatric gastroenterology divisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: : Children 4 to 18 years of age, meeting eligibility criteria, were enrolled. The patients were assessed by a questionnaire for a 2-week baseline period. They were then randomized to receive either VSL#3 or a placebo for 6 weeks, with controls every 2 weeks. At the end, after a "wash-out" period of 2 weeks, each patient was switched to the other group and followed for a further 6 weeks. RESULTS: : A total of 59 children completed the study. Although placebo was effective in some of the parameters and in as many as half of the patients, VSL#3 was significantly superior to it (P < 0.05) in the primary endpoint, the subjective assessment of relief of symptoms; as well as in 3 of 4 secondary endpoints: abdominal pain/discomfort (P < 0.05), abdominal bloating/gassiness (P < 0.05), and family assessment of life disruption (P < 0.01). No significant difference was found (P = 0.06) in the stool pattern. No untoward adverse effect was recorded in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: : VSL#3 is safe and more effective than placebo in ameliorating symptoms and improving the quality of life in children affected by IBS.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the 2 distinct idiopathic pathologies of inflammatory bowel diseases, are spontaneously relapsing, immunologically mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Selected probiotics strains have been proven to be clinically effective in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. None of the probiotics thus far tested has been shown to be effective in induction of remission or in maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease. The multispecies probiotics mixture of 8 strains seems effective in the maintenance of remission in pouchitis. Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional bowel disorder manifested by chronic, recurring abdominal pain or discomfort associated with disturbed bowel habit in the absence of structural abnormalities likely to account for these symptoms. Recently conducted appropriately powered studies with different (combinations of) probiotics show positive results on reduction of symptoms, although a considerable placebo effect is also found. Mechanistic studies aimed at pathophysiological mechanisms of inflammatory bowel diseases can identify new targets for probiotic bacteria.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of referred children with nonorganic abdominal pain who meet the criteria for 1 or more diagnoses of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), explore the distribution of diagnoses according to the revised pediatric Rome III criteria (PRC-III), and to investigate reasons for failure to meet these criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited children (4-15 years) consecutively referred by general practitioners to 4 general pediatric outpatient clinics for the evaluation of recurrent abdominal pain. FGID diagnoses were based on the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III version, completed by parents. To exclude organic disease, all patients underwent medical investigations and were reevaluated at follow-up after 6 to 9 months. RESULTS: Of the 152 patients included, 142 (93%) had functional abdominal pain. Of these, 124 (87%) met the criteria for 1 or more diagnoses according to the PRC-III: 66% met the criteria for 1, 29% for 2, and 5% for 3 diagnoses. Irritable bowel syndrome was the most common diagnosis (43%) and overlapped with aerophagia in 16 children (38% of the children with overlapping diagnoses) and with abdominal migraine in 14 (33%). In the 18 patients (13%) not fulfilling the PRC-III for any FGID diagnosis, the main reason was insufficient pain frequency (83%). CONCLUSIONS: Of the referred children with functional abdominal pain, 87% met the PRC-III for specific diagnoses. This supports the use of these criteria as a diagnostic tool. The significant overlap between different FGIDs, however, makes it unclear whether some of the diagnoses represent distinct disorders or artificial categories.},

   abstract = {The incretin effect of the gut peptide hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a combined result of inhibition of gastric emptying and stimulation of insulin secretion via an incretin mechanism. The temporal pattern of these events implicate that gastric emptying is primarily delayed, while later in the digestive process insulin is released for nutrient disposal. Since the inhibitory effect of GLP-1 on gastric motility is very outspoken, we considered it of value to study its effects on gut motility. Animal experimentation in the rat clearly showed that not only gastric emptying, but also small bowel motility with the migrating myoelectric complex was profoundly inhibited by GLP-1 at low doses. Similar effects were seen with analogues of the peptide. Extending the studies to man supported our earliest data indicating that the migrating motor complex of the small intestine was affected, and even more noticeable, the summarized motility index inhibited. Further extension of our studies to patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) displayed similar results. This encouraged us to embark on a clinical pain-relief multi-centre study in IBS patients using a GLP-1 analogue, ROSE-010, with longer half-life than the native peptide. The outcome of the IBS study proved ROSE-010 to be superior to placebo with a pain-relief response rate of 24% for ROSE-010 compared to 12% for placebo. Taken together, the GLP-1 analogue ROSE-010 is believed to cause relaxation of the gut and can thereby relieve an acute pain attack of IBS, even though its precise mechanism is yet to be defined.},

   abstract = {Gastrointestinal (GI) motility, primarily gastric emptying, balances the hormonal output that takes place after food intake in order to maintain stable blood sugar. The incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), work together to reduce postprandial hyperglycemia by glucose-dependent insulin secretion and inhibition of glucagon release, as well as inhibition of GI motility and gastric emptying. GLP-1 is considered the more effective of the two incretins due to its additional inhibitory effects on GI motility. It is observed that patients on treatment with GLP-1 analogues or exenatide achieve a considerable weight loss during treatment. This is of benefit to improve insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, weight loss per se is of considerable benefit in an even longer health perspective. The weight loss is considered to be due to the inhibition of GI motility. This effect has been studied in animal experimentation, and from there taken to involve studies on GI motility in healthy volunteers and patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Evolving to a phase II study in IBS, the GLP-1 analogue (ROSE-010) was recently shown to be effective for treatment of acute pain attacks in IBS. Taken together, data speak in favor of GI motility as a central component not only in metabolic disorders but also in IBS, be it due to a direct relaxing effect on GI smooth muscle or a slow emptying of gastric contents resulting in a less outspoken nutritional demand on hormonal regulatory functions in the GI tract.},

Although for some of them an effective therapeutic approach has been found, palliation rather than cure is very frequent due to a partial knowledge of their aetiology and pathogenesis. This review, analyzing the main clinical studies, aims at being a state of the art update of the use of probiotic formulations in daily practice. METHODS: In this review we include all the most significant clinical trials involving the use of probiotic formulations for the treatment of several pathologies. RESULTS: Dysbiosis has been observed in irritable bowel syndrome patients. Probiotics may exert a beneficial effect on Crohn's disease affected patients who have shown gut microbiota antigens and altered wall permeability. Moreover some probiotic formulations seem to enhance the therapy for Helicobacter Pylori reducing its pathogenic potential. Intestinal ecology imbalance has been also linked to cancer induction, allergy, skin and urogenital diseases. In addition probiotics administration seems to be particularly useful to ease post-operative complications. CONCLUSION: Further future clinical trials, involving large numbers of patients, will be mandatory to achieve definite evidence of the preventive and curative role of probiotics in medical practice.},

In response to this urgent need, genotyping has been conducted within the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination (NHANES III), the nationally-representative household-interview health survey in the U.S. However, before these genetic analyses can occur, family relationships within households must be accurately ascertained. Unfortunately, reported family relationships within NHANES III households based on questionnaire data are incomplete and inconclusive with regards to actual biological relatedness of family members. We inferred family relationships within households using DNA fingerprints (Identifiler(R)) that contain the DNA loci used by law enforcement agencies for forensic identification of individuals. However, performance of these loci for relationship inference is not well understood. We evaluated two competing statistical methods for relationship inference on pairs of household members: an exact likelihood ratio relying on allele frequencies to an Identical By State (IBS) likelihood ratio that only requires matching alleles. We modified these methods to account for genotyping errors and population substructure. The two methods usually agree on the rankings of the most likely relationships. However, the IBS method underestimates the likelihood ratio by not accounting for the informativeness of matching rare alleles. The likelihood ratio is sensitive to estimates of population substructure, and parent-child relationships are sensitive to the specified genotyping error rate. These loci were unable to distinguish second-degree relationships and cousins from being unrelated. The genetic data is also useful for verifying reported relationships and identifying data quality issues. An important by-product is the first explicitly nationally-representative estimates of allele frequencies at these ubiquitous forensic loci.},

   abstract = {Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating disease characterized by unexplained disabling fatigue and a combination of accompanying symptoms the pathology of which is incompletely understood. Many CFS patients complain of gut dysfunction. In fact, patients with CFS are more likely to report a previous diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common functional disorder of the gut, and experience IBS-related symptoms. Recently, evidence for interactions between the intestinal microbiota, mucosal barrier function, and the immune system have been shown to play a role in the disorder's pathogenesis.Studies examining the microecology of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract have identified specific microorganisms whose presence appears related to disease; in CFS, a role for altered intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of the disease has recently been suggested. Mucosal barrier dysfunction promoting bacterial translocation has also been observed. Finally, an altered mucosal immune system has been associated with the disease. In this article, we discuss the interplay between these factors in CFS and how they could play a significant role in GI dysfunction by modulating the activity of the enteric nervous system, the intrinsic innervation of the gut.If an altered intestinal microbiota, mucosal barrier dysfunction, and aberrant intestinal immunity contribute to the pathogenesis of CFS, therapeutic efforts to modify gut microbiota could be a means to modulate the development and/or progression of this disorder. For example, the administration of probiotics could alter the gut microbiota, improve mucosal barrier function, decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines, and have the potential to positively influence mood in patients where both emotional symptoms and inflammatory immune signals are elevated. Probiotics also have the potential to improve gut motility, which is dysfunctional in many CFS patients.},

A high index of suspicion is necessary in order to differentiate SIBO from other similar presenting disorders such as coeliac disease, lactose intolerance or the irritable bowel syndrome. A search for predisposing factor is thus necessary. These factors may be anatomical (stenosis, blind loop), or functional (intestinal hypomotility, achlorydria). The hydrogen breath test is the most frequently used diagnostic test although it lacks standardisation. The treatment of SIBO consists of eliminating predisposing factors and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.},

   abstract = {Beta2-1 fructans are carbohydrate molecules with prebiotic properties. Through resistance to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract, they reach the colon intact, where they selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial members of the gut microbiota. Through this modification of the intestinal microbiota, and by additional mechanisms, beta2-1 fructans may have beneficial effects upon immune function, ability to combat infection, and inflammatory processes and conditions. In this paper, we have collated, summarised and evaluated studies investigating these areas. Twenty-one studies in laboratory animals suggest that some aspects of innate and adaptive immunity of the gut and the systemic immune systems are modified by beta2-1 fructans. In man, two studies in children and nine studies in adults indicate that the adaptive immune system may be modified by beta2-1 fructans. Thirteen studies in animal models of intestinal infections conclude a beneficial effect of beta2-1 fructans. Ten trials involving infants and children have mostly reported benefits on infectious outcomes; in fifteen adult trials, little effect was generally seen, although in specific situations, certain beta2-1 fructans may be beneficial. Ten studies in animal models show benefit of beta2-1 fructans with regard to intestinal inflammation. Human studies report some benefits regarding inflammatory bowel disease (four positive studies) and atopic dermatitis (one positive study), but findings in irritable bowel syndrome are inconsistent. Therefore, overall the results indicate that beta2-1 fructans are able to modulate some aspects of immune function, to improve the host's ability to respond successfully to certain intestinal infections, and to modify some inflammatory conditions.},

   abstract = {A number of studies have been performed examining the influence of various probiotic organisms, either alone or in combination, on immune parameters, infectious outcomes, and inflammatory conditions in humans. Some components of the immune response, including phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity and mucosal immunoglobulin A production (especially in children), can be improved by some probiotic bacteria. Other components, including lymphocyte proliferation, the production of cytokines and of antibodies other than immunoglobulin A appear less sensitive to probiotics. Probiotics, including lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, administered to children can reduce incidence and duration of diarrhoea, but the precise effects depend upon the nature of the condition. Probiotic supplementation can reduce the risk of travellers' diarrhoea in adults, but does not affect duration. The effect of probiotics on other infectious outcomes is less clear. Probiotics may benefit children and adults with irritable bowel syndrome and adults with ulcerative colitis; studies in Crohn's Disease are less clear. Probiotics have little effect in rheumatoid arthritis. Probiotic supplementation, especially with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, can reduce risk and severity of allergic disease, particular atopic dermatitis; early supplementation appears to be effective. Overall, the picture that emerges from studies of probiotics on immune, infectious and inflammatory outcomes in humans is mixed and there appear to be large species and strain differences in effects seen. Other reasons for differences in effects seen will include dose of probiotic organism used, duration of supplementation, characteristics of the subjects studied, sample size, and technical differences in how the measurements were made.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Postprandial symptoms are common in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and could be diet related. We studied postprandial changes in distribution of water in the upper gastrointestinal tract of healthy volunteers (HVs) and patients with IBS-D after contrasting meals. METHODS: In study 1, 11 HVs consumed 350-mL test meals with 5% mannitol (unabsorbable) or 5% glucose (readily absorbed). In study 2, 17 HVs consumed a 331-kcal meal, with or without 15 g bran. In study 3, 26 patients with IBS-D consumed the study 2 diet with bran meal. All subjects underwent serial magnetic resonance imaging analysis. RESULTS: In study 1, subjects' small bowel water content (SBWC) increased after the mannitol but not glucose meals, reaching 381 mL (interquartile range, 343-491 mL) and 47 mL (18-78 mL), respectively, 40 minutes after eating (P < .001). In study 2, SBWC initially decreased after both meal types and then increased, plateauing at 180-405 minutes and was greater after the bran meal (P = .02). In study 3, fasting and postprandial SBWC was lower in IBS-D than in HVs (P < .05 and P < .0001, respectively). Patients with IBS-D had faster orocecal transit times (135 minutes; 90-180 minutes) compared with HVs (225 minutes; 203-293 minutes; P < .0001) and reduced terminal ileum diameter (P < .003). CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial SBWC initially decreases, because of rapid, nutrient-driven fluid absorption, and then increases after a mixed liquid/solid meal. Patients with IBS-D have reduced fasting and postprandial SBWC with faster transit, possibly indicating increased small intestinal tone.},

For meta-analysis, only randomized, blinded controlled trials unrestricted by language were included. Pre-clinical studies, volunteer studies and uncontrolled studies were excluded from the review of efficacy and meta-analysis, but included in the systematic review. Of 31 randomized, placebo-controlled treatment arms in 27 trials (encompassing 5029 study patients), S. boulardii was found to be significantly efficacious and safe in 84% of those treatment arms. A meta-analysis found a significant therapeutic efficacy for S. boulardii in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) (RR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.35-0.63, P < 0.001). In adults, S. boulardii can be strongly recommended for the prevention of AAD and the traveler's diarrhea. Randomized trials also support the use of this yeast probiotic for prevention of enteral nutrition-related diarrhea and reduction of Helicobacter pylori treatment-related symptoms. S. boulardii shows promise for the prevention of C. difficile disease recurrences; treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, acute adult diarrhea, Crohn's disease, giardiasis, human immunodeficiency virus-related diarrhea; but more supporting evidence is recommended for these indications. The use of S. boulardii as a therapeutic probiotic is evidence-based for both efficacy and safety for several types of diarrhea.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of chronic abdominal pain, altered bowel habit and abdominal distension. It is the commonest cause of referral to gastroenterologists in the developed world and yet current therapeutic strategies are often unsatisfactory. There is now increasing evidence linking alterations in the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota and IBS. Changes in faecal and mucosa-associated microbiota, post-infectious IBS, a link with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and an up-regulation of the GI mucosal immune system all suggest a role for the GI microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS. Given this evidence, therapeutic alteration of the GI microbiota by probiotic bacteria could be beneficial. The present paper establishes an aetiological framework for the use of probiotics in IBS and comprehensively reviews randomised placebo-controlled trials of probiotics in IBS using multiple electronic databases. It highlights safety concerns over the use of probiotics and attempts to establish guidelines for their use in IBS in both primary and secondary care.},

For eight weeks, IBS patients consumed 0.4 L per day of a probiotic fermented milk product or non-probiotic acidified milk. Both diets resulted in elevated levels of blood serum L-lactate and 3-hydroxybutyrate. Our results showed identical effects of acidified milk consumption independent of probiotic addition.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Fecal lactoferrin (FL) is a noninvasive biomarker that is elevated in Crohn disease (CD) compared to irritable bowel syndrome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate FL in identifying children with active versus inactive CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fresh stool samples were collected from children with CD scheduled for endoscopy or a clinic visit, and from new outpatients who were scheduled for colonoscopy. FL was determined using a polyclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Physical global assessment, endoscopic findings, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the Pediatric CD Activity Index (PCDAI) were recorded for patients with CD. The PCDAI scores symptoms, laboratory parameters, physical examination, and extraintestinal manifestations. A score of </=10 is inactive disease, 11 to 30 is mild active, and </=31 is moderate to severe active. RESULTS: Of 101 study patients (4- to 20-year-old, 66 boys), 31 had active CD, 23 had inactive CD, and 37 had noninflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) conditions. Four patients with ulcerative colitis and 6 patients with polyposis were excluded from analysis. FL was significantly elevated in CD versus non-IBD (P < 0.001) and in active versus inactive CD (P < 0.001). The PCDAI and ESR were higher in active CD than in inactive CD (both P < 0.001). Using an FL cutoff of 7.25 mug/g, FL has 100% sensitivity and 100% negative predictive value in detecting active CD. Using an FL cutoff level of 60 mug/g, FL had 84% sensitivity, 74% specificity, 81% positive predictive value, and 77% negative predictive value for detecting active CD. CONCLUSIONS: FL is a promising biomarker of active CD and may be more practical to use when it is not feasible to obtain all of the necessary clinical information for the PCDAI.},

   abstract = {Studies of metagenomics and the human microbiome will tremendously expand our knowledge of the composition of microbial communities in the human body. As our understanding of microbial variation and corresponding genetic parameters is refined, this information can be applied to rational remodeling or "tailoring" of human-associated microbial communities and their associated functions. Physiologic features such as the development of innate and adaptive immunity, relative susceptibilities to infections, immune tolerance, bioavailability of nutrients, and intestinal barrier function may be modified by changing the composition and functions of the microbial communities. The specialty of gastroenterology will be affected profoundly by the ability to modify the gastrointestinal microbiota through the rational deployment of antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics. Antibiotics might be used to remove or suppress undesirable components of the human microbiome. Probiotics can introduce missing microbial components with known beneficial functions for the human host. Prebiotics can enhance the proliferation of beneficial microbes or probiotics, to maximize sustainable changes in the human microbiome. Combinations of these approaches might provide synergistic and effective therapies for specific disorders. The human microbiome could be manipulated by such "smart" strategies to prevent and treat acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, and a variety of other disorders.},

   abstract = {The different compartments of the gastrointestinal tract are inhabited by populations of micro-organisms. By far the most important predominant populations are in the colon where a true symbiosis with the host exists that is a key for well-being and health. For such a microbiota, 'normobiosis' characterises a composition of the gut 'ecosystem' in which micro-organisms with potential health benefits predominate in number over potentially harmful ones, in contrast to 'dysbiosis', in which one or a few potentially harmful micro-organisms are dominant, thus creating a disease-prone situation. The present document has been written by a group of both academic and industry experts (in the ILSI Europe Prebiotic Expert Group and Prebiotic Task Force, respectively). It does not aim to propose a new definition of a prebiotic nor to identify which food products are classified as prebiotic but rather to validate and expand the original idea of the prebiotic concept (that can be translated in 'prebiotic effects'), defined as: 'The selective stimulation of growth and/or activity(ies) of one or a limited number of microbial genus(era)/species in the gut microbiota that confer(s) health benefits to the host.' Thanks to the methodological and fundamental research of microbiologists, immense progress has very recently been made in our understanding of the gut microbiota. A large number of human intervention studies have been performed that have demonstrated that dietary consumption of certain food products can result in statistically significant changes in the composition of the gut microbiota in line with the prebiotic concept. Thus the prebiotic effect is now a well-established scientific fact. The more data are accumulating, the more it will be recognised that such changes in the microbiota's composition, especially increase in bifidobacteria, can be regarded as a marker of intestinal health. The review is divided in chapters that cover the major areas of nutrition research where a prebiotic effect has tentatively been investigated for potential health benefits. The prebiotic effect has been shown to associate with modulation of biomarkers and activity(ies) of the immune system. Confirming the studies in adults, it has been demonstrated that, in infant nutrition, the prebiotic effect includes a significant change of gut microbiota composition, especially an increase of faecal concentrations of bifidobacteria. This concomitantly improves stool quality (pH, SCFA, frequency and consistency), reduces the risk of gastroenteritis and infections, improves general well-being and reduces the incidence of allergic symptoms such as atopic eczema. Changes in the gut microbiota composition are classically considered as one of the many factors involved in the pathogenesis of either inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. The use of particular food products with a prebiotic effect has thus been tested in clinical trials with the objective to improve the clinical activity and well-being of patients with such disorders. Promising beneficial effects have been demonstrated in some preliminary studies, including changes in gut microbiota composition (especially increase in bifidobacteria concentration). Often associated with toxic load and/or miscellaneous risk factors, colon cancer is another pathology for which a possible role of gut microbiota composition has been hypothesised. Numerous experimental studies have reported reduction in incidence of tumours and cancers after feeding specific food products with a prebiotic effect. Some of these studies (including one human trial) have also reported that, in such conditions, gut microbiota composition was modified (especially due to increased concentration of bifidobacteria). Dietary intake of particular food products with a prebiotic effect has been shown, especially in adolescents, but also tentatively in postmenopausal women, to increase Ca absorption as well as bone Ca accretion and bone mineral density. Recent data, both from experimental models and from human studies, support the beneficial effects of particular food products with prebiotic properties on energy homaeostasis, satiety regulation and body weight gain. Together, with data in obese animals and patients, these studies support the hypothesis that gut microbiota composition (especially the number of bifidobacteria) may contribute to modulate metabolic processes associated with syndrome X, especially obesity and diabetes type 2. It is plausible, even though not exclusive, that these effects are linked to the microbiota-induced changes and it is feasible to conclude that their mechanisms fit into the prebiotic effect. However, the role of such changes in these health benefits remains to be definitively proven. As a result of the research activity that followed the publication of the prebiotic concept 15 years ago, it has become clear that products that cause a selective modification in the gut microbiota's composition and/or activity(ies) and thus strengthens normobiosis could either induce beneficial physiological effects in the colon and also in extra-intestinal compartments or contribute towards reducing the risk of dysbiosis and associated intestinal and systemic pathologies.},

There was general agreement that probiotic effects were species and often strain specific. The experts agreed that some probiotics were effective in reducing the incidence and duration of rotavirus diarrhoea in infants, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in adults and, for certain probiotics, Clostridium difficile infections. Some probiotics are associated with symptomatic improvements in irritable bowel syndrome and alleviation of digestive discomfort. Probiotics can reduce the frequency and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants and have been shown to regulate intestinal immunity. Several other clinical effects of probiotics, including their role in inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, respiratory or genito-urinary infections or H.pylori adjuvant treatment were thought promising but inconsistent.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: There are no prospective, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized pharmacologic trials for the treatment of pain-predominant functional gastrointestinal disorders in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of amitriptyline in children with pain-predominant functional gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: In this multicenter placebo-controlled trial, children with irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal pain, or functional dyspepsia were randomized to 4 weeks of placebo or amitriptyline (10 mg/d, weight <35 kg; 20 mg/d, weight >35 kg). Assessment of gastrointestinal symptoms, psychological traits, and daily activities occurred before and after intervention. Pain was assessed daily with self-report diaries. The primary outcome was overall response to treatment (child's assessment of pain relief and sense of improvement). Secondary outcomes were effect on psychosocial traits and daily functioning. RESULTS: Ninety children were enrolled, and 83 completed the study (placebo, 40 children [30 girls]; drug, 43 children [35 girls]). A total of 63% of patients reported feeling better and 5% feeling worse in the amitriptyline arm compared with 57.5% feeling better and 2.5% feeling worse in the placebo arm (P = .63). Pain relief was excellent in 7% and good in 38% of children receiving placebo compared with excellent in 15% and good in 35% of children treated with amitriptyline (P = .85). Logistic regression analysis of those reporting excellent or good response versus fair, poor, or failed response showed no difference between amitriptyline and placebo (P = .83). Children who had more severe pain at baseline in both groups (P = .0065) had worse outcome. Amitriptyline reduced anxiety scores (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Both amitriptyline and placebo were associated with excellent therapeutic response. There was no significant difference between amitriptyline and placebo after 4 weeks of treatment. Patients with mild to moderate intensity of pain responded better to treatment.},

The purpose of this review was to determine whether there is evidence-based justification to recommend purchase and promotion of probiotic-containing food in military dining facilities (DFACs). Peer-reviewed literature was searched to identify well-conducted systematic reviews and original research related to the efficacy of probiotics in preventing and/or treating acute infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, respiratory tract infections, allergic rhinitis, dental health issues, and female urogenital conditions. Probiotics may be useful for preventing and/or treating military-relevant health conditions. However, the available scientific evidence is not sufficient to warrant widespread procurement and promotion of probiotic-containing food items in military DFACs. Health care practitioners considering recommending probiotics should understand that health effects and clinical outcomes discussed herein are specific to the probiotic strain, dose, and method of delivery studied in the articles cited.},

Epidemiologic data on adolescence GI disorders are scarce. We aimed to perform a population-based study to assess the prevalence of GI symptoms in adolescents and their relation to sex, age, and socioeconomic status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : A multistage random sample of Tehran middle and high school students (ages 14-19 years) was selected. A validated Persian version of the Rome II questionnaire was used to measure the frequency of different GI disorders as well as demographic socioeconomic variables. RESULTS: : A total of 1436 participants were enrolled in the study, 736 (51.3%) of whom were men. Mean (SD) age was 16.9 (1.8) years. The frequency of at least 1 GI symptom was 32.4%. The 4 most prevalent GI symptoms were bloating (16.9%), heartburn (4.9%), incontinence (4.3%), and irritable bowel syndrome (4.1%). Bloating, irritable bowel syndrome, and proctalgia fugax were significantly more common in girls (P < 0.05). Incontinence was significantly more prevalent in lower socioeconomic status levels (P = 0.01). In logistic regression, age was a risk factor for abdominal bloating and dysphagea and a protective factor for incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: : Our study indicates that GI symptoms are common among adolescents. Girls are more prone to these disorders. Special psychological and medical interventions are necessary for high-risk groups.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Constipation is a frustrating symptom affecting 3% of children worldwide. Randomised controlled trials show that both polyethylene glycol and lactulose are effective in increasing defecation frequency in children with constipation. However, in 30-50%, these children reported abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, diarrhoea, nausea and bad taste of the medication. Two recent studies have shown that the fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis strain DN-173 010 is effective in increasing stool frequency in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients with a defecation frequency < 3/week and in constipated women with a defecation frequency < 3/week. Goal of this study is to determine whether this fermented dairy product is effective in the treatment of constipated children with a defecation frequency < 3/week. METHODS/DESIGN: It is a two nation (The Netherlands and Poland) double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised multicentre trial in which 160 constipated children (age 3-16 years) with a defecation frequency <3/week will be randomly allocated to consume a fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 or a control product, twice a day, for 3 weeks. During the study all children are instructed to try to defecate on the toilet for 5-10 minutes after each meal (3 times a day) and daily complete a standardized bowel diary. Primary endpoint is stool frequency. Secondary endpoints are stool consistency, faecal incontinence frequency, pain during defecation, digestive symptoms (abdominal pain, flatulence), adverse effects (nausea, diarrhoea, bad taste) and intake of rescue medication (Bisacodyl). Rate of success and rate of responders are also evaluated, with success defined as > or = 3 bowel movements per week and < or =1 faecal incontinence episode over the last 2 weeks of product consumption and responder defined as a subject reporting a stool frequency > or = 3 on the last week of product consumption. To demonstrate that the success percentage in the intervention group will be 35% and the success percentage in the control group (acidified milk without ferments, toilet training, bowel diary) will be 15%, with alpha 0.05 and power 80%, a total sample size of 160 patients was calculated. CONCLUSION: This study is aimed to show that the fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis strain DN-173 010 is effective in increasing stool frequency after 3 weeks of product consumption in children with functional constipation and a defecation frequency < 3/week.},

   abstract = {This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and 1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants. Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.},

Although there is evidence that gastrointestinal flora is important in gut motility, there is little evidence that gut flora is abnormal in constipation. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increase stool frequency and decrease consistency in normal individuals. But, according to several reviews, the evidence of probiotics for efficacy in constipation is limited. Fiber supplements, lactose-free diets, and lactobacillus supplementation are effective in the management of children with recurrent abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome. Several studies with Lactobacillus GG in children showed negative results in children with chronic constipation. Because Bifidobacterium animalis DN-173 010 has been shown to be effective in adults with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome this study should also be performed in a well-designed large placebo-controlled trial in children with constipation.},

There is an increased interest in the use of probiotics in the management and treatment of complex medical conditions. Recommendations for probiotic supplementation in the pediatric population are often conflicting due to limited research in many pediatric disease states. Research on single and multistrain probiotics has shown promise for some pediatric populations. This review discusses the research available for probiotic supplementation for children with irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, human immunodeficiency virus, and food allergies. Probiotic safety also is discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recurrent, watery diarrhoea affects one-third of patients diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome ('IBS-D'). Idiopathic bile acid malabsorption ('I-BAM') may be the cause. AIM: To determine the prevalence of I-BAM in patients suffering from IBS-D. METHODS: A systematic search was performed of publications reporting patients presenting with IBS-D type symptoms, who were subsequently confirmed as having I-BAM by SeHCAT scanning. RESULTS: Eighteen relevant studies, 15 prospective, comprising 1223 patients were identified. Five studies (429 patients) indicated that 10% (CI: 7-13) patients had severe bile acid malabsorption (SeHCAT 7 day retention <5% of baseline value). 17 studies (1073 patients) indicated that 32% (CI: 29-35) patients had moderate bile acid malabsorption (SeHCAT <10%). 7 studies (618 patients) indicated that 26% (CI: 23-30) patients had mild (SeHCAT <15%) bile acid malabsorption. Pooled data from 15 studies showed a dose-response relationship according to severity of malabsorption to treatment with a bile acid binder: response to colestyramine occurred in 96% of patients with <5% retention, 80% at <10% retention and 70% at <15% retention. CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic adult-onset bile acid malabsorption is not rare. International guidelines for the management of irritable bowel syndrome need to be revised so that clinicians become more aware of this possibility.},

   abstract = {Media reports on probiotics have been conflicting which has led to increased confusion among the general population and also among health professionals. To disentangle myths and reality, the British Nutrition Foundation has carried out a review on probiotics and health. There is good evidence that probiotics are effective in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and, although only few studies have been carried out so far, probiotic microorganisms also seem to have the potential to prevent the potentially fatal Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea. A limited number of studies that are available on the effectiveness of probiotics on constipation have shown conflicting results, but promising results have been found for certain strains. Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms have been found to be reduced by consuming probiotic strains, although a high placebo effect has been observed in some of the studies. The field of probiotics is relatively new and more studies will be needed to allow firm conclusions on the effectiveness of probiotic microorganisms for certain health issues.},

AIM: To investigate the effect of LAB4, a multistrain probiotic preparation on symptoms of IBS. This probiotic preparation has not previously been assessed in IBS. METHODS: Fifty-two participants with IBS, as defined by the Rome II criteria, participated in this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Participants were randomized to receive either a probiotic preparation comprising two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 (NCIMB 30157) and CUL21 (NCIMB 30156), Bifidobacterium lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172) and Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) at a total of 2.5 x 10(10) cfu/capsule or a placebo for 8 weeks. Participants reported their IBS symptoms using a questionnaire fortnightly during the intervention and at 2 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: A significantly greater improvement in the Symptom Severity Score of IBS and in scores for quality of life, days with pain and satisfaction with bowel habit was observed over the 8-week intervention period in the volunteers receiving the probiotic preparation than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: LAB4 multistrain probiotic supplement may benefit subjects with IBS.},

   abstract = {Melatonin (MT) exerts a beneficial action in the treatment of many diseases, among them also in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Its secretion decreases with age, particularly, in the postmenopausal period in women. It has not been determined whether these changes can have an impact on the clinical picture of IBS. The study aimed at evaluating the urinary excretion of the main MT metabolite - 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate (6-HMS) in women at different age with IBS. The investigations were carried out in five groups of 30 women each. Group Ia (the controls) - premenopausal healthy women (20-39 years), group Ib (the controls) - postmenopausal healthy women (46-66 years), group II - women with constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C; 19-42 years), group III - women with diarrhoea predominant IBS (IBS-D; 20-39 years), group IV - women with IBS-C (49-68 years), group V - women with IBS-D (48-69 years). The diagnosis of IBS was based on the Rome III Criteria after excluding other diseases. On the day of the study the patients remained on the same liquid diet (Nutridrink - 3x400 ml) and 1500 ml of still mineral water. 6-HMS concentration in urine was measured by ELISA method applying IBL antibodies (RE-54031, Immunological Laboratories). The results showed that 24-hour urinary 6-HMS excretion in the studied premenopausal women were as follows: group Ia - 15.13+/-5.83 microg/24 h, group II - 28.85+/-12.59 microg/24 h (p<0,01), group III - 26.10+/-11.76 microg/24 h (p<0,01) and in the postmenopausal subjects they were: group Ib - 10.66+/-3.23 microg/24 h, group IV - 13.73+/-5.09 microg/24 h ((p=0,02), group V - 21.39+/-10.88 microg/24 h (p<0,01). In women with IBS-C the obtained results of 24-hour 6-HMS urinary excretion were independent on the intensity of clinical symptoms. On the other hand, in women with IBS-D, both in the group III and V, higher intensity of ailments was accompanied by significantly increased 6-HMS urinary excretion. The results of the study allowed drawing the following conclusions: (1). 24-hour 6-HMS urinary excretion in women with the constipation-predominant (IBS-C) as well as the diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) is higher than in healthy persons both in the premenopausal and postmenopausal period. (2). Relatively high 6-HMS urinary excretion in postmenopausal women with IBS-D indicates an adaptive increase in MT secretion from EC in the gut.},
