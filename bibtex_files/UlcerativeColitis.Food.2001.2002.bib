   abstract = {The provision of food is thought to promote the maintenance of gut integrity. Nutrients are able to elicit and affect both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Enteral diet therapy has long been known to be efficacious in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in childhood Crohn's disease. However, the mechanisms of action of these diets are not clear. Nutritional repletion, direct effects on the gut mucosa or decreased intestinal permeability have all been postulated as being important in nutritional therapy. There is some evidence that the enteral diet has a direct effect on the gut mucosa by reducing cytokine production and the accompanying inflammation, thus leading to decreased intestinal permeability. Modifications of enteral diet composition have been evaluated in many studies. Such modifications include fat and/or protein content and the addition of bioactive peptides. The fatty acid composition of the enteral diet seems to have a much greater impact on its efficacy than modification of the N source. As specific fatty acids are precursors of inflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid, the reduction in these components may be beneficial in nutritional therapy for IBD. Addition of bioactive peptides to enteral diet formulas may also have a role; such peptides may have specific growth factor or anti-inflammatory actions. There is still much work to be done to define disease-specific enteral diet formulas that are effective as therapies for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF), a type of dietary fiber, exhibits therapeutic effects in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. However, the precise mechanisms responsible for these effects are still under investigation. On the other hand, it has been suggested that bile salts in the gut lumen play an important role in the integrity of the intestinal mucosa. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of GBF to adsorb bile salts in vitro. METHODS: The binding capacities of GBF, enzymatically digested GBF (GBF-fiber), and alpha-cellulose for unconjugated and conjugated bile salts were measured using Langmuir's method. The morphology of these fibers was observed by light and fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: GBF adsorbed bile salts very strongly, especially hydrophobic bile salts. Even after enzymatic digestion, the GBF fiber still exhibited strong binding capacity, whereas alpha-cellulose exhibited very low binding capacity. Microscopically, GBF consists mainly of aleurone, a lattice-like cell wall with cytoplasm enclosed. After enzymatic digestion, the cytoplasm was also digested. CONCLUSION: GBF possesses a great capacity to adsorb bile salts. This may be part of the mechanism for the therapeutic effects of GBF in UC patients.},

   abstract = {We studied the molecular events underlying butyrate-induced apoptosis in two different colon cancer cell lines: Caco-2, a well defined cancer cell and RSB, a cell line obtained from a colonic tumor of an ulcerative colitis patient. Caco-2 and RSB cells were exposed to 2, 5 and 10 mmol/L butyrate for 48 h. Caspase-1 was cleaved in Caco-2-cells at all butyrate concentrations, whereas in RSB-cells caspase-1 expression was undetectable. In RSB cells, butyrate dose-dependently induced caspase-3 cleavage, whereas in Caco-2-cells, butyrate up-regulated expression of the caspase-3 active subunit. Caspase-3-specific activity, cytoplasmic nucleosome concentration and growth were directly correlated with butyrate doses in both cell lines; however, the response was more pronounced in Caco-2 than in RSB cells. Expression of the cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) product was elevated in both cell lines at the highest butyrate concentration. Bak expression gradually increased as a function of butyrate concentrations in both cell lines. At 10 mmol/L butyrate, expression increased by fivefold and sevenfold in Caco-2 and RSB cells, respectively. The highest expression of Bcl-2 was observed in control Caco-2 cells, and expression decreased with increasing butyrate concentration. This effect was not observed in RSB cells. Inactivation of caspase-1 with Z-YVAD-FMK abrogated butyrate-induced apoptosis in Caco-2 but not in RSB cells. Inactivation of caspase-3 with Z-DVED-FMK completely inhibited butyrate-induced apoptosis in RSB cells whereas this effect was less pronounced in Caco-2 cells. Our data demonstrate that butyrate-induced apoptosis is activated via different apoptotic pathways in diversely stratified colon cancers.},

   abstract = {A germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) containing glutamine-rich protein and hemicellulose-rich fiber was made from brewer's spent grain, by physical isolation. Our previous studies demonstrated that GBF supported maintenance of epithelial cell populations, facilitated epithelial repair, and suppressed epithelial nuclear factor kappaB-DNA-binding activity through generating increased short-chain fatty acid (especially butyrate) production by luminal microflora, which includes Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium, thereby preventing experimental colonic injury. The fiber fraction also modulates stool water content because of its high water-holding capacity. The patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis who had been unresponsive to or intolerant of standard treatment received 20-30 g GBF, feeding daily in a non-randomized, open-label fashion. At 4 weeks, this treatment resulted in a significant clinical and endoscopic improvement. The improvement was associated with an increase in stool butyrate concentrations. These results indicate that GBF feeding is a potentially new, attractive prebiotic treatment in patients with ulcerative colitis. The potency of GBF on modulating microflora, as well as the high water-holding capacity, may play an important role in treatment and prolongation of remission in ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Differential diagnosis between ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) is difficult in the initial phases in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). This study was performed to determine the significance of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) in IBD. ANCA were specified with regard to their antigenic specifity, significance to the diagnosis, and correlation of titer with the disease activity. The occurrence of food allergy was questioned, too. Serum samples from 44 children with UC (n = 23) or CD (n = 21) and from disease-control children (coeliac disease, n = 21) were analyzed for IgG ANCA, ANCA target antigens, IgA and IgG ASCA, and IgE to food allergens. Results show that ANCA occur more frequently in UC than in CD and disease-control (74, 24, and 10%, respectively). The presence of ANCA does not reflect disease activity. Antigenic specificity does not differ in any group. IgA-ASCA are found more often in patients with CD (76% versus 17% in UC). The testing for both ANCA and ASCA enabled clear-cut differential diagnosis between UC and CD based on the high specificity (ANCA+ ASCA- 92.5% for UC, ANCA- ASCA+ 93.2% for CD). Specific IgE to food allergens were found in 8.7, 14.3, and 23.8% of patients with UC, CD, and coeliac disease, respectively. We conclude that combined testing of ANCA and ASCA represents a valuable tool in the differential diagnosis between UC and CD in pediatric patients, minimizing invasive diagnostic procedures. Monitoring of ANCA, its specificity, and titer determination does not bring more information. Testing for specific IgE to food allergens may be considered in individual patients.},

   abstract = {The aim of the present paper is to briefly review the literature relating to clinical studies of the use of polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The reasons for the discrepancies in the findings could be related to the different study designs, different treatments, overlapping of treatment effects, as well as the variety of treatment formulations and doses used, which have led to results that are, in certain instances, very difficult to explain. Emphasis on a treatment formulation which reduces the incidence of side effects, together with careful selection of patients and experimental design, seems to be associated with benefits, and these studies point to the therapeutic potential for these lipids in the therapy of IBD. It is possible that these fatty acids act by reducing low-grade active inflammation rather than by preventing reinitiation of the inflammatory process from a truly quiescent state. Whether this treatment is applicable to all IBD patients has not been fully elucidated. Nevertheless, taken together, all these studies suggest the effectiveness of these new therapeutic approaches, not only when conventional treatment fails or when it is not possible to treat chronically, but also, in some instances, as first choice.},

Cells remained viable and metabolically active as shown by the increase in L(+) lactic acid in HIE+VSL#3 and HIE+yog and the pH decreased (approx. 5.5 compared with the 6.2 of control HIE). Total SCFA Short Chain Fatty Acids decreased in HIE+yog and HIE+VSL#3 at 6h and in all cultures at 24h; butyric acid decreased in HIE+Bif and HIE+VSL#3. Generally in vivo the bacteria remain in the ileo-caecal tract no longer than six h, therefore VSL#3 bacteria seem able to pass this barrier viably, colonizing the large bowel.},

   abstract = {Recent observations demonstrate that enteropathogenetic and enterohaemorrhagic bacteria, as well as other non enteropathogenetic bacteria (Listeria, Coxiella Burnetii), may subvert the host cell cytoskeleton. Models from enteropathogenic bacteria demonstrate that cytoskeletal proteins are required for bacteria binding to the enterocytes and that they play a role in the immune response of the host to intestinal bacteria. The cytoskeletal protein family Tropomyosins is present in all eukaryotic cells, with multiple isoforms regulated by multiple genes. Of the different Tropomyosin isoforms, TM5 has been shown to be expressed in colonic and jejunal epithelial cells, while TM1 in colonic and jejunal smooth muscle. In vitro studies have shown the presence of serum and mucosal IgG against TM5 in almost two thirds of patients with ulcerative colitis, suggesting: a. a possible autoimmune response to Tropomyosin in these patients; b. the hypothesis that the development of pouchitis may be related to the expression of TM5 in the ileal pouch; c. the use of probiotics in the treatment of pouchitis. Overall, the new expression of cytoskeletal proteins on the cell surface appears to be possibly induced by several mechanisms, including intestinal bacteria and apoptosis. The expression of cytoskeletal proteins on the cell surface may induce tolerance or autoimmune response on target cells. Further investigations are, however needed on the possible role of cytoskeletal proteins in human diseases.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two idiopathic inflammatory disorders of the GI tract. Manifestations of disease can be severe and lead to long term therapy with a variety of medications and/or surgery. Standard medical therapy consists of agents that either treat suppurative complications or modulate the inflammatory cascade in a nonspecific manner. Many specific chemokine and cytokine effectors that promote intestinal inflammation have been identified. Such work has led to experimental clinical trials with a variety of cytokine antagonists. Compounds directed against one such cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), have demonstrated the greatest clinical efficacy to date. This is consistent with scientific observations that suggest a central role for TNF in the inflammatory cascade. Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF that has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of Crohn's disease. Infliximab is Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of Crohn's disease. There exist several other TNF antagonists in various phases of investigation, including the monoclonal antibody CDP 571, the fusion peptide etanercept, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor oxpentifylline, and thalidomide. The clinical efficacy of these agents and the role of TNF in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is reviewed.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is a major source of extrapineal melatonin. In some animals, tissue concentrations of melatonin in the GIT surpass blood levels by 10-100 times and the digestive tract contributes significantly to melatonin concentrations in the peripheral blood, particularly during the day. Some melatonin found in the GIT may originate from the pineal gland, as the organs of the digestive system contain binding sites, which in some species exhibit circadian variation. Unlike the production of pineal melatonin, which is under the photoperiodic control, release of GI melatonin seems to be related to periodicity of food intake. Melatonin and melatonin binding sites were localized in all GI tissues of mammalian and avian embryos. Postnatally, melatonin was localized in the GIT of newborn mice and rats. Phylogenetically, melatonin and melatonin binding sites were detected in GIT of numerous mammals, birds and lower vertebrates. Melatonin is probably produced in the serotonin-rich enterochromaffin cells (EC) of the GI mucosa and can be released into the portal vein postprandially. In addition, melatonin can act as an autocrine or a paracrine hormone affecting the function of GI epithelium, lymphatic tissues of the immune system and the smooth muscles of the digestive tube. Finally, melatonin may act as a luminal hormone, synchronizing the sequential digestive processes. Higher peripheral and tissue levels of melatonin were observed not only after food intake but also after a long-term food deprivation. Such melatonin release may have a direct effect on the various GI tissues but may also act indirectly via the CNS; such action might be mediated by sympathetic or parasympathetic nerves. Melatonin can protect GI mucosa from ulceration by its antioxidant action, stimulation of the immune system and by fostering microcirculation and epithelial regeneration. Melatonin may reduce the secretion of pepsin and the hydrochloric acid and influence the activity of the myoelectric complexes of the gut via its action in the CNS. Tissue or blood levels of melatonin may serve as a marker of GI lesions or tumors. Clinically, melatonin has a potential for a prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, children colic and diarrhea.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract of vertebrate species is a rich source of extrapineal melatonin. The concentration of melatonin in the gastrointestinal tissues surpasses blood levels by 10-100 times and there is at least 400x more melatonin in the gastrointestinal tract than in the pineal gland. The gastrointestinal tract contributes significantly to circulating concentrations of melatonin, especially during the daytime and melatonin may serve as an endocrine, paracrine, or autocrine hormone influencing the regeneration and function of epithelium, enhancing the immune system of the gut, and reducing the tone of gastrointestinal muscles. As binding sites for melatonin exhibit circadian variation in various species, it has been hypothesized that some melatonin found in the gastrointestinal tract might be of pineal origin. Unlike the photoperiodically regulated production of melatonin in the pineal, the release of gastrointestinal melatonin seems to be related to the periodicity of food intake.

Melatonin was found also in large quantities in the embryonic tissue of the mammalian and avian gastrointestinal tract. Food intake and, paradoxically, also longterm food deprivation resulted in an increase of tissue and plasma concentrations of melatonin. Melatonin release may have a direct effect on many gastrointestinal tissues but may also well influence the digestive tract indirectly, via the central nervous system and the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Melatonin prevents ulcerations of gastrointestinal mucosa by an antioxidant action, reduction of secretion of hydrochloric acid, stimulation of the immune system, fostering epithelial regeneration, and increasing microcirculation. Because of its unique properties, melatonin could be considered for prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, gastric ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, and childhood colic.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Iron supplementation may increase disease activity in ulcerative colitis, possibly through the production of reactive oxygen species from the Fenton reaction. AIM: To assess the effects of two doses of oral iron on intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress in experimental colitis. METHODS: Colitis was induced in rats by giving 5% dextran sulphate sodium in drinking water for 7 days. First, using a 2 x 2 factorial design, rats with or without dextran sulphate sodium received the regular diet or a diet containing iron 3%/kg diet. Second, rats with dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis were supplemented with iron 0.3%/kg diet and compared with rats on dextran sulphate sodium and regular diet. The body weight change, histological scores, colon length, rectal bleeding, plasma and colonic lipid peroxides, colonic glutathione peroxidase and plasma vitamin E and C were measured. Faecal analysis for haem and total, free and ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid-chelatable iron was also performed. RESULTS: Iron 3% and iron 0.3% increased the activity of dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis, as demonstrated by higher histological scores, heavier rectal bleeding and further shortening of the colon. This was associated with increased lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant vitamins. Faecal iron available to the Fenton reaction was increased in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Iron supplementation taken orally enhanced the activity of dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis and is associated with an increase in oxidative stress.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The occupational distribution of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may help to shed light on its yet unknown etiology. The U.S. vital statistics offer the opportunity to study cause of death by occupation and industry. METHODS: The numbers of deaths from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were retrieved from the computerized 1991-1996 data files of the National Center for Health Statistics. Deaths were grouped by gender, ethnicity, disease type, occupation, and industry. Mortality by occupation and industry were expressed as proportional mortality ratio (PMR), adjusted for gender and ethnicity. RESULTS: Between 1991 and 1996, 2399 subjects died from Crohn's disease and 2419 subjects died from ulcerative colitis. Significant correlations were found between the PMR values of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease regarding their distribution by occupation, r = 0.36 and p < 0.05, as well as by industry, r = 0.37, p < 0.01. IBD mortality by occupation was significantly reduced among farmers (PMR: 70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 42-97), mining machine operators (31, 95% CI: 0-74), and laborers (71. 95% CI: 45-98). A nonsignificant increase was found among sales persons (117, 95% CI: 95-139) and secretaries (122, 95% CI: 83-161). IBD mortality by industry was significantly reduced in agricultural production of livestock (39, 95% CI: 1-78), mining (46, 95% CI: 9-83), grocery stores (55, 95% CI: 17-94), and work in private households (64, 95% CI: 30-97). A nonsignificant increase was found in food production (128, 95% CI: 74-182), investment and insurance business (137, 95% CI: 77-198), and administration (122, 95% CI: 81-163). CONCLUSIONS: IBD mortality is low in occupations associated with manual work and farming and relatively high in sedentary occupations associated with indoor work. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis show a similar distribution.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related intestinal damage. Circulating antioxidants may have a role to play in preventing free radical-mediated tissue injury. METHODS: Plasma vitamin A, E and carotenoid concentrations, leukocytic genomic damage and 8-hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG) concentration were determined in 46 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, 37 Crohn disease (CD) patients and 386 controls. A 20 ml blood sample was taken from each subject for antioxidant and 8-OHdG measurements. A food frequency questionnaire was administered to a sample of subjects from each group to evaluate daily intake of dietary compounds. RESULTS: Antioxidant concentration was significantly reduced in IBD patients, particularly in those with active disease, with respect to controls (P < 0.0001). 8-OHdG concentrations were significantly increased in IBD patients compared to controls, independent of disease activity (P < 0.05). No correlation was found between antioxidant and 8-OHdG concentrations. Carotenoid concentrations were significantly reduced in malnourished IBD patients (0.89 +/- 0.14 micromol/l) compared to patients with normal or high body mass index (1.83 +/- 0.12 micromol/l; P < 0.05), independent of disease activity or extension. Protein, fruit and vegetable intakes of IBD patients were significantly lower than those of controls. CONCLUSIONS: Depletion of antioxidants is likely to be important in the pathophysiology of IBD: UC and CD patients show increased free radical peripheral leukocyte DNA damage and decreased plasma antioxidant defenses. These results indicate the necessity of further studies to establish whether optimal vitamin status may improve the clinical course of UC and CD.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is a complex ecosystem host to a diverse and highly evolved microbial community composed of hundreds of different microbial species. The interactions that occur between this complex microbial community and the human host have become the focus of scientific research due to increases in the incidence of illnesses associated with deficient or compromised microflora (e.g., gastrointestinal tract infections, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome, antibiotic-induced diarrhea, constipation, food allergies, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers). Effective multidisciplinary research programs now complement conventional microbiology with molecular ecology techniques to provide culture-independent analysis of the gastrointestinal ecosystem. Furthermore, as we acquire an understanding of gut microflora composition and processes such as intestinal adherence, colonization, translocation, and immunomodulation, we are also elucidating mechanisms by which these can be influenced. This knowledge not only allows scientists to define the activities and interactions of "functional food"-borne beneficial bacteria in the gut, but will also provide the scientific basis for the development of innovative biotechnology-based products tailored to prevent specific diseases and promote overall human gastrointestinal health.},

   abstract = {The enteric flora comprises approximately 95% of the total number of cells in the human body and can elicit immune responses while protecting against microbial pathogens. However, the resident bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease). The objectives of the Probiotic Research Group based at University College Cork were to isolate and identify lactic acid bacteria exhibiting beneficial probiotic traits, such as bile tolerance in the absence of deconjugation activity, acid resistance, adherence to host epithelial tissue, and in vitro antagonism of pathogenic microorganisms or those suspected of promoting inflammation. To isolate potentially effective probiotic bacteria, we screened the microbial population adhering to surgically resected segments of the gastrointestinal tract (the environment in which they may subsequently be reintroduced and required to function). In total, 1500 bacterial strains from resected human terminal ilea were assessed. From among these organisms, Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius strain UCC118 was selected for further study. In mouse feeding trials, milk-borne L. salivarius strain UCC118 could successfully colonize the murine gastrointestinal tract. A human feeding study conducted in 80 healthy volunteers showed that yogurt can be used as a vehicle for delivery of strain UCC118 to the human gastrointestinal tract with considerable efficacy in influencing gut flora and colonization. In summary, we developed criteria for in vitro selection of probiotic bacteria that may reflect certain in vivo effects on the host such as modulation of gastrointestinal tract microflora.},

   abstract = {Smoking has a dichotomous effect on inflammatory bowel disease, ameliorating disease activity in ulcerative colitis but having a deleterious effect on Crohn's disease. This effect is thought to be due to nicotine. We investigated the effect of chronic nicotine administration on the small and large bowel in iodoacetamide-induced jejunitis and colitis. Jejunitis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by intrajejunal administration of 0.1 ml 2% iodoacetamide and colitis by intrarectal administration of 0.1 ml 3% iodoacetamide. Nicotine was dissolved in drinking water (12.5 or 250 micrograms/ml), rats drinking ad libitum. Nicotine administration started 10 days prior to damage induction and throughout the experiment and had no effect on weight gain or daily food intake of rats. Rats were killed 5 days after iodoacetamide-induced colitis and 7 days after induction of jejunitis. The jejunum and colon were resected, rinsed, weighed, damage assessed macroscopically and microscopically and tissue processed for myeloperoxidase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) generation. Effects of nicotine on gut microcirculation were also assessed. Nicotine by itself caused no damage to the colon. Nicotine had a dichotomous effect on jejunitis and colitis. At a dose of 12.5 micrograms/ml nicotine improved the macroscopic damage of colitis from 252 +/- 66 to 70 +/- 31 mm2, and segmental weight also declined significantly in the colon (from 1.7 +/- 0.2 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 g/10 cm). In contrast, the same dose of nicotine had a deleterious effect on iodoacetamide-induced jejunitis, increasing the macroscopic damage from 368 +/- 38 to 460 +/- 97 mm2 in rats treated with injury escalating to 970 +/- 147 in rats treated with 250 micrograms/ml nicotine. Nicotine treatment also significantly increased jejunal segmental weight. By itself nicotine did not change NOS activity or PGE2 generation compared to control rats, but it enhanced microcirculation in the colon, whereas in the jejunum nicotine decreased PGE2 generation and increased NOS activity but not jejunal microcirculation. Nicotine has opposite effects on iodoacetamide-induced colitis and jejunitis, which may be partly explained by decreased PGE2 generation and increased NOS activity in the jejunum and an increase in the colonic microcirculation.},

Several theories regarding the etiology of Crohn's disease have been proposed, one of which is infection with Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis), which causes a similar disease in animals, and is present in the human food chain. Considerable evidence supports the presence of M. paratuberculosis in the intestinal tissues of many patients with Crohn's disease including culture, detection of homologous mycobacterial DNA, detection of the mycobacterial insertion sequence IS900 by both PCR and in situ hybridization in tissues, and a serologic immune response to recombinant M. paratuberculosis antigens. Despite this evidence, and our personal belief that M. paratuberculosis is a cause of Crohn's disease, widespread acceptance of this hypothesis will require evidence that specific anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy will cure the disease.},

   abstract = {An Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain isolated from a patient with hemorrhagic colitis was found to exhibit two slightly different colony morphology types on differential medium. Each morphological type, designated TT12A and TT12B, was isolated, and serological testing using various assays confirmed that both strains carried the O157 and the H7 antigens. Biochemical testing showed that the strains had identical profiles on AP120E analysis and, like typical O157:H7 strains, did not ferment sorbitol or exhibit beta-glucuronidase activity. Analysis with a multiplex PCR assay showed that TT12B did not carry the gene for either Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) or Stx2, whereas these genes were present in TT12A and the toxins were produced. Apart from that, both strains carried the +93 gusA mutation, the cluster I ehxA gene for enterohemolysin, and the eae gene for gamma-intimin, which are all characteristics of the O157:H7 serotype. Phenotypic assays confirmed that both strains exhibited enterohemolysin activity and the attachment and effacing lesion on HeLa cells. Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis analysis showed that the strains are closely related genetically and belong in the same clonal group. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing of XbaI-digested genomic DNA revealed that the two strains differed by two bands but shared 90% similarity and clustered in the same clade. All other non-Stx-producing O157:H7 strains examined clustered in a major clade that was distinct from that of Stx-producing O157:H7 strains. The findings that TT12B was identical to TT12A, except for Stx production, and its PFGE profile is also more closely related to that of Stx-producing O157:H7 strains suggest that TT12B was derived from TT12A by the loss of both stx genes.},

   abstract = {Probiotic ingestion can be recommended as a preventative approach to maintaining the balance of the intestinal microflora and thereby enhance 'well-being'. Research into the use of probiotic intervention in specific illnesses and disorders has identified certain patient populations that may benefit from the approach. Undoubtedly, probiotics will vary in their efficacy and it may not be the case that the same results occur with all species. Those that prove most efficient will likely be strains that are robust enough to survive the harsh physico-chemical conditions present in the gastrointestinal tract. This includes gastric acid, bile secretions and competition with the resident microflora. A survey of the literature indicates positive results in over fifty human trials, with prevention/treatment of infections the most frequently reported output. In theory, increased levels of probiotics may induce a 'barrier' influence against common pathogens. Mechanisms of effect are likely to include the excretion of acids (lactate, acetate), competition for nutrients and gut receptor sites, immunomodulation and the formation of specific antimicrobial agents. As such, persons susceptible to diarrhoeal infections may benefit greatly from probiotic intake. On a more chronic basis, it has been suggested that some probiotics can help maintain remission in the inflammatory conditions, ulcerative colitis and pouchitis. They have also been suggested to repress enzymes responsible for genotoxin formation. Moreover, studies have suggested that probiotics are as effective as anti-spasmodic drugs in the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome. The approach of modulating the gut flora for improved health has much relevance for the management of those with acute and chronic gut disorders. Other target groups could include those susceptible to nosocomial infections, as well as the elderly, who have an altered microflora, with a decreased number of beneficial microbial species. For the future, it is imperative that mechanistic interactions involved in probiotic supplementation be identified. Moreover, the survival issues associated with their establishment in the competitive gut ecosystem should be addressed. Here, the use of prebiotics in association with useful probiotics may be a worthwhile approach. A prebiotic is a dietary carbohydrate selectively metabolised by probiotics. Combinations of probiotics and prebiotics are known as synbiotics.},

   abstract = {There is increasing evidence that intestinal microflora play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. Therefore, modification of the microflora by prebiotics, probiotics, and antibiotics may be a rational approach for controlling intestinal inflammation. Germinated barley food-stuff (GBF) is an insoluble mixture of glutamine-rich protein and hemicellulose-rich dietary fiber. GBF is utilized efficiently by Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium and converted by them into lactate, acetate, and butyrate. These bacterial organic acids preserve a favorable intestinal condition. We have previously shown that GBF has attenuated intestinal inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis and experimental colitis models through prebiotic actions. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of GBF with that of probiotics and antibiotics in an experimental colitis model. Colitis was induced by feeding male SD rats with a diet containing 3.0-3.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). The therapeutic effect of oral administration of a prebiotic (GBF), probiotics (mixture of Lactobacillus and Clostridium butyricum), antibiotics (vancomycin, metronidazole), and the vehicle was determined by assessing clinical and pathological scores on day 6 after initiation of colitis. Butyrate concentrations in the cecal content were also determined. GBF treatment significantly reduced colonic inflammation as assessed by clinical scores with an increase in cecal butyrate levels. Probiotic treatment with a mixture of Lactobacillus and Clostridium butyricum did not show such an effect. Both antibiotic treatments significantly attenuated clinical and pathological scores. However, in contrast to GBF, this treatment led to a significant decrease in cecal butyrate levels. These data suggest that modification of the intestinal microflora by prebiotics, including GBF, may serve as a useful adjunct in the treatment of ulcerative colitis as well as antibiotic treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases of unknown etiology. Unspecific immunosuppressive therapy represents current standard treatment and is often associated with severe side effects. Several treatment regimens have been evaluated to identify alternative therapeutic options. Among these different diet therapies were investigated. Objective of this paper is to review the results of diet therapy in chronic inflammatory bowel disease on the basis of randomised controlled trials and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: Medline and Cochrane Library were searched for meta-analysis and randomised controlled trials investigating this question. Additionally reference lists of identified articles and text books were checked for further trials. RESULTS: Four meta-analyses investigated the treatment of acute Crohn's disease with elemental-, semi-elemental-, and polymeric diets in comparison to corticosteroids or to another form of enteral diet. All meta-analyses show a superiority of corticosteroids and no difference in the effect of the compared enteral diets. Randomised controlled trials investigating diet therapy in ulcerative colitis have not been summarised in a meta-analysis yet. Eleven randomised trials were identified which evaluated diets in ulcerative colitis patients: Dietary supplementation with n-3-fatty acids (6 trials), elemental diet [2], dietary supplementation with dietary fiber [1], elimination diet [1], and dietary supplementation with olestra [1]. Only for the elimination diet a significant positive effect on the course of disease was found in one trial which investigated only 18 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutritional therapy of acute Crohn's disease is less effective than treatment with corticosteroids. In case of severe steroid induced side effects diet treatment can present a promising alternative. Superiority of one of the investigated different formulations was not found. Meta-analyses of randomised trials provide a clear and easy to understand presentation of the effect of this intervention. Eleven published trials investigating the effect of diets in ulcerative colitis show only for elimination diet a positive treatment effect. The trials do find a positive effect of one of the other interventions but the trials are very small and cannot exclude a treatment effect. Meta-analysis of these trials would be helpful for a better presentation and understanding of these results.},

In the past year significant work has been published examining the mechanisms of impaired food intake in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, which allow a better understanding of these processes. Data from the same laboratory have shed further light on the relative role of underfeeding and inflammation on the growth retardation associated with intestinal inflammation. Other studies have provided further data on the risk factors and predictive biomarkers of bone loss in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The potential role of enteral nutrition as primary therapy for Crohn's disease is particularly addressed in this review. Recent contributions to the field emphasized the special importance of this modality of therapy in paediatric patients. The possible mechanisms for such a therapeutic action are not well understood. Other nutrients may have a therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease. In particular, recent data on the in-vivo anti-inflammatory actions of butyrate merit special mention. Finally, novel nutritional therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease, such as transforming growth factor-beta2-enriched enteral feeding, or hydrothermally processed cereals have recently been explored.},

By December 2000, it had completed phase II trials for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) [393219]. In March 2001, the FDA designated CBP-1011 an Orphan Drug for the treatment of thrombocytopenic pupura [400935]. In June 2000, InKine reported that a US patent (subsequently identified as US-06068983, entitled 'Methods of stimulating phagocytosis' and assigned to University of Pennsylvania) had been issued to Alan D Schreiber MD, Chairman of InKine's Scientific Advisory Board. The patent describes methods of increasing Fc receptors on white blood cells or macrophages, as well as inducing Fc receptors in cells that do not normally possess them, such as lung and liver cells [370990]. In April 2001, the University of Pennsylvania (inventor again Alan D Schreiber) claimed the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate for treating IBD, CD, UC, food allergies, hemorrhoids and psoriasis in WO-00122959, entitled 'Method of treating inflammatory conditions with progesterone or progesterone analogs'.},

In contrast, nutrition plays no major role in the development of the disease or in provoking an acute attack.

The remission rate of this side effect-free therapy is, however, lower than that seen with steroids. The data available for diet therapy in ulcerative colitis are less unequivocal, but the effects are probably slight at best. During the remission phase, the patient should eat a balanced, vitamin-rich and varied normal diet that excludes all poorly tolerated foods: lactose intolerance in particular appears to be increased in patients with Crohn's disease. Known vitamin or mineral deficiencies should be corrected by appropriate dietary measures or supplementation. There is no such thing as a "Crohn's diet" or "colitis diet". The patient can be allowed to eat anything that is tolerated.},

   abstract = {The primary function of the gastrointestinal system is to assist the intake and further processing of food and liquids. Besides that, it forms an anatomical barrier between the external environment and internal milieu. It is also highly important for its paracrine and endocrine function. Inflammatory bowel diseases, which frequently cause a gastrointestinal failure, form a specific group. Most frequently it is the ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Impaired integrity of the gastrointestinal mucosa and failure of protective mechanisms lead to the increased permeability of the intestinal wall for antigens derived from food, saprophytic bacteria and pathogenic microorganisms. When the gastrointestinal failure is threatening, factors determining its residual function become more important. As decisive reveals the severity and location of the primary disease. Previous surgeries and adaptation of the residual part of the gastrointestinal system are important, as well as the possibility of peroral or enteral nutrient intake. Depending on the presence of risk factors and the degree of residual gut function, some complications can be expected: dehydration, mineral disorders, symptoms of protein and energy depletion, infection, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. It is highly important to decide whether the gastrointestinal system will be included into or excluded from the process of realimentation. Critically ill patients with inflammatory bowel diseases should be treated at an intensive care unit.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) contains protein and insoluble dietary fiber. We have previously shown in ulcerative colitis patients and a colitis model that GBF feeding attenuates mucosal damage by increasing luminal butyrate levels. However, the detailed mechanism remains unclear because of its heterogeneous nature. The present study was carried out to: (i) evaluate the active ingredient in GBF; and (ii) examine its effect on the repair process in colonic inflammation by using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis model. METHODS: Colitis was induced by feeding a diet containing 0.5-3.5% DSS to male Sprague-Dawley rats. (i) Active ingredient: GBF was fractionated enzymatically into fiber- and protein-rich fractions. Each fraction was administered to DSS-colitis rats. Clinical signs, cecal short chain fatty acid concentrations and serum alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) levels were determined. (ii) Effect on mucosal repair: GBF with or without salazosulfapyridine (SASP), or SASP alone was administered to rats after the onset of colitis. Seven days after initial treatment, the number of epithelial cells in HE sections was evaluated morphologically in a blind fashion and serum AAG was determined. RESULTS: (i) Germinate barley foodstuff and GBF-fiber significantly attenuated the clinical signs of colitis and decreased serum AAG levels, with a significant increase in cecal butyrate production, while GBF-protein did not. (ii) Treatment with GBF alone and GBF plus SASP significantly accelerated colonic epithelial repair and improved clinical signs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the fiber fraction of GBF may effectively enhance luminal butyrate production, and thereby accelerate colonic epithelial repair in colitis.},

   abstract = {A germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) contained glutamine-rich protein and the hemicellulose-rich fiber was made from brewer's spent grain by physical isolation (milling and sieving). Both in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that the fiber fraction of GBF supports maintenance of epithelial cell populations, facilitates epithelial repair, and suppresses epithelial nuclear factor kappa B-DNA binding activity through generating increased short-chain fatty acid (especially butyrate) production by luminal microflora which includes Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium, thereby preventing experimental colonic injury. The fiber fraction also modulates stool water content by its high water-holding capacity. The protein fraction which contains larger glutamine prevents experimental small bowel injury. Based on these observations, clinical studies were initiated in patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis. The patients who had been unresponsive to or intolerant of standard treatment received 30 grams of GBF feeding daily in a nonrandomized, open-label fashion. At 4 weeks, this treatment resulted in a significant clinical and endoscopic improvement independent of disease extent. The improvement was associated with an increase in stool butyrate concentrations and in luminal Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium levels. After the end of GBF treatment the patients had an exacerbation of the disease. GBF was safe and well tolerated. These results indicate that GBF feeding is a potentially attractive treatment in patients with ulcerative colitis.},

Since GBF contains a poorly digested protein fraction, this protein may be transferred to and absorbed in the colon. It may therefore be possible to detect the GBF antigen in colitis patients with dysfunctional colonic mucosal barrier defense. In this study, the antigenic potency of GBF was examined in vivo and in vitro. Using the AOAC method, the indigestible fraction of GBF (dietary fiber) was obtained, and the poorly digested protein fraction in GBF was determined. Using Sprague Dawley rats with chronic colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 2.5% in diet), a GBF and control diet were administered, and total and specific serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) against intestinal contents and the soluble GBF protein were determined. In addition, reactivity between serum and intestinal content were examined by gel electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA). GBF showed relatively low protein digestibility (47%) because of its low solubility in neutral pH. Total serum IgE in both dietary groups was not significantly different, and specific IgE antibodies against intestinal contents and the soluble GBF protein were not significantly different. In addition, supershifts were not observed in either dietary group by EMSA. The possible antigenicity of oral GBF was considered to be low in this colitis model.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) is a prebiotic foodstuff that effectively increases luminal butyrate production by stimulating the growth of protective bacteria. In the first pilot study, GBF has been shown to reduce both clinical activity and mucosal inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of GBF in the treatment of UC in a multicenter open control trial. METHODS: Eighteen patients with mildly to moderately active UC were divided into two groups using a random allocation protocol. The control group (n = 7) were given a baseline anti-inflammatory therapy for 4 weeks. In the GBF-treated group (n = 11), patients received 20-30 g GBF daily, together with the baseline treatment, for 4 weeks. The response to the treatments was evaluated clinically and endoscopically. Fecal microflora were also analyzed. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of observation, the GBF-treated group showed a significant decrease in clinical activity index scores compared with the control group (P < 0.05). No side effects related to GBF were observed. GBF therapy increased fecal concentrations of Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium limosum. CONCLUSIONS: Oral GBF therapy may have the potency to reduce clinical activity of UC. We believe that these results support the use of GBF administration as a new adjunct therapy for UC.},

   abstract = {Colonic bacteria produce hydrogen sulfide, a toxic compound postulated to play a pathogenetic role in ulcerative colitis. Colonic sulfide exposure has previously been assessed via measurements of fecal sulfide concentration. However, we found that <1% of fecal sulfide of rats was free, the remainder being bound in soluble and insoluble complexes. Thus fecal sulfide concentrations may reflect sulfide binding capacity rather than the toxic potential of feces. We utilized bismuth subnitrate to quantitate intracolonic sulfide release based on observations that bismuth 1) avidly binds sulfide; 2) quantitatively releases bound sulfide when acidified; and 3) does not influence fecal sulfide production by fecal homogenates. Rats ingesting bismuth subnitrate excreted 350 +/- 18 micromol/day of fecal sulfide compared with 9 +/- 1 micromol/day in control rats. Thus the colon normally absorbs approximately 340 micromol of sulfide daily, a quantity that would produce local and systemic injury if not efficiently detoxified by the colonic mucosa. Studies utilizing bismuth should help to clarify the factors influencing sulfide production in the human colon.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract serves as a barrier between the host and the vast array of foreign antigens that are contained within its lumen. The mucosal immune system must balance two opposing functions: to mount an immune response to pathogens, whilst maintaining tolerance to antigens derived from commensal bacteria and food. This balance is regulated by both cellular interactions and the release of soluble mediators called cytokines. Diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are characterized by alterations in the balance of pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines. Interleukin-10 is a regulatory cytokine which inhibits both antigen presentation and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine release. In addition, there is evidence that it promotes the formation of antigen-specific regulatory T-cell clones. The pivotal role played by interleukin-10 within the mucosal immune system is demonstrated both by the chronic ileocolitis that develops in gene-targeted interleukin-10 knock-out mice, and by its therapeutic efficacy in several animal models of colitis. However, trials of daily systemic interleukin-10 administration in patients with Crohn's disease have reported only a modest clinical response. Advances in the analysis of functional polymorphisms in the interleukin-10 gene may allow therapy to be targeted to patients who will respond. Finally, therapeutic strategies utilizing gene therapy may enhance mucosal delivery and increase therapeutic response.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unknown, although in recent years more data have become available. The contribution of genetic and environmental factors is evident, and the luminal bacterial flora plays a major role in the initiation and perpetuation of chronic IBD. Animal models of IBD have shown that colitis does not occur in a germ-free environment. In human IBD, inflammation is present in parts of the gut containing the highest bacterial concentrations. Moreover, the terminal ileum, caecum and rectum are areas of relative stasis, providing prolonged mucosal contact with luminal contents. Enhanced mucosal permeability may play a pivotal role in maintaining a chronic inflammatory state, due to a genetic predisposition or as a result of direct contact with bacteria or their products. A detective epithelial barrier may cause a loss of tolerance to the normal enteric flora. Furthermore, an increased mucosal absorption of viable bacteria and bacterial products is found in IBD. Serum and secreted antibodies are increased and mucosal T-lymphocytes that recognize luminal bacteria are present. However, there is evidence that the immune system reacts over aggressively towards the normal luminal flora rather than the flora being altered in IBD. Several approaches have been used in attempts to discover a specific microbial agent in the cause of IBD. These include demonstration of the presence of organisms or specific antigens in affected tissues, culture of microbes firm the affected tissues, demonstration of serological responses to several agents, and localization and detection of individual pathogen-specific nucleic acid sequences in affected tissue by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. So far, no specific micro-organism has been directly associated with the pathogenesis of IBD. Analysis of the luminal enteric flora, however, has revealed differences in the composition of this flora compared to healthy controls. In Crohn disease, concentrations of Bacteroides, Eubacteria and Peptostreptococcus are increased, whereas Bifidobacteria numbers are significantly reduced. Furthermore, in ulcerative colitis, concentrations of facultative anaerobic bacteria are increased. The arrival of new molecular techniques qualifying and quantifying the complex intestinal flora has induced a revival of interest in this microflora. Therapeutic approaches geared towards changing the environment at the mucosal border have been attempted by the use of elemental diets, total parenteral nutrition, surgical diversion of the faecal stream and antibiotics. Over the past few years, the use of probiotics in IBD and other intestinal disorders has gained attention. Strengthened by promising experimental data and commercial interests, research in this field is rapidly expanding. Manipulation of the colonic bacteria with antibiotic drugs and probiotic agents may prove to be more effective and better tolerated than immunosuppressants in the future.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Taking live bacteria by mouth to improve health (probiotics) is not intuitively rational yet it is a practice with a long history. As interest in the effects on health of the intestinal flora has developed, along with major advances in the technology for studying it, so has come a new interest in establishing the true benefits of probiotic therapy. This review summarizes the most recent contributions to this rapidly developing area. RECENT FINDINGS: Probiotic bacteria, mainly bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for historical reasons, can prevent or ameliorate some diseases. Many empirical studies have been done, but work to develop the ideal characteristics of probiotics lags behind. Current literature covers survival of probiotics in the gut, mucosal adherence, antibacterial/pathogen mechanisms, effects on immune function and clinical studies. SUMMARY: Probiotic bacteria are effective in preventing and reducing the severity of acute diarrhoea in children. They are also useful in antibiotic associated diarrhoea but not for elimination of Helicobacter pylori. In inflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcerative colitis, probiotics offer a safe alternative to current therapy. Probiotics have been used to prevent urogenital tract infection with benefit and, perhaps more intriguingly, to reduce atopy in children. Probiotics do not invariably work and study of mechanisms is urgently needed.},

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of VSL#3 as a primary therapy in the treatment of colitis in the interleukin (IL)-10 gene-deficient mouse. Mechanisms of action of VSL#3 were investigated in T(84) monolayers. METHODS: IL-10 gene-deficient and control mice received 2.8 x 10(8) colony-forming units per day of VSL#3 for 4 weeks. Colons were removed and analyzed for cytokine production, epithelial barrier function, and inflammation. VSL#3 or conditioned media was applied directly to T(84) monolayers. RESULTS: Treatment of IL-10 gene-deficient mice with VSL#3 resulted in normalization of colonic physiologic function and barrier integrity in conjunction with a reduction in mucosal secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma and an improvement in histologic disease. In vitro studies showed that epithelial barrier function and resistance to Salmonella invasion could be enhanced by exposure to a proteinaceous soluble factor secreted by the bacteria found in the VSL#3 compound. CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of VSL#3 was effective as primary therapy in IL-10 gene-deficient mice, and had a direct effect on epithelial barrier function.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are living microorganisms that can affect the host in a beneficial manner. Prebiotics are nondigestible food ingredients that stimulate the growth and activity of probiotic bacteria already established in the colon. Efficacy of probiotic compounds has been shown in a wide range of gastrointestinal diseases. Lactobacillus GG alone, or the combination of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus, is effective in the treatment of Clostridium difficile, as well as in preventing the frequency and severity of infectious acute diarrhea in children. Prevention of antibiotic-induced diarrhea with the concomitant administration of either Lactobacillus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii has been demonstrated. The most successful studies involve the use of Lactobacillus GG at a dose of 1 x 1010 viable organisms per day and the yeast boulardii at a dose of 1 g/day. A probiotic preparation (VSL#3 - 6 g/day) that uses a combination of three species of Bifidobacterium, four strains of Lactobacillus and one strain of Streptocccus has shown promise in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis and pouchitis, as well as in preventing the postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease. The mechanism of action of probiotics may include receptor competition, effects on mucin secretion or probiotic immunomodulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Oral administration of probiotic compounds has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and safe. However, while probiotics have the potential to improve human health and to prevent and treat some diseases, major improvements are needed in labelling and quality assurance procedures for probiotic compounds. In addition, well planned and controlled clinical studies are necessary to delineate fully the potential for probiotic compounds.},

METHODS: Honey and glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose mixture were administered, orally and rectally, daily for a period of 4 days. Induction of colitis was done on the third day using 3% acetic acid. Animals were killed on day 4 two hours after administration of the dose and colonic biopsies were taken for macroscopic scoring, histopathological and biochemical studies. RESULTS: Honey dose-dependently afforded protection against acetic acid-induced colonic damage. There was almost 100% protection with the highest dose (5 g/kg) used while glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose mixture produced no significant protective effect. Also, honey prevented the depletion of the antioxidant enzymes reduced glutathione and catalase and restored the lipid peroxide malondialdehyde towards normal levels. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are required to explore the active ingredients responsible for the antioxidant effect of honey and its therapeutic potential in humans.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanism of action of elemental diet in Crohn's disease treatment, is unknown. Alteration of bacterial flora, low antigenicity, low fat content and improvement of nutritional status are postulated to play a role in the anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet. AIM: To determine whether elemental diet or its modifications has a direct anti-inflammatory effect on colonic tissue biopsies in vitro. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Colonic or ileal biopsies from 39 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and control patients were incubated for 24 hours with enteral diets in which nitrogen sources were amino acids as in elemental diet, casein or whey. Tissues were incubated with elemental diet, casein or whey, at dilutions of 1:5, 1:10 or 1:20 in Waymouth's complete medium; a medium control was also included. Tissue viability was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and interleukin-10 concentrations in supernatants were measured by immunoassay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). RESULTS: Incubation of tissues from Crohn's disease with elemental diet resulted in an increase in the ratio of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta vs control statistically significant at 1:10 (89.6+/-17 vs 45.7+/-9. 1, p<0.05). Incubation of Crohn's tissue with casein resulted in a significant increase of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio at dilutions 1:20, 1:10 and 1:5 (101.8+/-22.0, p=0.05, 142.8+/-24.6, p<0.05; 109.7+/-25.0, p=0.05). In ulcerative colitis tissue and non-inflamed non-inflammatory bowel disease control tissue, no significant increase in interleukin 1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio was seen after incubation with elemental diet, casein and whey. CONCLUSION: Elemental diet incubation increases anti-inflammatory:proinflammatory cytokine ratio in Crohn's disease and this anti-inflammatory effect is not specifically due to amino acid composition, as diets containing casein have similar anti-inflammatory effects.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: It has been suggested that the consumption of natural "whole foods" rich in macronutrients has many healthful benefits for those who otherwise ingest a normal, nonvegetarian diet. One example is dietary supplements derived from Chlorella pyrenoidosa, a unicellular fresh water green alga rich in proteins, vitamins, and minerals. OBJECTIVE: To find evidence of the potential of chlorella dietary supplements to relieve signs and symptoms, improve quality of life, and normalize body functions in people with chronic illnesses, specifically fibromyalgia, hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials. SETTING: Virginia Commonwealth University's Medical College of Virginia. PATIENTS: Fifty-five subjects with fibromyalgia, 33 with hypertension, and 9 with ulcerative colitis. INTERVENTION: Subjects consumed 10 g of pure chlorella in tablet form and 100 mL of a liquid containing an extract of chlorella each day for 2 or 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For fibromyalgia patients, assessments of pain and overall quality of life. For hypertensive patients, measurements of sitting diastolic blood pressure and serum lipid levels. For patients with ulcerative colitis, determination of state of disease using the Disease Activity Index. RESULTS: Daily dietary supplementation with chlorella may reduce high blood pressure, lower serum cholesterol levels, accelerate wound healing, and enhance immune functions. CONCLUSIONS: The potential of chlorella to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life, and normalize body functions in patients with fibromyalgia, hypertension, or ulcerative colitis suggests that larger, more comprehensive clinical trials of chlorella are warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Essential fatty acid supplementation has been found to ameliorate certain chronic inflammatory diseases. This effect is thought to be mediated through the modulation of eicosanoid synthesis. Pro-inflammatory eicosanoids have been implicated in ulcerative colitis. AIM: To investigate the possible therapeutic benefit of essential fatty acids in quiescent ulcerative colitis to reduce the frequency of disease relapse. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed with a treatment duration of 12 months. Patients with quiescent disease received either trial medication (gamma-linolenic acid, 1.6 g, eicosapentaenoic acid, 270 mg, and docosahexaenoic acid, 45 mg, per day) or placebo (sunflower oil, 500 mg/day). The primary end-point was disease activity, assessed by a previously validated clinical index, sigmoidoscopic appearance and histology. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were randomized, 31 to receive essential fatty acid treatment and 32 to receive placebo. Disease relapse rates were similar at 12 months (placebo, 38%; essential fatty acids, 55%), as were changes in sigmoidoscopic grade from baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The supplementation of the diet with this combination of essential fatty acids does not prolong the period of disease remission of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {1. This in vitro study was designed to determine the potential use of the NK(1) antagonist, SR140333 as an anti-diarrhoeal treatment for food allergy or inflammatory bowel disease. The effect of various immune and neuronal stimuli on human colonic substance P (SP) release and the effect of SR140333 on subsequently stimulated mucosal ion transport was investigated. 2. Submucosal and sensory nerve fibre stimulation using electrical field stimulation (1 ms/7 Hz/7 V) and capsaicin (50 microM) respectively, mast cell activation by anti-IgE (1/250 dilution) and granulocyte stimulation using fMLP (50 microM) each released SP and evoked a secretory response. 3. SP and the NK(1) selective agonist, Sar-SP (0.1 - 1000 nM) stimulated an increase in colonic secretion which was antagonized by SR140333 (pD'(2)=6.7 and 7.25 versus SP and Sar-SP respectively). 4. SR140333, at a concentration that blocked NK(1)-mediated secretion (500 nM), also reduced the secretory response to both alphaIgE and capsaicin. This suggests a pathophysiologic role for NK(1) receptors. 5. Capsaicin evoked SP release was increased in tissue taken from Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis patients. The response to SP was however reduced by 70 and 89% respectively. 6. Mast cells and sensory afferents contribute to allergic diarrhoea. Since SR140333 reduced the secretory response to mast cell and afferent stimulation this compound may be particularly useful in reducing the symptoms of food allergy.},

Rats were treated with 80 mg/kg body of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and fed for 1 or 2 wk diets enriched in olive oil (OO), fish oil (FO), or purified pig brain phospholipids (BPL), as sources of monounsaturated and PUFA of the (n-3) and (n-3) + (n-6) series. Evaluation of macroscopic and microscopic colonic damage was assessed. Ultrastructural and histologic changes were analyzed as well as plasma and colonic mucosa fatty acid profiles and some biochemical markers of injury and inflammation [alkaline phosphatase (AP), mieloperoxidase (MPO), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and leukotriene B(4)]. Fatty acid profiles of both plasma and mucosa mostly reflected the dietary fatty acid composition. Plasma MUFA proportions were higher in UC animals fed the OO diet compared with FO or BPL groups 1 and 2 wk and (n-3) long chain PUFA (LC-PUFA) were higher in the FO than in the OO and BPL groups. At 1 wk, UC led to lower MUFA mucosa levels and (n-3)LC-PUFA were higher in the FO group compared with the OO and BPL groups. Rats with UC fed FO at 1 wk showed significantly less macroscopic and microscopic colonic damage. They also have lower AP and MPO activities and PGE(2) levels compared with the OO and BPL groups and showed enhanced histological repair, less necrotic areas within the mucosa, and more goblet cells with mature mucin granules. These results suggest that the use of balanced diets containing (n-3) LC-PUFA could ameliorate the inflammation and mucosal damage in UC.},

Similar results were obtained after repeated intraperitoneal administration of pleuran in doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg. Pleuran given orally as a 10% food component over 4 weeks was effective in reducing the extent of mucosal damage, but did not prevent the increase of myeloperoxidase in the injured colonic segment. In the segment without macroscopic evidence of inflammation, myeloperoxidase activity was significantly lower as documented by histological examination.

   abstract = {Biological therapies are being increasingly investigated for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. However, a great deal more study has been devoted to studies of Crohn's disease rather than ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis, like Crohn's disease, represents an area of high clinical need, particularly for those patients who have disease inadequately responsive to corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylates. The distinct anatomic distribution of inflammation in ulcerative colitis represents an important model for study, with the entire involved mucosa entirely accessible to endoscopy. In addition, there is an opportunity for local delivery of biologic agents in left-sided disease. Distinct pathogenetic factors in ulcerative colitis raise the possibility of therapies quite different from those used in Crohn's disease. This work describes the current state of knowledge regarding biological therapy in ulcerative colitis. The role of probiotic therapy, and studies of cytokine-directed therapies, therapies targeting adhesion and recruitment, and restitution and repair are described.},

Appendicitis has an incidence of about 5-10% of the number likely to be observed in a white population. The conundrum is that the disparity exists despite many Africans having adopted an urbanized lifestyle with major changes in their dietary pattern. Dietary fiber intake, which was previously 30-35 g, has decreased to 12-14 g daily. Studies on small bowel function in black people have shown that physiological malabsorption of lactose, fructose, sucrose and maize (the staple food) occurs. It is hypothesized that the increased concentration of substrate available for fermentation in the colon compensates for the low dietary fiber intake, is protective to the large bowel and is a factor in the prevention of 'developed society' large bowel diseases in the African population.},

   abstract = {Chronic ulcerative colitis (UC) patients frequently require iron supplementation to remedy anemia due to blood loss. However, the effect of iron supplementation on UC-associated carcinogenesis is unknown. In this study, the effect of an iron-enriched diet on dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute and chronic colitis in mice was assessed. In a short-term study, mice administered 1% DSS in the drinking fluid and an AIN76A diet containing increasing levels of iron exhibited dose-dependent increases in the severity of acute UC as compared to mice fed a control diet. A marked increase in iron deposition on the epithelial surface of the colon and in the inflamed areas and immunostaining for iNOS and nitrotyrosine were observed in the animals supplemented with diets containing different levels of iron. In a long-term carcinogenesis experiment, a twofold iron-enriched diet significantly increased colorectal tumor incidence (14/16, 88%) as compared with animals fed the control diet (3/16, 19%; P < 0.001). The present findings have implications for the management of human UC and suggest that dietary iron can enhance UC and its associated carcinogenesis by augmenting oxidative and nitrosative stress.},

   abstract = {Probiotic therapy is attracting the renewed interest of clinicians and basic investigators from a variety of traditional research disciplines. While the theoretical rationale for modifying the commensal flora of the gastrointestinal tract in specific circumstances appears sound and requires scientific pursuit, the field of probiotics has been clouded by exaggerated claims from some quarters. In general, many of the claims for therapeutic efficacy have not been well substantiated, but the field is now poised for evaluation within the realm of evidence-based medicine. Alterations in commensal bacterial flora within the gastrointestinal tract are associated with susceptibility to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile and there is persuasive evidence that the normal flora may participate in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic diseases in genetically susceptible individuals. This has prompted various strategies to fortify or otherwise modify the enteric flora by dietary supplements containing probiotic formulations. Detailed comparisons of probiotic performance amongst different bacterial strains have not been performed in vivo in man or under clinical trial conditions, and the level of scientific characterisation of individual organisms has been variable. In addition, it cannot be assumed that the same probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Moreover, the heterogeneity of clinical disorders such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis implies that strain-specific properties may be required for subset-specific categories of patients. While cocktails of probiotics offer convenience, therapeutic progress may require clarification of the mechanism of probiotic action and may be delayed until individual bacterial components have been rigorously studied. More importantly, the full potential of therapeutic manipulation of the enteric flora with probiotics or other strategies may not be optimally realised until the composition and metabolic activities of the normal flora are better understood.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mice with a targeted mutation in the G protein subunit G alpha i2 gene develop a colonic mucosal inflammation, with a highly activated B-cell response. We wanted to investigate whether this increased B-cell activity was directed against dietary antigens and/or various self tissues. METHODS: The level of antibodies specific for dietary (gliadin, soya and fish meal) antigens was measured by ELISA. Reactivity against self antigens was measured by immunohistochemistry on cryo-sectioned mouse and rat tissue. Sera and intestinal lavages were analysed from G alpha i2-/- mice before and after development of colitis and in age-matched wild type litter mates. RESULTS: Titres of antibodies against dietary antigens were significantly enhanced both in serum and in large intestinal lavages from G alpha i2-/- mice with ongoing colitis but not prior to disease, as compared to wild type mice. The autoreactivity to self tissues was significantly increased in G alpha i2-/- mice both before and after development of colitis as compared to litter mate control animals. Self tissue reactivity was directed not only against epithelial cells of the colon, small intestine and gastric glands, but also against smooth muscle cells, hepatocytes, bile duct cells, renal tubule and collecting tubule cells of the kidney. In analogy to human ulcerative colitis, autoantibodies against epithelial cells, bile duct epithelium and neutrophil granulocytes were found. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier increase in levels of autoantibodies (before onset of colitis) than of food antibodies (after onset of colitis) suggests the latter response to be a secondary phenomenon to e.g. a destroyed barrier function.},

In this paper, the molecular weight distributions of 29 samples of food-grade refined carrageenans were studied by high performance liquid gel permeation chromatography (GPC) directly connected to vacuum-ultraviolet inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP) (GPC/ICP) as well as GPC/refractive index (RI) detection. All samples of food-grade carrageenan had a major broad peak of high molecular weight which eluted at around 6.5 min in both RI and ICP mode (sulphur and carbon), and each sample of them had no obvious peak of poligeenan (the detection limit was about 5%). The number average molecular weights of these carrageenans ranged from 193 kDa to 324 kDa, and the weight average molecular weights ranged from 453 kDa to 652 kDa based on RI data. Some samples had a few minor peaks which eluted around 10-12 min. These peaks came from ionic sulphate, sucrose or glucose. It was considered that if the data-sampling programme was improved, the GPC/ICP system would become a more powerful technique for evaluation of carrageenan samples containing ionic substances and sugar.},

   abstract = {The mucosal immune system is an integral part of the whole-body immune system, however its regulation, maturation and function are to a great degree independent. Mucosal lymphoid tissue is the largest immune organ of the body, that stands in the first line of defence against foreign invaders. The goal of the immune system is immunity, however immunologic unresponsiveness (tolerance) is a key feature of the mucosal immune system, because the organism must tolerate thousands of ingested and inhaled harmless food and bacterial antigens. The phenomenon of oral tolerance is the unique feature of the mucosal immune system. If abrogated, severe autoimmune diseases like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or coeliac sprue can develop. The quality of mucosal immune responses during newborn and infant age strongly influences the immune reactivity later in life. The most important factors influencing the development of mucosal immune reactivity are the feeding practices and microbial colonization. Manipulation of the mucosal immune system offers interesting possibilities to prevent infection as well as autoimmune diseases directly in the affected tissue, without participation of the whole-body immune system. In this review we present the most recent basic information about the mechanisms of mucosal immunity, ontogeny of mucosal immunity, mucosal tolerance and immunisation and the role of mucosal immunity in an inherited disease in which the main battlefield is the lung mucosa-cystic fibrosis.},

   abstract = {A substantial number of patients with inflammatory bowel disease use complementary therapies to manage their disease, including chiropractic and herbal therapies. The objective of this study was to explore whether providers of these therapies see patients with inflammatory bowel disease and recommend therapies, and to determine their opinions about the treatments that they recommend. The study sample comprised 66 chiropractors, 19 pharmacists, 16 herbalists and 15 health food store employees in Calgary, Alberta. A structured questionnaire containing two patient scenarios (a patient with active ulcerative colitis and a patient with inactive Crohn's disease) was completed either by an in-person interview or by a mailed questionnaire. Most respondents had seen patients with ulcerative colitis, and at least 80% of each group except pharmacists (only 10%) would treat these patients or recommend treatment. Almost all chiropractors used spinal manipulation, whereas herbalists and health food store employees suggested a wide range of different treatments. Chiropractors rated their treatment as moderately effective; herbalists and health food store employees viewed their recommendations as very effective. The results with respect to the second scenario were very similar. The wide range of treatment recommendations by practitioners, who differ greatly in terms of skills, knowledge and experience, has important implications for physician-patient communication, information provision and education regarding complementary and alternative therapies.},
