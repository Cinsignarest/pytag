   abstract = {The estimated prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in Western countries is 7-15%, with a female:male ratio of 2-2.5:1 in IBS patients who seek healthcare services; however, the female predominance is lower in the general population. IBS has a significant impact on health-related quality of life and is associated with a significant healthcare and economic burden. Management of IBS is comprised of general measures and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment. However, there are ongoing efforts to find more effective therapeutic approaches. As advancements in the understanding of the pathophysiology of IBS continue to grow, new and effective treatments with novel mechanisms of action that have the potential to improve relief of IBS symptoms over current treatments are likely to be developed. This article provides an overview of current and emerging therapies for IBS and also highlights sex and gender differences in clinical trials and treatment response.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A sensation of abdominal swelling (bloating) and actual increase in girth (distension) are troublesome features of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is more common in patients with constipation, especially those with delayed transit. AIM: To establish whether a fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 reduces distension in association with acceleration of gastrointestinal transit and improvement of symptoms in IBS with constipation. METHODS: A single centre, randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel group study in which patients consumed the test product or control product for 4 weeks. Distension, orocaecal and colonic transit and IBS symptoms were assessed on an intention-to-treat population of 34 patients. RESULTS: Compared with control product, the test product resulted in a significant reduction in the percentage change in maximal distension [median difference - 39%, 95% CI (-78, -5); P = 0.02] and a trend towards reduced mean distension during the day [-1.52 cm (-3.33, 0.39); P = 0.096]. An acceleration of orocaecal [-1.2 h (-2.3,0); P = 0.049] as well as colonic [-12.2 h (-22.8, -1.6); P = 0.026] transit was observed and overall symptom severity [-0.5 (-1.0, -0.05); P = 0.032] also improved. CONCLUSIONS: This probiotic resulted in improvements in objectively measured abdominal girth and gastrointestinal transit, as well as reduced symptomatology. These data support the concept that accelerating transit is a useful strategy for treating distension.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), as defined by Rome III diagnostic criteria, affects 10-20% of the general population, with women 20-40 years old accounting for the majority of patients. Although variable and intermittent, IBS symptoms may persist for many years. Repeated referrals for medical consultation and diagnostic studies generate huge healthcare costs. Since there is no evidence that IBS leads to more severe gastrointestinal disorders, in absence of alarm symptoms or signs, an invasive diagnostic algorithm is not indicated. Optimal treatment for IBS still needs to be defined. The clinical approach is based on treatment of the prevalent symptom. When pain predominates, antispasmodics are the first choice. In case of diarrhea, loperamide is useful for reducing bowel frequency. Soluble fiber represents the first option in subjects with IBS and constipation or mixed IBS. Dietary integrators composed of probiotics and serotonin precursors are a promising therapeutic option.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is controlled by the independent enteric nervous system. It is also closely connected to the central nervous system, and bi-directional communication exists between them. The communication involves neural pathways as well as immune and endocrine mechanisms. The brain-gut axis plays a prominent role in the modulation of gut functions. Signals from different sources (e.g. sound, sight, smell, somatic and visceral sensations, pain) reach the brain. These inputs are modified by memory, cognition and affective mechanisms and integrated within the neural circuits of the central nervous system, spinal cord, autonomic and enteral nervous systems. These inputs can have physiologic effects, such as changes in motility, secretion, immune function, and blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract. One of the most important neurotransmitters is serotonin that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the most common chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder: the irritable bowel syndrome. It is a biopsychosocial disease, resulting from the dysregulation of the brain-gut axis. Endogenous pain facilitation rather than inhibition, pathologic gradation of visceral perception and reduced threshold for pain are all evident in these patients. Abuse history is common in their anamnesis. Exaggerated conscientiousness, perfectionism, oversensitivity, feeling of deficiency in effectiveness, and higher demand for social parity, neuroticism and alexithymia have been detected among their constant personality features. Females are also characterized by gender role conflict and low assertiveness. Antidepressants and psychotherapy have important roles in their treatment. Also patients with inflammatory bowel disease are characterized by neuroticism and alexithymia and altered mother-child attachment is often described in their anamnesis. Autonomic neuropathy is a frequent and early neurological complication. Reflux disease and obstructive sleep apnea mutually generate each other and their severities significantly correlate. In the celiac disease the most common neurological manifestations are ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and myopathy. Up to 85% of patients with histologically proven coeliac disease have no gastrointestinal symptoms; consequently, measurement of antigliadin antibody titre is therefore vital in all cases of idiopathic ataxia. Complete resolution of neurological symptoms is the result of gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is a common disorder that is associated with a significant impact on both affected individuals and society. While the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome remains unknown, knowledge regarding the normal and abnormal functions of the gut and its complex interactions with the body's nervous systems continue to shed light on the multifactiorial origins of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This article provides an overview of the current knowledge on the therapeutic approaches to irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: A search of the online bibliographic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed in order to identify all relevant articles published between 1980 and 2008. The search was enhanced with the use of a medical librarian. Bibliographies from potentially relevant articles were manually searched. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic options for irritable bowel syndrome are rapidly evolving beyond traditional symptom-based therapies, such as fiber, antispasmodics, antidiarrheals and laxatives and are moving towards agents with organ-specific receptor selectivity directed, in many cases, at specific gastrointestinal functions.},

   abstract = {Dysmenorrhea affects up to 80% of reproductive age women, in many cases causing sufficient pain to dramatically affect social and occupational roles. The prevalence varies across ethnic groups, which in part may reflect varying cultural attitudes toward women and menstruation. Key identified risk factors for dysmenorrhea include age of menarche, body mass, dietary habits, associated uterine bleeding disorders, comorbid pelvic pathology, and psychosocial problems. While much of the focus on the pathogenesis of dysmenorrhea has focused on aberrant inflammatory mediators in the uterine environment, recent studies using experimental quantitative sensory testing suggest central processing of pain is enhanced in many of these women as well, similar to both irritable bowel syndrome and painful bladder syndrome, which are closely related visceral pain disorders. The mainstays of treatment include nonsteroidal antiinflammatories and combined oral contraceptives; although only the former has extensive level I evidence to support its efficacy. Surgical treatments (presacral neurectomy or uterosacral nerve ablation) appear to be beneficial in a subset of women, but are associated with small, but serious, risks of visceral or vascular injury. Complementary and alternative treatments such as vitamin B1 and magnesium supplementation have not been studied as extensively but show some promise as well. In particular, treatments targeting central aberrations in pain processing, as used in chronic pain management, may prove beneficial as a more multidimensional approach to this common malady is accepted in our field.},

This risk is particularly high in case disease and patient characteristics demonstrate a wide variation, such as in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We compared IBS patients who were selected, approached, and randomized to participate in a clinical trial assessing the efficacy of dietary fiber therapy in IBS. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective survey in primary care patients diagnosed with IBS by their general practitioner in the past 2 years selected and invited for participation in a trial. Characteristics were compared between randomized patients (n=193) nonrandomized eligible patients (n=371), and patients not eligible for participating in the trial (n=724). RESULTS: Of the 2,100 IBS patients, 1,288 (61%) returned the questionnaire. Randomized patients had a higher intensity of IBS abdominal pain as compared to the other groups, a higher consultation rate and a longer IBS disease history. Noneligible patients had less active IBS symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Patients randomized do differ from those nonrandomized in IBS disease characteristics. These observations may have implications for the applicability of our research outcome.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To prospectively estimate constipation prevalence and risk factors in pregnancy. METHODS: We enrolled healthy pregnant women in this longitudinal study during the first trimester. At each trimester and 3 months postpartum, participants completed a self-administered bowel symptom questionnaire, physical activity and dietary fiber intake measures, and a prospective 7-day stool diary. Constipation was defined using the Rome II criteria (presence of at least two of the following symptoms for at least one quarter of defecations: straining, lumpy or hard stools, sensation of incomplete evacuation, sensation of anorectal obstruction, manual maneuvers to facilitate defecation, and fewer than three defecations per week). Generalized linear logistic models explored factors associated with constipation during pregnancy. RESULTS: One hundred three women were enrolled with mean (+/-standard deviation) age of 28 (+/-5) years; 54% were nulliparous and 92% white. Constipation prevalence rates were 24% (95% confidence interval [CI] 16-33%), 26% (95% CI 17-38%), 16% (95% CI 8-26%), and 24% (95% CI 13-36%) in the first, second, and third trimesters and 3 months postpartum, respectively. Additionally, irritable bowel syndrome (by Rome II criteria) prevalence rates were 19% (95% CI 12-28%), 13% (95% CI 6-23%), 13% (95% CI 6-23%) and 5% (95% CI 1-13%) in the first, second, and third trimesters and 3 months postpartum, respectively. In multivariable longitudinal analysis, iron supplements (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.04-12.10) and past constipation treatment (OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.50-8.57) were associated with constipation during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Constipation measured using the Rome II criteria affects up to one fourth of women throughout pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition associated with no certain organic cause, though diet and stress are widely implicated. The condition is frustrating for both sufferers and doctors, and there are problems in diagnosing and treating the condition. Eliciting explanatory models (EMs) is a useful tool for understanding how individuals relate to their illnesses and their expectations for treatment, particularly for illnesses with uncertain aetiology like IBS. OBJECTIVES: To understand the EMs, experiences and expectations for management of patients with IBS. METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 51 primary care patients (31 in the UK, 20 in The Netherlands) meeting the Rome II diagnostic criteria for IBS. RESULTS: Although IBS often had a significant dampening effect on daily life, IBS patients made great efforts not to allow the condition to take over their lives. Triggers of symptoms were more important to patients than understanding the underlying aetiology of IBS. Diet and stress were both recognized as important triggers, but views about which foods were problematic and the extent to which stress was modifiable were inconsistent. Diagnosis and treatment were often a confusing and frustrating process, and patients often expected more diagnostic tests than they were offered before receiving a diagnosis of IBS. However, the often poor outcome of medical interventions does not, in general, appear to have a negative impact on the patient-doctor relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the extensive impact of IBS on sufferers' daily life and the frustration that results from repeatedly trying treatments with little effect. Clearly explaining the guidelines for diagnosing IBS and the range of treatment options may help patients to make sense of the diagnostic and treatment processes. The personal EM should be addressed during the consultation with the IBS patient, ensuring that any successive medical interventions match with the patients' disease perception.},

We examined the prevalence of fructose intolerance in IBS and long-term outcome of fructose-restricted diet. METHODS: Two hundred and nine patients with suspected IBS were retrospectively evaluated for organic illnesses. Patients with IBS (Rome II) and positive fructose breath test received instructions regarding fructose-restricted diet. One year later, their symptoms, compliance with, and effects of dietary modification on lifestyle were assessed using a structured interview. RESULTS: Eighty patients (m/f=26/54) fulfilled Rome II criteria. Of 80 patients, 31 (38%) had positive breath test. Of 31 patients, 26 (84%) participated in follow-up (mean=13 mo) evaluation. Of 26 patients, 14 (53%) were compliant with diet; mean compliance=71%. In this group, pain, belching, bloating, fullness, indigestion, and diarrhea improved (P<0.02). Of 26 patients, 12 (46%) were noncompliant, and their symptoms were unchanged, except belching. The mean impact on lifestyle, compliant versus noncompliant groups was 2.93 versus 2.57 (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: About one-third of patients with suspected IBS had fructose intolerance. When compliant, symptoms improved on fructose-restricted diet despite moderate impact on lifestyle; noncompliance was associated with persistent symptoms. Fructose intolerance is another jigsaw piece of the IBS puzzle that may respond to dietary modification.},

   abstract = {Constipation affects 2% to 27% of individuals. It is associated to irritable bowel syndrome in 59% of cases, to a pelvic floor dysfunction in 29% and to a low transit time in 13%. During assessment of patients with constipation the effects of medications and chronic diseases must be discarded and the ideal is to determine which type of functional disorder it present. An algorithm for the management of chronic idiopathic constipation, that includes a recommendation to increase fiber and liquid intake as an initial approach and an orientation to the use of different laxatives, is presented. The usefulness of biofeedback in patients with pelvic floor dysfunction and without organic cause of constipation, is also discussed.},

All members of the Canadian Celiac Association (n=5240) were surveyed with a questionnaire. Respondents included 2681 adults with biopsy-proven celiac disease. The mean age was 56 years. Most common presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (83%), diarrhea (76%), and weight loss (69%). The mean delay in diagnosis was 11.7 years. Diagnoses made prior to celiac disease included anemia (40%), stress (31%), and irritable bowel syndrome (29%). Osteoporosis was common. Prior to diagnosis, 27% of respondents consulted three or more doctors about their symptoms. Delays in diagnosis of celiac disease remain a problem. Associated medical conditions occur frequently. More accurate food labeling is needed. Improved awareness of celiac disease and greater use of serological screening tests may result in earlier diagnosis and reduced risk of associated conditions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a probiotic combination on symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: We investigated the efficiency of a probiotic dietary supplement, containing four strains of lactic acid bacteria, on symptoms of IBS. One hundred and sixteen patients with IBS fulfilling the Rome II criteria were randomized in a parallel group, double-blind study to receive a placebo or a probiotic combination (1 x 10(10) cfu once daily) for four weeks. The symptoms that were monitored weekly included discomfort, abdominal pain, and stool frequency and quality. Quality of life was assessed before and at the end of the treatment using the SF36 and FDD-quality-of-life questionnaires. RESULTS: One hundred subjects completed the study (48 probiotic combination, 52 placebo). The probiotic combination was not superior to the placebo in relieving symptoms of IBS (42.6 versus 42.3% improvement). However, the decrease of abdominal pain between the first and the fourth week of treatment was significantly higher in probiotic treated patients (-41.9 versus -24.2%, P=0.048). Interesting findings from the IBS sub-groups were also observed such as a lower pain score at end point in patients with alternating bowel habits (P=0.023) and an increase of stool frequency in the constipated sub-group from the first week of probiotic treatment (P=0.043). CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic combination was not significantly superior to the placebo in relieving symptoms of IBS. Despite the apparent high placebo response, interesting findings from IBS sub-groups were observed in the field of abdominal pain and stool frequency.},

   abstract = {Relieving abdominal pain is the principal treatment objective for patients with irritable bowel syndrome. No single drug stands out in the treatment strategy for this illness. Antispasmodics, magnesium aluminum silicates, and alverine citrate drugs all remain initial options for treatment, although their prescription is impeded by the fact that an increasing number are no longer approved for reimbursement. Increased dietary fibers often have a harmful effect on symptoms. Some patients are probably intolerant to some foods but there is no satisfactory proof on which to base a restrictive diet. Improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome has made it possible to diversify treatments that act first on one of the key pathophysiologic elements, visceral hypersensitivity. Antidepressants (especially tricyclics) can be used at low doses. Among the serotonergic drugs, serotonin 5-HT4 receptors agonists (tegaserod) may be available soon, but the development of 5-HT3 antagonists (alosetron, cilansetron) has been stopped for safety reasons (ischemic colitis and severe constipation). Non-drug options such as hypnosis, psychotherapy, relaxation, or yoga, may also be proposed to some patients. Probiotics are a possible treatment in the future.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Renewed interest in the use of antibiotics to prevent travellers' diarrhoea has occurred with the availability of non-absorbed (<0.4%) rifaximin, and with evidence that a subgroup of travellers with diarrhoea have progression of their illnesses to postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. AIM: To summarize recently published information and make recommendations on travellers' diarrhoea prevention. METHODS: PubMed was reviewed on 2 January 2008 for 255 articles on the topic of 'travellers diarrhoea' published beginning with 2000 along with the author's extensive file on prevention of travellers' diarrhoea. RESULTS: Exercising care in food and beverage selection, while of unproven value, is recommended during travel to high-risk areas of Latin America, Southern Asia or Africa. An algorithm is presented to identify future travellers, for which chemoprophylaxis is appropriate. The preferred drug for prevention of travellers' diarrhoea is rifaximin, with bismuth subsalicylate or a fluoroquinolone also being effective. Vaccines against the principal cause of travellers' diarrhoea, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, are being developed. CONCLUSIONS: Research is needed to determine the relative effectiveness of exercising care on food and beverage selection and chemoprophylaxis in preventing travellers' diarrhoea and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome during high-risk travel. Enterotoxigenic E. coli vaccines appear to be a promising addition to travel medicine.},

DESIGN: A diet with specially processed cereals (SPC) known to induce ASF production was used in patients with IBS, in an eight-week randomized, placebo-controlled study. SUBJECTS: Eighty-two patients with IBS were randomized to a diet with either SPC or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The overall clinical condition and the quality of life were measured by VAS and SF-36 questionnaire, respectively. The plasma levels of ASF were determined in 14 patients with dominating loose stools before and after diet. RESULTS: All patients significantly (p<0.001) improved in IBS-related symptoms irrespective of active or placebo diet. In an active-diet sub-group with diarrhoea (n=11) there was a significant (p<0.05) correlation between the increase of plasma ASF level and the improvement on the VAS. CONCLUSION: Both study groups improved significantly on the VAS but no additive effect was seen for the active treatment. In the sub-group with loose stools, the SPC diet induced ASF plasma levels in IBS patients and was correlated to significant symptom improvement in the individual patient.},

   abstract = {Cannabinoid receptors (CBR) are located on cholinergic neurons in the brain stem, stomach, and colon. CBR stimulation inhibits motility in rodents. Effects in humans are unclear. Dronabinol (DRO), a nonselective CBR agonist, inhibits colonic motility and sensation. The aim of this study was to compare effects of DRO and placebo (PLA) on colonic motility and sensation in healthy volunteers. Fifty-two volunteers were randomly assigned (double-blind) to a single dose of 7.5 mg DRO or PLA postoperative with concealed allocation. A balloon-manometric assembly placed into the descending colon allowed assessment of colonic compliance, motility, tone, and sensation before and 1 h after oral ingestion of medication, and during fasting, and for 1 h after 1,000-kcal meal. There was an overall significant increase in colonic compliance (P = 0.045), a borderline effect of relaxation in fasting colonic tone (P = 0.096), inhibition of postprandial colonic tone (P = 0.048), and inhibition of fasting and postprandial phasic pressure (P = 0.008 and 0.030, respectively). While DRO did not significantly alter thresholds for first gas or pain sensation, there was an increase in sensory rating for pain during random phasic distensions at all pressures tested and in both genders (P = 0.024). In conclusion, in humans the nonselective CBR agonist, DRO, relaxes the colon and reduces postprandial colonic motility and tone. Increase in sensation ratings to distension in the presence of relaxation of the colon suggests central modulation of perception. The potential for CBR to modulate colonic motor function in diarrheal disease such as irritable bowel syndrome deserves further study.},

   abstract = {As a major component of plant specialized metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways provide anthocyanins for pigmentation, flavonoids such as flavones for protection against UV photodamage, various flavonoid and isoflavonoid inducers of Rhizobium nodulation genes, polymeric lignin for structural support and assorted antimicrobial phytoalexins. As constituents of plant-rich diets and an assortment of herbal medicinal agents, the phenylpropanoids exhibit measurable cancer chemopreventive, antimitotic, estrogenic, antimalarial, antioxidant and antiasthmatic activities. The health benefits of consuming red wine, which contains significant amounts of 3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene (resveratrol) and other phenylpropanoids, highlight the increasing awareness in the medical community and the public at large as to the potential dietary importance of these plant derived compounds. As recently as a decade ago, little was known about the three-dimensional structure of the enzymes involved in these highly branched biosynthetic pathways. Ten years ago, we initiated X-ray crystallographic analyses of key enzymes of this pathway, complemented by biochemical and enzyme engineering studies. We first investigated chalcone synthase (CHS), the entry point of the flavonoid pathway, and its close relative stilbene synthase (STS). Work soon followed on the O-methyl transferases (OMTs) involved in modifications of chalcone, isoflavonoids and metabolic precursors of lignin. More recently, our groups and others have extended the range of phenylpropanoid pathway structural investigations to include the upstream enzymes responsible for the initial recruitment of phenylalanine and tyrosine, as well as a number of reductases, acyltransferases and ancillary tailoring enzymes of phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites. These structure-function studies collectively provide a comprehensive view of an important aspect of phenylpropanoid metabolism. More specifically, these atomic resolution insights into the architecture and mechanistic underpinnings of phenylpropanoid metabolizing enzymes contribute to our understanding of the emergence and on-going evolution of specialized phenylpropanoid products, and underscore the molecular basis of metabolic biodiversity at the chemical level. Finally, the detailed knowledge of the structure, function and evolution of these enzymes of specialized metabolism provide a set of experimental templates for the enzyme and metabolic engineering of production platforms for diverse novel compounds with desirable dietary and medicinal properties.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) experience similar symptoms; however, individuals with IBD have alterations in their digestive tract and an increased probability of developing colorectal cancer, whereas individuals with IBS do not. Although not well documented within the literature, individuals with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders may engage in adverse behaviors regarding their intake of food, regardless of the fact that the "offending agents" have been identified. Further study into these negative behaviors is warranted for healthcare professionals to be provided with a better understanding of the behaviors that individuals with GI disorders knowingly engage in, despite the negative consequences. PURPOSE: The overall objective of this research was to explore the lived experience of women diagnosed with the GI disorders IBD and/or IBS, with an emphasis on the dietary patterns of the women before and after diagnosis. Specifically, this article examines the adverse behaviors that women engaged in with respect to the consumption of food, beverages, and medications. METHODS: Eight women diagnosed with IBD or IBS were recruited from a university campus in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Participants completed a background questionnaire, a 14-day food diary, and a semistructured interview consisting of 8 open-ended questions. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified: family and friend support, control, and adverse behaviors. The focus of this article, the theme of adverse behaviors, consisted of 2 major subthemes: dietary restrictions and issues with medication. All women engaged in adverse behaviors regarding their food intake and/or consumption of medications as related to food intake. CONCLUSIONS: Semistructured interviews with women diagnosed with IBD and IBS revealed that all women felt governed by their bowels to varying degrees. In addition, all women within this sample knowingly engaged in behaviors concerning food/beverages that had the potential to be detrimental to their conditions. A myriad of reasons were given for consuming foods/beverages. Implications for nursing practitioners are discussed.},

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane controlled trials register up to April 2008. Review methods Randomised controlled trials comparing fibre, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil with placebo or no treatment in adults with irritable bowel syndrome were eligible for inclusion. The minimum duration of therapy considered was one week, and studies had to report either a global assessment of cure or improvement in symptoms, or cure of or improvement in abdominal pain, after treatment. A random effects model was used to pool data on symptoms, and the effect of therapy compared with placebo or no treatment was reported as the relative risk (95% confidence interval) of symptoms persisting. RESULTS: 12 studies compared fibre with placebo or no treatment in 591 patients (relative risk of persistent symptoms 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.00). This effect was limited to ispaghula (0.78, 0.63 to 0.96). Twenty two trials compared antispasmodics with placebo in 1778 patients (0.68, 0.57 to 0.81). Various antispasmodics were studied, but otilonium (four trials, 435 patients, relative risk of persistent symptoms 0.55, 0.31 to 0.97) and hyoscine (three trials, 426 patients, 0.63, 0.51 to 0.78) showed consistent evidence of efficacy. Four trials compared peppermint oil with placebo in 392 patients (0.43, 0.32 to 0.59). CONCLUSION: Fibre, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil were all more effective than placebo in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.},

Traditional therapies are sometimes effective in mild disease but are often self-limiting because they focus primarily on individual symptoms. A combination of lifestyle and diet modifications, pharmacologic agents, and therapeutic interventions is usually necessary to address the multiple symptoms characteristic of IBS. One of the major advancements in the treatment of patients with IBS has been the development of US Food and Drug Administration--approved serotonergic therapeutics that specifically target the underlying causes of IBS and provide multisymptom relief by improving gastrointestinal function. Although they are controversial, alternative treatment approaches that target normalization of intestinal bacterial microflora may be helpful for some patients in whom intestinal bacterial overgrowth is present. Patients who have co-existing pelvic floor dysfunction may benefit from physical therapy. Overall, treatment approaches for IBS should address multisymptom relief and improvement of overall patient well-being.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD) are common in school-aged children; however, there is no reliable treatment. AIM: To determine the efficacy of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) for treating FAPD in children. METHODS: A total of 104 children who fulfilled the Rome II criteria for functional dyspepsia (FD), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or functional abdominal pain (FAP) were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in which they received LGG (n = 52), or placebo (n = 52) for 4 weeks. RESULTS: For the overall study population, those in the LGG group were more likely to have treatment success (no pain) than those in the placebo group (25% vs. 9.6%, relative benefit (RB) 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-6.6, number needed to treat (NNT) 7, 95% CI: 4-123). For children with IBS (n = 37), those in the LGG group were more likely to have treatment success than those in the placebo group (33% vs. 5%, RB 6.3, 95% CI: 1.2-38, NNT 4, 95% CI: 2-36) and reduced frequency of pain (P = 0.02), but not pain severity (P = 0.10). For the FD group (n = 20) and FAP group (n = 47), no differences were found. CONCLUSION: The LGG appears to moderately increase treatment success, particularly among children with IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This report is a preliminary comparative study of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms in eight countries, USA, Mexico, Canada, England, Italy, Israel, India, and China. We also assessed global symptom patterns and correlations and relationships to several psychosocial variables. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-nine participants completed a bowel symptom scale composed of four symptoms, abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation as well as two psychosocial questionnaires, quality of relationship and attribution of symptoms to physical or emotional factors. RESULTS: Pain score in Italy, with the least urban population, was significantly higher than six of the seven other countries whereas it was lowest in India and England. Bloating was highest in Italy and constipation was highest in Mexico, both significantly higher than five other countries. Diarrhea was higher in China than five other countries. All significance values were P<0.05. Globally, diarrhea was less common than constipation, P<0.001 and bloating significantly correlated with constipation as well with pain, P<0.05. Composite analysis of psychosocial variables and symptoms indicated that family conflict correlated directly, P<0.05, whereas family support correlated indirectly, P<0.01, with pain and bloating. Pain, bloating and diarrhea were significantly attributed to physical etiology, P<0.01, whereas only diarrhea was attributed to emotional cause, P<0.05. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that there are significant variations in irritable bowel syndrome symptoms in different geographic locations around the world. Various hypotheses that may explain our data such as cultural beliefs, gut contamination, urban and rural location, dietary practice, and psychosocial factors should be further investigated.},

   abstract = {OPINION STATEMENT: Lactose malabsorption is a syndrome producing constellation of symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, and sometimes nausea and/or vomiting. Primary causes of lactose malabsorption due to loss of intestinal lactase activity include genetic/racial lactase nonpersistence, congenital lactase deficiency, and developmental lactase deficiency. Secondary lactose malabsorption can be caused by any disorder that injures the small intestinal mucosa, such as viral gastroenteritis, celiac disease, allergic (eosinophilic) gastroenteritis, and radiation enteritis. The diagnosis depends on careful clinical evaluation and is customarily confirmed with a lactose breath hydrogen test. As the symptoms are nonspecific, many adults diagnosed with lactose malabsorption actually have irritable bowel syndrome. Treatment consists of a trial of eliminating lactose-containing dairy foods, with supplementation of alternative calcium and protein sources. Commercial enzyme products containing beta-galactosidases can be prescribed to help patients digest dietary lactose. Long-term lactose restriction usually is not necessary and can lead to reduced bone mineral density.},

   abstract = {We present the case of a 17-year-old male who was diagnosed at birth with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI). The patient complained of morning-time asthenia and post-prandial drowsiness despite a correct sleep pattern. The physical examination and biological check-up only showed severe vitamin C deficiency (<10 mol/l; normal range: 26-84). The patient's tiredness was attributed to this vitamin C deficiency, which is a frequent side-affect of the fructose-free diet. A change in diet associated with a supplementation in vitamin C was advised, with an increase in vegetable intake, principally avoiding carrots, onions, leaks and tinned sweet-corn. This case offers the opportunity for a review of this rare disease. Two kinds of fructose metabolism disorders (both autosomal recessive) are recognized: 1) essential fructosuria caused by a deficiency of fructokinase, which has no clinical consequence and requires no dietary treatment; 2) HFI, linked to three main mutations identified in aldolase B gene that may be confirmed by fructose breath test, intravenous fructose tolerance test, and genetic testing. In HFI, fructose ingestion generally induces gastro-intestinal (nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, meteorism) and hypoglycemic symptoms. Fasting is well tolerated. If the condition remains undiagnosed, it leads to liver disease with hepatomegaly, proximal tubular dysfunction, and slow growth and weight gain. In conclusion, endocrinologists should be aware of this rare metabolic disease in order to provide careful follow-up, particularly important when the patient reaches adulthood. Moreover, hypoglycemia induced by fructose absorption, unexplained liver disease, irritable bowel syndrome or familial gout in an adult is suggestive of the diagnosis.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Patient education improves clinical outcomes in patients with chronic illness, but little is known about the education needs of patients with IBS. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify: (1) patients perceptions about IBS; (2) the content areas where patients feel insufficiently informed, i.e., "knowledge gaps" about diagnosis, treatment options, etiology, triggers, prognosis, and role of stress; and (3) whether there are differences related to items 1 and 2 among clinically significant subgroups. METHODS: The IBS-Patient Education Questionnaire (IBS-PEQ) was developed using patient focus groups and cognitive item reduction of items. The IBS-PEQ was administered to a national sample of IBS patients via mail and online. ANALYSIS: Frequencies of item endorsements were obtained. Clinically relevant groups, (a) health care seekers or nonhealth care seekers and (b) users or nonusers of the Web, were identified and grouped as MD/Web, MD/non-Web, and non-MD/Web. RESULTS: 1,242 patients completed the survey (371 via mail and 871 online), mean age was 39.3 +/- 12.5 yr, educational attainment 15 +/- 2.6 yr, 85% female, IBS duration 6.9 +/- 4.2 yr, 79% have seen an MD for IBS in the last 6 months, and 92.6% have used the Web for health information. The most prevalent IBS misconceptions included (% of subjects agreeing with the statement): IBS is caused by lack of digestive enzymes (52%), is a form of colitis (42.8%), will worsen with age (47.9%), and can develop into colitis (43%) or malnutrition (37.7%) or cancer (21.4%). IBS patients were interested in learning about (% of subjects choosing an item): (1) foods to avoid (63.3%), (2) causes of IBS (62%), (3) coping strategies (59.4%), (4) medications (55.2%), (5) will they have to live with IBS for life (51.6%), and (6) research studies (48.6%). Patients using the Web were better informed about IBS. CONCLUSION: (1) Many patients hold misconceptions about IBS being caused by dietary habits, developing into cancer, colitis, causing malnutrition, or worsening with age; (2) patients most often seek information about dietary changes; and (3) educational needs may be different for persons using the internet for medical information.},

The objective of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of phytotherapy on symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee. A previous study of Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, acted as a model in the development of the protocol of this investigation. Twenty adults, previously diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knee, were recruited from two Inner London GP practices into this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study carried out in a primary-care setting. All subjects were seen in consultation three times by a herbal practitioner who was blinded to the randomization coding. Each subject was prescribed treatment and given lifestyle advice according to usual practice: continuation of conventional medication where applicable, healthy-eating advice and nutrient supplementation. Individualized herbal medicine was prescribed for each patient, but only dispensed for those randomized to active treatment-- the remainder were supplied with a placebo. At baseline and outcome (after ten weeks of treatment), subjects completed a food frequency questionnaire and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) knee health and Measure Yourself Outcome Profile (MYMOP) wellbeing questionnaires. Subjects completing the study per protocol (n = 14) reported an increased intake of wholegrain foods (p = 0.045) and oily fish (p = 0.039) compared to baseline, but no increase in fruit and vegetables and dairy products intakes. There was no difference in the primary outcome measure of knee health assessed as the difference in the mean response (baseline-week 10) in WOMAC score between the two treatment groups. However, there was, compared with baseline, improvement in the active group (n = 9) for the mean WOMAC stiffness sub-score at week 5 (p = 0.035) and week 10 (p = 0.060) but not in the placebo group (n = 5). Furthermore, for the active, but not the placebo group, the mean WOMAC total and sub-scores all showed clinically significant improvement (> or = 20%) in knee symptoms at weeks 5 and 10 compared with baseline. Moreover, the mean MYMOP symptom 2 sub-score, mostly relating to osteoarthritis (OA), showed significant improvement at week 5 (p = 0.02) and week 10 (p = 0.008) compared with baseline for the active, but not for the placebo group. This pilot study showed that herbal medicine prescribed for the individual by a herbal practitioner resulted in improvement of symptoms of OA of the knee.},

Symptomatic distress and reduced quality of life are compounded by few efficacious treatments available. As researchers continue to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of alternative therapies, it would be useful to gain a patient-perspective of treatment acceptability and identify patient's attitudes towards those modalities considered not acceptable. METHODS: Six hundred and forty-five participants identified from an earlier IBS-prevalence study received a postal questionnaire to evaluate preferences and acceptability of nine forms of treatment. Proportions accepting each form of treatment were calculated and thematic analysis of qualitative data undertaken. RESULTS: A total of 256 (39.7%) of 645 potential respondents completed the questionnaire (mean age 55.9 years, 73% female). Tablets were most acceptable (84%), followed by lifestyle changes (diet (82%), yoga (77%)). Acupuncture (59%) and suppositories (57%) were less acceptable. When explaining lack of acceptability, patient views fell into four broad categories: dislike treatment modality, do not perceive benefit, general barriers and insufficient knowledge. Scepticism, lack of scientific rationale and fear of CAM were mentioned, although others expressed a dislike of conventional medical treatments. Past experiences, age and health concerns, and need for proof of efficacy were reported. CONCLUSION: Most patients were willing to accept various forms of treatment. However, the reservations expressed by this patient-population must be recognised with particular focus directed towards allaying fears and misconceptions, seeking further evidence base for certain therapies and incorporating physician support and advice.},

Because of the prominence of gaseous complaints in IBS, recent investigations have focussed on new insights into pathogenesis and novel therapies of bloating. The evaluation of the IBS patient with unexplained gas and bloating relies on careful exclusion of organic disease with further characterisation of the underlying condition with directed functional testing. Treatment of gaseous symptomatology in IBS should be targeted to pathophysiologic defects whenever possible. Available therapies include lifestyle alterations, dietary modifications, enzyme preparations, adsorbents and agents which reduce surface tension, treatments that alter gut flora, and drugs that modulate gut transit.},

METHODS: A total of 1000 adult patients with CD from the German Celiac Society completed a medical (including bowel) and a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale through a postal survey. RESULTS: Of 412 respondents with reported biopsy-proven diagnosis with major adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) for > or =1 year, 96 (23.3%) patients fulfilled the modified Rome I criteria for IBS. Of these 96 patients, 76 (79.2%) sought help (medical and/or nonmedical) due to bowel symptoms (referred to as patients with IBS). IBS-type symptoms had a significant negative impact on the physical summary score of the SF-36 (p = .05). Mental disorder (OR = 2.29; beta = 0.83; p = .006); female sex (OR = 2.34; beta = 0.85; p = .03), and occasional nonadherence to GFD (OR = 1.74; beta = 0.56; p = .05) were risk factors for IBS-type symptoms. Active medical comorbidities predicted IBS-patient status (OR = 0.40; beta = -0.92; p = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The data support the biopsychosocial model of IBS: IBS-type symptoms in adult patients with CD can be explained through an interaction of clinical and sociopsychological mechanisms.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional GI disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated with alterations in defecation or stool frequency and consistency. In Western industrialized countries, women seek health care services for their symptoms more frequently than men. The cause of IBS is likely multifactorial involving altered motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. Many patients note that their symptoms are exacerbated by diet and stress, and women frequently report menstrual cycle fluctuations in symptoms. Current approaches to IBS management include behavioral management therapies such as dietary intake changes and stress reduction cognitive restructuring. Drug therapies are targeted at altering pain sensitivity, motility, and secretion. This review provides an overview of the pathogenesis of IBS, factors that contribute to gender differences, and current therapeutic approaches for symptom management.},

To investigate the relationship between platelet depleted plasma 5-HT (PDP 5-HT) concentration and sigmoid-colonic motility in patients with IBS and healthy volunteers. Pre- and postprandial PDP 5-HT concentrations were assessed while recording sigmoid-colonic motility in 35 IBS patients (aged 19-53 years, eight male) and 16 healthy volunteers (aged 18-39 years, six male). Motility was recorded using a five-channel solid-state catheter introduced to a depth of 35 cm into an unprepared bowel. 5-Hydroxytryptamine concentration was measured by reverse-phase HPLC with fluorimetric detection. Irritable bowel syndrome patients had elevated concentrations of PDP 5-HT under fasting (P < 0.004) and fed (P = 0.079) conditions compared with controls. Likewise, they exhibited increased sigmoid-colonic motility under fasting (activity index: P < 0.02) and fed (P < 0.05) conditions compared with controls. Platelet depleted plasma 5-HT concentration positively correlated with colonic activity index under both fasting (r = 0.402; P = 0.003) and fed (r = 0.439; P = 0.001) conditions. These data show a possible relationship between endogenous concentrations of 5-HT and sigmoid-colonic motility recorded in both IBS and healthy subjects.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Between 4% and 25% of school-age children complain of recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) of sufficient severity to interfere with daily activities. It is unclear whether the diagnosis includes children with different aetiologies for their pain. For the majority no organic cause for their pain can be found on physical examination or investigation. Although most children are likely managed by reassurance and simple measures, a large range of interventions have been recommended. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of dietary interventions for recurrent abdominal pain in school-age children. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) 2006 (Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2006), EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2006), CINAHL (1982 to Dec 2007), ERIC (1966 to Dec 2006), PsycINFO (1872 to Dec 2006), LILACS (1982 to Dec 2006), SIGLE (1980 to March 2005), and JICST (1985 to 06/2000) were searched . Where appropriate, search filters were employed. In addition, researchers working in this area were asked to identify relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised studies of any dietary treatment versus placebo or no treatment in school-age children with a diagnosis of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorder based on the Rome II criteria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed quality and extracted data. Where appropriate studies were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Seven trials were included in this review. Two trials, including 83 participants, compared fibre supplements with placebo (Christensen 1982, Feldman 1985), with data from one study reported in two papers (Christensen 1982, Christensen 1986). The pooled odds ratio for improvement in the frequency of abdominal pain was 1.16 (95% CI 0.45-2.87). Two trials, including 90 participants (Lebenthal 1981, Dearlove 1983) compared lactose-containing with lactose-free diets. Neither reported data in a form which could be used in the meta-analysis and the former trial had a loss to follow-up of 45%. We were not able to obtain further data for either trial. Three trials (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007, Young 1997) comparing supplementation with Lactobacillus with placebo met the inclusion criteria but only two (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007), including a total of 168 children, provided analysable data. The pooled odds ratio for improvement of symptoms was 1.17 (95% CI 0.62, 2.21). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of high quality evidence on the effectiveness of dietary interventions. This review provides no evidence that fibre supplements, lactose free diets or lactobacillus supplementation are effective in the management of children with RAP.},

For the majority of such children, no organic cause for their pain can be found on physical examination or investigation. Although most children are managed by reassurance and simple measures, a large range of psychosocial interventions including cognitive and behavioural treatments and family therapy have been recommended. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for recurrent abdominal pain or IBS in school-age children. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) 2006 (Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2006), EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2006), CINAHL (1982 to Dec 2006), ERIC (1966 to Dec 2006), PsycINFO (1872 to Dec 2006), LILACS (1982 to Dec 2006), SIGLE (1980 to March 2005), and JICST (1985 to 06/2000) were searched with appropriate filters. SELECTION CRITERIA: Any study in which the majority of participants were school-age children fulfilling standard criteria for RAP (Apley or the Rome II criteria for functional gastrointestinal diseases) , randomly allocated to any psychosocial treatment compared to standard care or waiting list, were selected. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: References identified by the searches were independently screened against the inclusion criteria by two reviewers. Data were extracted and analysed using RevMan 4.2.10. MAIN RESULTS: Six randomised trials (including a total of 167 participants) of cognitive behavioural interventions were identified, with data reported in ten papers. Five studies reported statistically significant improvements in pain, measured in a variety of ways, in children randomised to receive interventions based on cognitive behavioural therapy compared to children on wait lists or receiving standard medical care (Duarte 2006; Humphreys 1998; Robins 2005; Sanders 1989; Sanders 1994). The remaining trial (Hicks 2003) included a wider group of children with recurrent pain and too few with only RAP to provide interpretable data. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The included trials were small, with methodological weaknesses and a number failed to give appropriate detail regarding numbers of children assessed. In spite of these methodological weaknesses and the clinical heterogeneity, the consistency and magnitude of the effects reported provides some evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy may be a useful intervention for children with recurrent abdominal pain although most children, particularly in primary care, will improve with reassurance and time.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The overall objective of this investigation was to study the lived experience, in relation to diet, of women who have been diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and/or Irritable Bowel Syndrome. This study specifically explored pre-illness and postdiagnosis dietary patterns of participants with an emphasis on the changes, if any, that participants had made to their diet. METHODS: This study took place on a university campus in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Eight women between the ages of 18 and 23 years were recruited. Participants completed a consent form, background questionnaire, and a 14-day food diary. Participant also engaged in one-on-one semistructured interviews that consisted of 8 open-ended questions aimed at gaining a thorough understanding of the lived experience of these women, with respect to their dietary practices. RESULTS: The 3 major themes identified included: control; family and friend support; and adverse behaviors. The salient theme of control included the subthemes timing and awareness of surroundings, giving into temptations, and determination of diet. Determining one's diet, the subtheme that is addressed in this article, involved several key elements, including (1) the role of the physician(s), (2) experimentation, (3) seeking information, and (4) food modifications. CONCLUSIONS: Diet was the primary behavioral factor manipulated by participants to manage their conditions. The determination of potential trigger foods/beverages, however, entailed an often frustrating process of trial and error, in which few of the women received assistance from primary healthcare professionals. As a result, many of the women sought dietary information from alternate sources, some of which may not provide reliable information. Through experimentation and, for some, the documentation of food intake and symptom production, all participants identified food/beverage items they believed to cause symptom development. Although similar items were identified by many, all participants had individual triggers and sensitivities.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Probiotics, defined as live micro-organisms with beneficial effects for the host, are widely applied in gastrointestinal and liver diseases. AIM AND METHOD: To review the available evidence of clinical trials on probiotics in gastrointestinal and liver diseases, with a major focus on irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis and chronic liver diseases. RESULTS: Evidence for the therapeutic or preventive application of particular probiotic strains is available for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, rota-virus-associated diarrhoea and pouchitis. Results are encouraging for irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and for reducing side effects by Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies, but are less clear for Crohn's disease, lactose intolerance and constipation. In general, for most of these patient groups, more placebo-controlled methodologically well-designed studies that pay attention to both clinical outcome and mechanistic aspects are required. The application in liver disease and pancreatitis is promising, but more human trials have to be awaited. Possible mechanisms of probiotics include modulation of the intestinal microbiota and the immune system, but different bacterial may have different effects. CONCLUSION: Further insight into disease entities and the functioning of probiotic strains is required to be able to select disease-specific strains, which have to be tested in well-designed placebo-controlled studies.},

   abstract = {It has been suggested but not proven that hypersensitivity type I reactions are involved in the pathogenesis of canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The main effector cells in type I hypersensitivity reactions are mast cells (MCs). Canine MCs, as human MCs, can be subdivided into three subtypes according to their content of mast cell-specific proteases: tryptase (MCT), chymase (MCC), or tryptase and chymase bearing MCs (MCTC). In this study, numbers and subsets of mast cells were investigated in biopsies from the gastrointestinal tract of dogs with histopathologically confirmed lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis (LPE) (n=4), lymphocytic-plasmacytic colitis (LPC) (n=1) and eosinophilic gastroenterocolitis (EGE) (n=11). Paraffin sections of formalin-fixed samples from the stomach, small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) and colon were stained by using a metachromatic staining method (kresylecht-violet; KEV) and a combined enzyme histochemical and immunohistochemical technique for chymase and tryptase. Additionally, immunohistochemistry with antibodies against T cells (CD3), macrophages (myeloid/histiocyte antigen) and IgA, IgG and IgM bearing cells was conducted. Quantitative evaluation of mast cells and semiquantitative scoring of immunohistochemically stained cells were performed. Between the two histopathologically defined groups clear differences concerning mast cell numbers were detected. In most affected intestinal tissue locations of dogs with LPE/LPC a decrease in metachromatically (kresylecht-violet) stained granule-containing MCs and immunohistochemically stained MCT,C,TC was found. This reduction could be due to mast cell degranulation, a T helper cell 1 dominated reaction pattern or a "thinning out" due to increasing T cells, IgA and IgG bearing cells. Dogs with EGE displayed higher variability in mast cell numbers but most of the affected large and small intestinal locations had increased numbers of MCs. In these cases, T cells, IgA bearing cells and macrophages also increased. Increased numbers of MCs and eosinophils seen in the intestinal mucosa of dogs with EGE could indicate the presence of a type I hypersensitivity reaction (T helper cell 2 pattern) in response to dietary antigens. Changes in cell numbers occurred also in unaffected locations of dogs with LPE/LPC and EGE which showed reduced MCT,C,TC, increased KEV positive cells and partially increased leucocytes and macrophages.},

   abstract = {Many patients with diabetes mellitus suffer from upper and lower GI symptoms. The reported prevalence of these symptoms varies among different ethnic groups/populations. The natural history of GI symptoms as well as their pathogenesis in patients with diabetes remains poorly understood, although it is known that gastric emptying is influenced by hyperglycemia, euglycemia, and hypoglycemia. Poor glycemic control over a long period of time can lead to neuropathy and damage the vagus nerve, resulting in diabetic gastroparesis whose signs and symptoms vary in the individual patient. Gastroparesis can further worsen glycemic control by adversely altering the pharmacokinetics of orally administered hypoglycemic agents as well as by altering the delivery of diet-derived calories to intestines from which absorption, subsequently, determines incipient blood glucose, and thus effectiveness of various injectable antidiabetics including various insulins and related insulin analogs. As GI symptoms may overlap with other disorders, including functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and depression, it is important to have such patients/patients with diabetes undergo standardized testing for measuring gastric emptying. Certain medications including metformin, amylin analogues (i.e. pramlintide), glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs (i.e. exenatide, liraglutide), anticholinergic agents, antidepressants, calcium-channel blockers, and others may contribute to GI symptoms observed in patients with diabetes. Given the global diabetes pandemic, it is of utmost importance to not only diagnose and treat present patients with diabetes mellitus and its comorbidities, but also to help prevent the development of further disease burden by educating children and adolescents about healthy lifestyle modifications (avoidance of overeating, portion control, healthy food choices, increased physical and reduced sedentary activity), as changing behavior in adulthood has proven to be notoriously difficult.},

   abstract = {Modern molecular nutrition focuses on health promotion, disease prevention and performance improvement through diet. In analogy to Pharmacogenetics and -genomics, the disciplines "Nutrigenetics" and "Nutrigenomics" have evolved. Nutrigenetics asks how individual genetic disposition, manifesting as single-nucleotide- and copy-number polymorphisms as well as epigenetic regulation, affects susceptibility to diet. Nutrigenomics addresses the inverse relationship, i.e. how diet influences gene transcription, protein expression and metabolism. The long-term objective of Nutrigenomics is personalised nutrition for maintenance and improvement of individual health and for disease prevention. Transcriptomics can put Proteomics- and Metabonomics-derived markers into a larger biological perspective. Metabonomics is a diagnostic tool for metabolic classification of individuals with the asset of quantitative, non-invasive analysis of easily accessible human body fluids such as urine, blood and saliva. This feature also applies to some extent to Proteomics, with the constraint that the latter discipline is more complex in terms of composition and dynamic range of the sample. Apart from addressing the most complex "Ome", Proteomics represents the only platform that delivers not only markers for disposition and efficacy but also targets of intervention. Application of integrated Omic technologies will drive the understanding of interrelated pathways in healthy and pathological conditions and will help to define molecular 'switchboards', necessary to develop disease related biomarkers. This will contribute to the development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies for both pharmacological and nutritional interventions. This paper reviews inflammatory gut disorders, the state-of-the-art of the three Omics platforms and discusses the implication of the latter in biomarker revelation for nutritionally actionable inflammatory disorders in the intestine.},

METHODS: One hundred and seventy nine patients (83% females; mean age, 45) with chronic constipation according to Rome II criteria were initially treated by dietary advice and functional reeducation and those unresponsive (110 or 61.5%) were submitted to colonic transit time, defecography, anorectal manometry and electromyography, as needed. RESULTS: A differential diagnosis was achieved in 63.6% of patients tested. However, 61.5% of 179 patients with chronic constipation (69 with no need to tests and 40 with normal tests) have etiologic diagnosis established only on clinical basis. Irritable bowel syndrome (32%), pelvic floor dysfunction (29%) and functional constipation due to faulty diet and life style habits (22%) were the main causes of chronic constipation. Alternating constipation and nausea/vomiting were symptoms significantly related to the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome; younger age, larger intervals between bowel movements, occurrence of fecal impaction and necessity of enema were related to the diagnosis of non-chagasic megacolon and digital assistance to evacuate and large rectocele or spastic pelvic floor on rectal exam were associated to pelvic floor dysfunction. Patients with long-standing constipation, fecal impaction, abdominal pain not eased after defecation, necessity for enemas, digital assistance and evidence of rectocele tended to be in need for physiologic tests to define the cause of chronic constipation. CONCLUSIONS: The etiologic diagnosis of chronic constipation can be achieved in most of patients on a clinical basis and some symptoms may be significantly related to specific diagnoses. Indications for physiologic tests should be based on specific clinical parameters.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, chronic disorder that reduces patients' quality-of-life. Although highly prevalent, little is known about patients' understanding of this disorder. AIM: To evaluate the knowledge, fears and concerns of IBS patients. METHODS: Seven hundred thirty-six IBS patients (Rome II criteria) were eligible for inclusion in this prospective study. Each patient received a validated questionnaire to evaluate knowledge, attitudes and fears regarding IBS. RESULTS: A total of 261 of 664 potential respondents completed the questionnaire (39.3%). 83% of respondents were women, with a mean age of 53.7 years, and mean duration of symptoms of 14.2 years. Patients frequently believed that IBS develops because of anxiety (80.5%), dietary factors (75.1%) and depression (63.2%). Few respondents (28.7%) recognized that abdominal pain is the cardinal symptom of IBS, and 40.6% stated that colonoscopy can diagnose IBS. One in seven patients stated that IBS turns into cancer, and 29.9% noted that IBS increases the risk of inflammatory bowel disease. CONCLUSIONS: Many IBS patients have significant misconceptions regarding the nature of their disease and its prognosis. An overwhelming majority of IBS patients believe that anxiety, dietary factors and depression cause IBS. These findings are discordant with physicians' views and practices and highlight the need for patient-oriented educational programs.},

   abstract = {The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is complex and incompletely known. Very little has been studied regarding the role of submucous neuronal activity. We therefore measured small intestinal transmural potential difference (PD, reflecting mainly electrogenic chloride secretion), and its linkage with fasting motor activity [migrating motor complex (MMC)] in controls (n = 16) and patients with IBS [n = 23, 14 diarrhoea predominant (d-IBS) and nine constipation predominant (c-IBS)]. Transmural-PD and its relation to MMC phase III was measured by modified multilumen manometry for 3 h in the fasting state using one jejunal and one duodenal infusion line as flowing electrodes. The amplitude and duration of motor phase III was similar in controls and IBS patients, but the propagation speed of phase III was higher in IBS patients. In IBS patients, maximal PD during MMC phase III was significantly elevated in both the duodenum and jejunum (P < 0.05) and the PD decline after phase III was significantly prolonged in the jejunum (P < 0.01). The PD elevation was seen in both duodenum and jejunum in d-IBS patients, but only in the jejunum in the c-IBS patients. On the basis of previous modelling studies, we propose that the enhanced secretion may reflect disturbed enteric network behaviour in some patients with IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nonresponsive celiac disease (NRCD) is a common problem affecting from 7% to 30% of celiac patients. Because NRCD comprises varied and potentially morbid entities, efficient and cost-effective patient care requires knowledge of the specific causes of this disorder. The aim of this study was to determine the common etiologies of NRCD in a tertiary referral center. METHODS: All cases of biopsy examination-proven celiac disease (CD) seen at our institution over the preceding 5 years were included in this study. NRCD was defined as a failure to respond to at least 6 months of treatment with a gluten-free diet or the re-emergence of symptoms or laboratory abnormalities typical of CD while still on treatment with a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients with NRCD meeting the earlier-described criteria were seen from a total of 603 patients with CD (19%), however, among patients for whom we provided primary specialist care the incidence of NRCD was 10% (P < .001). Gluten exposure was the most common cause of NRCD (36%), followed by irritable bowel syndrome (22%), refractory CD (10%), lactose intolerance (8%), and microscopic colitis (6%). The mean immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase level in the gluten-exposed group was 67 vs 17 U/mL (normal, <20) for other diagnoses (P < .05). Weight loss and male sex were highly predictive of refractory CD (P < .05 and < .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: NRCD is a common phenomenon affecting 10%-19% of celiac patients. A limited number of etiologies account for the majority of cases. Clinical factors may be used to guide evaluation.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) are reported to have a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms partly attributed to an overrepresentation of celiac disease. We have observed that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms are frequent complaints in this patient group. Allergic manifestations to various drugs are also common in pSS. A role of food allergy in IBS has been proposed. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at evaluating the mucosal response to rectal challenge with cow's milk protein (CM) in patients with pSS and relates possible CM reactivity to their intestinal symptoms. METHODS: A rectal challenge with CM was performed in 21 patients with pSS and 18 healthy controls. Fifteen hours after challenge the mucosal production of nitric oxide (NO) and the release of myeloperoxidase (MPO) as signs of mucosal inflammatory reaction were measured using the mucosal patch technique. RESULTS: Eight out of 21 patients with pSS had a definite increase of mucosal NO synthesis and the luminal release of MPO after rectal CM challenge. This sign of milk sensitivity was not linked to IgG/IgA antibodies to milk proteins. The symptoms for IBS according to Rome III criteria were fulfilled in 13 patients. All patients who were CM sensitive suffered from IBS. In a small open study, patients reactive to CM reported an improvement of intestinal symptoms on a CM-free diet. CONCLUSION: A rectal mucosal inflammatory response after CM challenge is seen in 38% of patients with pSS as a sign of CM sensitivity. IBS-like symptoms were common in pSS, linked to CM sensitivity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 70% of the world population has hypolactasia, which often remains undiagnosed and has the potential to cause some morbidity. However, not everyone has lactose intolerance, as several nutritional and genetic factors influence tolerance. AIMS: To review current clinical practice and identify published literature on the management of lactose intolerance. METHODS: PubMed was searched using the terms lactose, lactase and diet to find original research and reviews. Relevant articles and clinical experience provided the basis for this review. RESULTS: Lactose is found only in mammalian milk and is hydrolysed by lactase in the small intestine. The lactase gene has recently been identified. 'Wild-type' is characterized by lactase nonpersistence, often leading to lactose intolerance. Two genetic polymorphisms responsible for persistence have been identified, with their distribution concentrated in north Europeans. Symptoms of lactose intolerance include abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence and diarrhoea. Diagnosis is most commonly by the lactose hydrogen breath test. However, most people with hypolactasia, if given appropriate advice, can tolerate some lactose-containing foods without symptoms. CONCLUSION: In clinical practice, some people with lactose intolerance can consume milk and dairy foods without developing symptoms, whereas others will need lactose restriction.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in the outpatient with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a difficult but important challenge to recognize and treat. It is very helpful to have effective treatment approaches for IBS that are practical and use minimal medications. Because of the underlying chronic inflammation in IBD, IBS symptoms occur with increased frequency and severity, secondary to increased hypersensitivity to foods and beverages that stimulate the gastrointestinal tract. This paper discusses how to treat IBS in the IBD outpatient, with emphasis on using a food and beverage intolerance, avoidance diet. The adverse effects of many foods and beverages are amount dependent and can be delayed, additive, and cumulative. The specific types of foods and beverages that can induce IBS symptoms include milk and milk containing products; caffeine containing products; alcoholic beverages; fruits; fruit juices; spices; seasonings; diet beverages; diet foods; diet candies; diet gum; fast foods; condiments; fried foods; fatty foods; multigrain breads; sourdough breads; bagels; salads; salad dressings; vegetables; beans; red meats; gravies; spaghetti sauce; stews; nuts; popcorn; high fiber; and cookies, crackers, pretzels, cakes, and pies. The types of foods and beverages that are better tolerated include water; rice; plain pasta or noodles; baked or broiled potatoes; white breads; plain fish, chicken, turkey, or ham; eggs; dry cereals; soy or rice based products; peas; applesauce; cantaloupe; watermelon; fruit cocktail; margarine; jams; jellies; and peanut butter. Handouts that were developed based upon what worsens or helps IBS symptoms in patients are included to help patients learn which foods and beverages to avoid and which are better tolerated.},

Prokinetic agents as metoclopramide, domperidone, erythromycin or tegaserod are used in clinical settings. We discuss their use in functional dyspepsia and gastroparesis. Management of chronic constipation consists of increasing fluid and dietary fiber intake and increasing physical activity. Fiber, lubricants, osmotic and stimulative laxatives increase stool frequency and improve symptoms of constipation. Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) should focuses on the specific gastrointestinal complaints. In constipation predominant IBS fiber and isoosmotic laxatives are used first line. Tegaserod has an advantage over placebo in constipation-predominant IBS. Pain can be treated with antispasmodic agents and tricyclic antidepressants in low doses. The diarrhea-predominant IBS responds well to a loperamide treatment.},

Usually no structural and/or biochemical alterations can be demonstrated. This condition is, therefore, considered to be due to functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or functional dyspepsia. Previous observations suggest the presence of a rare alteration of celiac vessels among the possible causes of RAP. This pathological condition was known as Dunbar syndrome. We report 2 cases of chronic abdominal pain. The former reported weight loss and the latter anemia with iron deficiency. It is remarkable that patients with initial diagnosis of IBS can be affected by celiac disease (CD), which is the cause of their abdominal pain. Our patients were tested for CD; the former was negative and IBS was diagnosed, the latter was positive and a gluten free diet was prescribed. The presence of an epigastric bruit, accentuated during expiration, suggested a possible vascular alteration known as tripod celiac artery compression syndrome. Duplex Doppler sonography suggests the diagnosis of celiac arterial constriction due the diaphragmatic ligament. These cases show that tripod celiac artery compression syndrome might be a cause of RAP and that it may be evaluated and investigated when the clinical examination discloses an abdominal systolic bruit.},

   abstract = {Nowadays, the regular consumption of pre- and probiotics is recommended to provide various positive health benefits. The in vitro and in vivo demonstrated actions on the intestinal microflora, the mucosal barrier and the immunological system are very interesting to propose beneficial health effects, but the scientific proof in humans is not demonstrated yet. Pre- and probiotics are very active in the intestinal tract (mainly in the colon) by maintaining a healthy gut microflora and influencing metabolic, trophic and protective mechanism. Prebiotics stimulates the growth of apathogen bacteria and increase the short chain fatty acid concentration by fermentation. Short chain fatty acids are necessary substrates for a healthy gut. Probiotics inhibit the growth of pathogen bacteria, reduce the translocation of bacteria and toxins and modulate the intestinal immune system. For some specific clinical diseases (ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, diarrhoea) a therapeutic and prophylactic effect with pre- and probiotics was shown. In the near future more indications for pre- and probiotics (used as a single strain or as in a combination) will be added. Promising results are already shown in irritable bowel syndrome, prevention of antibiotic induced diarrhoea, in surgical and in intensive care patients. Future studies should focus to determine the characteristics of a healthy gut and the evaluation of specific health benefits by well-designed, controlled human studies of adequate duration.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Serotonin (5-HT) is among other factors involved in gastrointestinal motility, secretion and visceral sensation. Available data suggest that secretion and metabolism of 5-HT may be disturbed in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Interpretation of these observations have been hampered by the variable methodology used and small numbers of patients involved in the previous studies. Aim of this study was to measure serum 5-TH concentration under fasting condition in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), compared with controls (K). The metabolite of serotonine--5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) in urine was also assessed. METHODS: 71 subjects, aged 19-50 years were included in this study. Three groups were distinguished: group I (n=25)--healthy volunteers, group II (n=23)--patients with constipation predominant (IBS-C), group Ill (n=23)--subjects with diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). IBS was diagnosed according to Rome Ill Criteria. On the day of the experiment, patients received a standard meal (Nutridrink 6 x 300 kcal) and blood samples were collected during fasting. 5-HIAA concentration was determined in 24-hour urine collection. Concentration of 5-HT and 5-HIAA was measured by immunoenzyme ELISA method employing standard kits IBL nr RE59121 i RE59131 and Labsystems Multiscan detector. RESULTS: The average serotonin concentration during fasting was found in group I--156.67 +/- 49.12 ng/ml, in group II--221.73 +/- 91.56 ng/ml (p < 0.05), in group III--3.50 +/- 1.71 mg/24h. 5- HIAA concentration in urine was decreased in group Ill--3.50 +/- 1.71 mg/24 hrs (p < 0.05) and group II--4.37 +/- 2.95 mg/24 hrs compared with healthy volunteers--5.65 +/- 2.31 mg/24 hrs. CONCLUSION: (1) Serotonin concentration is increased in C-IBS and D-IBS patients. (2) Urine 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid excretion is decreased in IBS-subjects. (3) Disturbed metabolism of serotonin probably may play role in pathogenesis of functional bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {The effect of a strong, lipophilic statin (pitavastatin) on the thoracic aorta has not yet been elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of pitavastatin (P) therapy on plaque components and morphology in the thoracic aorta by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and clarify the impact of the therapy on media and intima in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Sixty-four media and 64 intima of the thoracic aorta were investigated in 32 patients with hypercholesterolemia. The corrected integrated backscatter (c-IBS) values in the thoracic aortic wall and intima-media thickness (IMT) at the same site were measured before and after P therapy or diet (D) for 7 mo. Moreover, c-IBS values in media were measured in 168 patients without hypercholesterolemia to estimate age-dependent changes. C-IBS values in media were correlated with age (r = 0.84, p < 0.001). C-IBS and IMT of media in the P group significantly decreased from -17.8 +/- 2.4 to -20.1 +/- 3.7 dB and from 1.7 +/- 0.3 to 1.5 +/- 0.3 mm, respectively (p < 0.001), whereas those in the D group significantly increased from -18.3 +/- 2.0 to -16.7 +/- 2.1 dB and from 1.6 +/- 0.3 to 1.7 +/- 0.2 mm, respectively (p < 0.001). IMT in intima in the P group significantly decreased from 3.7 +/- 0.4 to 3.3 +/- 0.4 mm (p < 0.001). C-IBS in intima in the P group significantly increased from -10.2 +/- 2.2 to -6.9 +/- 1.7 dB, which indicated plaque stabilization. Pitavastatin improved the atherosis measured by IMT and sclerosis measured by c-IBS values in the media and induced stabilization and regression of plaques in the intima of the thoracic aorta.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder characterized by abdominal pain, change in bowel habit, and bloating. It has traditionally been viewed as a disorder of visceral hypersensitivity heavily influenced by stress, and therefore therapeutic strategies to date have largely reflected this. However, more recently, there is good evidence for a role of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in its pathogenesis. Changes in fecal microbiota, the use of probiotics, the phenomenon of postinfectious IBS, and the recognition of an upregulated host immune system response suggest that an interaction between the host and GI microbiota may be important in the pathogenesis of IBS. This article explores the role of the GI microbiota in IBS and how their modification might lead to therapeutic benefit.},

   abstract = {Constipation is a common gastrointestinal disease affecting 2-27% of the population in Western hemisphere. Approximately in half of patients the diagnosis of functional constipation is made after having ruled out secondary causes. Treatment of chronic functional constipation primarily addresses education on toilet habits, dietary advice, and patient reassurance. Further therapies are guided according to functional subtype slow-transit constipation, dyssynergic defecation, and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C). Traditionally, the pharmacologic treatment of constipation uses primarily bulking agents and/or laxatives (osmotic or secretory). However, often these therapies do not provide the desired improvement, have a short-lived efficacy and/or are accompanied by side-effects such as bloating and abdominal cramps. Thus, there is a clinical need for new, more potent drugs particularly for patients who are not satisfactorily treated by conventional therapies. This review discusses recent developments in the pharmacologic treatment of chronic constipation including recently FDA-approved lubiprostone, emerging 5-HT receptors modifiers, investigational substances, and probiotics.},

Functional chronic constipation consists of three overlapping subtypes: slow transit constipation, dyssynergic defecation, and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. The Rome criteria may serve as a useful guide for making a clinical diagnosis of functional constipation. Today, an evidence-based approach can be used to treat patients with chronic constipation. The availability of specific drugs for the treatment of chronic constipation, such as tegaserod and lubiprostone, has enhanced the therapeutic armamentarium for managing these patients. Randomized controlled trials have also established the efficacy of biofeedback therapy in the treatment of dyssynergic defecation.},

The hormones that modulate gastric motility represent targets for gastric prokinetic drugs, and peptides that modify eating behaviours may be targeted to develop drugs that reduce nausea, a currently poorly treated condition. The gut-brain axis may therefore provide a range of therapeutic opportunities that deliver a more holistic treatment of upper gastrointestinal disorders.},

   abstract = {Although diarrhea is a common complaint, its evaluation and treatment can be challenging. Appropriately defining and classifying diarrhea provide the framework for approaching diagnostic and therapeutic options. Diarrhea can be defined based on frequency, consistency, and/or weight, and classified as acute or chronic with specific clinical characteristics and stool appearance. Colonoscopy is the most common diagnostic tool used in the evaluation of patients with chronic diarrhea. Other evaluation strategies include timed stool collections, evaluation of inflammatory markers, and hydrogen breath tests. A focused workup of chronic diarrhea may yield a specific diagnosis, including diarrhea-predominant IBS (dIBS), functional diarrhea, diabetic diarrhea, bile acid-induced diarrhea, and microscopic colitis. Ideally, therapeutic decisions are specifically tailored to target the underlying pathophysiology, including, for example, gluten restriction for celiac disease, rotating antibiotics for small bowel bacterial overgrowth, budesonide therapy for collagenous colitis, and loperamide for treatment of functional diarrhea. It is also important to assess the role of diet and medications in chronic diarrhea. However, if no specific causes are identified following workup, empiric therapy with simple opiate antidiarrheals such as loperamide may be effective. If this proves unsuccessful, the use of more potent agents, including codeine and opium, may be considered.},

The aims of this study were first to determine whether the efficacy of this dietary change is due to dietary fructose restriction and second to define whether symptom relief was specific to free fructose or to poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates in general. METHODS: The double-blinded, randomized, quadruple arm, placebo-controlled rechallenge trial took place in the general community. The 25 patients who had responded to dietary change were provided all food, low in free fructose and fructans, for the duration of the study. Patients were randomly challenged by graded dose introduction of fructose, fructans, alone or in combination, or glucose taken as drinks with meals for maximum test period of 2 weeks, with at least 10-day washout period between. For the main outcome measures, symptoms were monitored by daily diary entries and responses to a global symptom question. RESULTS: Seventy percent of patients receiving fructose, 77% receiving fructans, and 79% receiving a mixture reported symptoms were not adequately controlled, compared with 14% receiving glucose (P < or = 0.002, McNemar test). Similarly, the severity of overall and individual symptoms was significantly and markedly less for glucose than other substances. Symptoms were induced in a dose-dependent manner and mimicked previous IBS symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IBS and fructose malabsorption, dietary restriction of fructose and/or fructans is likely to be responsible for symptomatic improvement, suggesting efficacy is due to restriction of poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates in general.},

AIM: To investigate the efficacy of a novel prebiotic trans-galactooligosaccharide in changing the colonic microflora and improve the symptoms in IBS sufferers. METHODS: In all, 44 patients with Rome II positive IBS completed a 12-week single centre parallel crossover controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive either 3.5 g/d prebiotic, 7 g/d prebiotic or 7 g/d placebo. IBS symptoms were monitored weekly and scored according to a 7-point Likert scale. Changes in faecal microflora, stool frequency and form (Bristol stool scale) subjective global assessment (SGA), anxiety and depression and QOL scores were also monitored. RESULTS: The prebiotic significantly enhanced faecal bifidobacteria (3.5 g/d P < 0.005; 7 g/d P < 0.001). Placebo was without effect on the clinical parameters monitored, while the prebiotic at 3.5 g/d significantly changed stool consistency (P < 0.05), improved flatulence (P < 0.05) bloating (P < 0.05), composite score of symptoms (P < 0.05) and SGA (P < 0.05). The prebiotic at 7 g/d significantly improved SGA (P < 0.05) and anxiety scores (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The galactooligosaccharide acted as a prebiotic in specifically stimulating gut bifidobacteria in IBS patients and is effective in alleviating symptoms. These findings suggest that the prebiotic has potential as a therapeutic agent in IBS.},

A colonic distension trial was performed with a barostat before and after a 1-hour duodenal lipid infusion (3 kcal/min). Colonic thresholds, colonic tone, and the viscerosomatic referral pattern were assessed and compared between groups. Patients also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. RESULTS: The reduction in colonic pressure thresholds after vs before duodenal lipids was greater in patients than in controls for discomfort (P = .006) and pain (P < .0001). An increased viscerosomatic referral area for pain and discomfort during colonic distensions after vs before duodenal lipids was observed in patients but not in controls. The response was similar in IBS subgroups based on the predominant bowel habit, in patients with vs without anxiety and/or depression, and in women and men with IBS. The colonic tone response during lipid infusion was similar in IBS patients and controls, and in the different IBS subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: IBS patients show increased colonic sensitivity and altered viscerosomatic referral pattern after duodenal lipids. This response is largely unaffected by the predominant bowel habit, psychologic factors, or sex, but seems to be related to IBS per se.},

Enhanced colorectal sensitivity after duodenal lipid administration in IBS patients has been demonstrated. However, the effects of a regular meal on colorectal sensitivity in these patients and the importance of the composition of the meal are not known. On two separate days, 10 IBS patients and 11 controls randomly received a liquid meal (800 kcal), containing 60% calories from fat (fatty meal) or carbohydrate (carbohydrate meal). Using a barostat rectal sensitivity was assessed during four separate distension sequences before, immediately after and 30 and 60 min after the meal. In the patients, the discomfort (P = 0.04) and the pain thresholds (P = 0.007) were gradually reduced after the fatty meal, whereas only a tendency in the same direction was seen after the carbohydrate meal. In patients VAS ratings for pain increased after the fatty meal (P = 0.03), but not after carbohydrates. In the controls, sensory thresholds were not affected by the meals. In IBS, a liquid meal enhances rectal sensitivity, and this seems to be partly nutrient dependent as a fatty meal has more pronounced effects than a carbohydrate meal. This might be of relevance for their postprandial symptoms.},

TDF gives the best estimate of fiber content in the diet. Whereas data on intake of crude fibers are available, there is a lack of data on intake of TDF in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIM: We assessed the TDF and its source in the diet of patients with IBS and healthy controls (HC). METHODS: Based on their predominant symptoms, 81 patients with IBS (according to Rome II criteria) were categorized into constipation-predominant (IBS-C, n=48), diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D, n=16) and mixed type (IBS-M, n=17). Information was collected on fiber supplementation and preference for high-fiber food. A pretested, open-ended, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to collect dietary information on food groups and TDF. Age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (n=89) were recruited as HC. The mean (SD) age of patients and HC was 36.5 (11.4) years (59 men), and 36 (12) years (62 men), respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (48%) were taking medicinal fiber supplements, of which 28 patients were taking supplements daily (2.10 [0.84] teaspoon full). The mean daily TDF intake was 51.7 (23.1) g vs. 52.3 (21.6) g for patients and HC, respectively (p=0.8). The intake of TDF was similar in patients having less (n=41) or more (n=40) preference for fiber-rich foods (55 [23] g vs. 47 [22] g, p=0.16). The daily mean cereal intake in patients was significantly lower than that in HC (322 g vs. 404 g, p=0.001). However, consumption of fruits (150 g vs. 80 g, p=0.001) and vegetables (348 g vs. 219 g, p=0.006) was higher in patients in comparison with HC. There was a positive correlation between TDF with cereals (p=0.001), pulses (p=0.001), vegetables and fruits (p=0.033) in patients with IBS but only with cereals (p=0.001) in HC. CONCLUSION: The intake of TDF in patients with IBS and HC is much higher than the dietary recommendation for healthy Indians. Patients with IBS consumed more fruits and vegetables rather than cereals as compared with HC.},

This intolerance could be related to an increase in colonic bacterial fermentation. The hydrogen breath test (HBT) is a marker of the intestinal micro flora fermentative capacity. AIM: To assess if there is an association between hydrogen (H2) levels and clinical changes between diets with and without bran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 10 women with predominantly constipated irritable bowel syndrome (Rome II criteria) received a lowfiber diet during one week. This phase was followed by a second 7 day period with the same diet but supplemented with 12 g of crude dietary fiber. At the end of both periods, patients completed a symptom scale (Lickert type) and performed a HBT. RESULTS: Comparing both periods with a different diet the median difference in the clinical scale score (-2.5) shows a tendency favorable to the diet without bran, p = 0.048. In the fiber period the median increase of 2 ppm in H2 values was not significant deferent. Neither was possible to establish an association between breath H2 and the clinical response to a fiber diet. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study we could not detect ary association between breath H2 levels and the clinical response to dietary fiber.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders, with a strong female predominance. When compared to the vast knowledge pertaining to adults with IBS, very little is known about IBS in the adolescent population. In Korea, the field of adolescent health with IBS is just beginning to develop, so there is still a lack of information concerning the prevalence of IBS in adolescent groups. OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to explore the prevalence of IBS among Korean adolescent girls, and identify the risk factors affecting IBS occurrence. DESIGN: This study adopted a cross-sectional descriptive design using the self-reported questionnaire. METHODS: A total of 405 adolescent females were recruited from 5 academic high schools in Korea in August and September of 2007. IBS was diagnosed based on the Rome II criteria. For the evaluation of risk factors on the IBS, we investigated dietary habit, life style, stress, anxiety, depression, and premenstrual syndrome (PMS). RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS according to Rome II criteria was 25.7% in the subjects. The multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that higher stress (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.13-4.48), anxiety (OR 4.27, 95% CI 1.09-16.71), and depression (OR 10.87, 95% CI 1.14-103.81) were independently associated with increased IBS occurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IBS in female adolescent students from this study was higher compared with those reported in the Western countries. This study provides much need information about the relatively unstudied Korean female adolescents in terms of IBS issues and aspects of psychological attributes to IBS. This study has the potential to influence the development of better promotion programs for adolescents and women's health.},

   abstract = {Serotonin is widely distributed throughout the gut within both the enteric nerves and enterochromaffin (EC) cells. EC cells are located in the gut mucosa with maximal numbers in the duodenum and rectum where they act as signal transducers, responding to pressure and luminal substances both bacterial and dietary. Activation leads to serotonin release which acts on a range of receptors on mucosal afferent and myenteric interneurones to initiate secretomotor reflexes. These cause nausea and vomiting as well as intestinal secretion, propulsion and if pronounced, diarrhoea. Inflammation in animal models acts via T lymphocytes to increase EC cell numbers and mucosal serotonin (5-HT) content while inflammatory cytokines decrease serotonin transporter (SERT) function. Inflammation due to coeliac disease and following gastrointestinal infection increases mucosal 5-HT availability by a combination of increased EC cells and depressed SERT. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) developing after gastrointestinal infection and IBS with diarrhoea is associated with excess 5-HT. The associated diarrhoeal symptoms respond well to 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. These drugs also inhibit the nausea and vomiting occurring in patients undergoing chemotherapy which cause a marked increase in release of 5-HT as well as other mediators. Other conditions including IBS-C and constipation may have inadequate 5-HT release and benefit from both 5-HT(3) and 5-HT(4) receptor agonists.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disease of unclear, complex pathophysiology characterised by abdominal pain and discomfort and altered bowel activity. It affects an estimated 10-15% of individuals worldwide and has a large impact on quality of life (QOL) and both direct and indirect healthcare costs. Symptoms of IBS are usually triggered by disruption of gastrointestinal (GI) function secondary to infection, dietary factors, lifestyle changes or psychological stress. While most currently available pharmacological treatments of IBS focus on symptomatic treatment of the syndrome, agents that attempt to address the pathophysiology of the disease, in particular the role of serotonin, have received much attention in recent years. However, there is growing concern that serotonergic agents as a class may be associated with rare, but serious, episodes of ischaemic colitis, with several cases of this complication having been reported in association with use of serotonergic agents that have reached the market. Thus, there remains an important need for safe and effective agents that treat the symptoms of IBS. Otilonium bromide, a spasmolytic agent, has been widely used worldwide and has been found to be effective and safe for managing abdominal pain. Clinical trials indicate that it improves baseline abdominal pain and distension, and is particularly effective in reducing diarrhoea. Combining otilonium bromide with benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, may improve the efficacy of the agent with respect to GI symptoms, while also treating underlying anxiety disorders. More research is required to confirm the efficacy and mechanisms of action associated with this combination therapy in IBS. Safety data from clinical trials and postmarketing sources indicate that otilonium bromide is well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable to placebo in clinical trials and only two reported cases of adverse reactions (urticaria) among 10-year postmarketing data. This article reviews the pathophysiology and treatment of IBS with a particular focus on the role of otilonium bromide in the management of this condition.},

   abstract = {Lubiprostone, a bicyclic fatty acid chloride channel activator, is efficacious in treatment of chronic constipation and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. The study aim was to compare effects of lubiprostone and placebo on colonic sensory and motor functions in humans. In double-blind, randomized fashion, 60 healthy adults received three oral doses of placebo or 24 microg lubiprostone per day in a parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. A barostat-manometry tube was placed in the left colon by flexible sigmoidoscopy and fluoroscopy. We measured treatment effects on colonic sensation and motility with validated methods, with the following end points: colonic compliance, fasting and postprandial tone and motility indexes, pain thresholds, and sensory ratings to distensions. Among participants receiving lubiprostone or placebo, 26 of 30 and 28 of 30, respectively, completed the study. There were no overall effects of lubiprostone on compliance, fasting tone, motility indexes, or sensation. However, there was a treatment-by-sex interaction effect for compliance (P = 0.02), with lubiprostone inducing decreased fasting compliance in women (P = 0.06) and an overall decreased colonic tone contraction after a standard meal relative to fasting tone (P = 0.014), with greater effect in women (P < 0.01). Numerical differences of first sensation and pain thresholds (P = 0.11 in women) in the two groups were not significant. We concluded that oral lubiprostone 24 microg does not increase colonic motor function. The findings of decreased colonic compliance and decreased postprandial colonic tone in women suggest that motor effects are unlikely to cause accelerated colonic transit with lubiprostone, although they may facilitate laxation. Effects of lubiprostone on sensitivity deserve further study.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stress and central corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) are contributing factors to the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It has been shown that restraint stress and central CRF stimulate colonic motility in rats. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced by bacterial fermentation from dietary fibers. It is controversial whether daily intake of dietary fiber is beneficial for patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. We studied whether dietary fiber intake affects colonic transit and motility stimulated by restraint stress and central CRF in rats. METHODS: Corn starch is digested almost completely in the small intestine, while potato starch shows substantial resistance to alpha-amylase and its consumption leads to stimulation of large-bowel fermentation. Four weeks after a corn starch, potato starch, or usual diet (rat chow), colonic transit and motility stimulated by restraint stress and intracisternal (ic) injection of CRF were studied. Fecal concentration of SCFAs in the cecum was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: Four-week treatment with potato starch diet significantly increased cecal concentrations of SCFAs, compared to treatment with corn starch diet. Accelerated colonic transit induced by stress and ic injection of CRF (1 microg) were significantly attenuated in rats receiving potato starch diet compared to rats receiving corn starch diet. The incidence of unformed stool (diarrhea) induced by stress and CRF was also reduced in rats receiving potato starch diet compared to rats receiving corn starch diet and usual diet. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that daily intake of a high-fiber diet may prevent stress- and CRF-induced acceleration of colonic transit and diarrhea. This study may contribute to treatment for the patients of diarrhea-predominant IBS.},

   abstract = {Whilst fruits and vegetables are an essential part of our dietary intake, the role of fiber in the prevention of colorectal diseases remains controversial. The main feature of a high-fiber diet is its poor digestibility. Soluble fiber like pectins, guar and ispaghula produce viscous solutions in the gastrointestinal tract delaying small bowel absorption and transit. Insoluble fiber, on the other hand, pass largely unaltered through the gut. The more fiber is ingested, the more stools will have to be passed. Fermentation in the intestines results in build up of large amounts of gases in the colon. This article reviews the physiology of ingestion of fiber and defecation. It also looks into the impact of dietary fiber on various colorectal diseases. A strong case cannot be made for a protective effect of dietary fiber against colorectal polyp or cancer. Neither has fiber been found to be useful in chronic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome. It is also not useful in the treatment of perianal conditions. The fiber deficit - diverticulosis theory should also be challenged. The authors urge clinicians to keep an open mind about fiber. One must be aware of the truths and myths about fiber before recommending it.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both coeliac disease and irritable bowel syndrome show impaired health-related quality of life, however, the impact of irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms on health-related quality of life in coeliac disease is unclear. AIM: To evaluate the effect of gluten-free diet adherence and irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms co-morbidity on health-related quality of life in adult coeliac disease patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1130 adults were enrolled in the study comprising 1001 controls from the general population and 129 diagnosed coeliac disease patients from the University Clinic in Cagliari. Irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms and health-related quality of life were assessed using the Rome II and the SF-36 questionnaires, respectively. RESULTS: Irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms prevalence in controls was 10.1% (102/1001) and 55% (71/129) in the coeliac disease patients. Irritable bowel syndrome-type symptom controls and coeliac disease patients both presented significantly lower health-related quality of life (p<or=0.05) compared to healthy controls. Strict diet coeliac disease patients, compared to partial diet patients, showed significantly (p<or=0.05) better scores in all domains, except physical functioning, physical-role and bodily pain. The lowest scores were found in partial diet coeliac disease patients with irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The present results confirm the burden of irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms and coeliac disease on health-related quality of life. Moreover, these data show that health-related quality of life in coeliac disease is impaired by poor compliance and by co-morbidity with irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms.},

   abstract = {GOALS: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of food hypersensitivity in Turkish patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). BACKGROUND: The IBS is a chronic disease of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by abdominal pain, distension, meteorism and either diarrhea or constipation. The role of diet in the pathogenesis of IBS remains controversial. Many investigators have shown that individual foods can trigger symptoms in some patients; nevertheless, the percentage of patients that benefit from dietary manipulation ranges from 15% to 67% in different reports. STUDY: Skin prick test to 11 common allergens, total IgE, eosinophilic cationic protein and eosinophil counts were evaluated in 100 patients satisfying the Rome II criteria and compared with 25 healthy controls. The history and physical examination of the groups were recorded and Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories were performed. RESULTS: One hundred patients were entered into the study with a mean age of 45.63+/-12.91 years. Of the patients 53 had constipation predominant, 19 had diarrhea predominant, and 28 had alternating type IBS. Skin prick tests positivity were more common among the IBS patients in comparison with controls (25% and 1%, respectively, P<0.05). Mean IgE values were higher in patients than controls (70.83+/-66.05 and 15.20+/-14.01 IU/mL, respectively, P<0.000). Eosinophilic cationic protein values were also higher in IBS patients than controls (16.75+/-11.28 and 11.56+/-4.72, respectively, P<0.05) Evaluation of Beck Depression Inventory showed that tendency to depression in patients with IBS was 38% and 4% in controls (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, in patients complaining of IBS it is of importance to search for a food component. Clinical improvements can be observed after the introduction of an adequate exclusion diet.},

   abstract = {Motor and sensory dysfunction of the gut are present in a subset of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of a recto-colonic inhibitory reflex in healthy humans. It is not known whether this reflex exists in IBS. We studied rectal compliance, perception and the recto-colonic reflex by measuring volume responses of the descending colon to rectal distentions by barostat in 26 IBS patients and 13 healthy controls under both fasting and postprandial conditions. In the fasting state, rectal distention inhibited colonic tone and phasic motility to a similar extent in health and IBS. After a meal, rectal distention inhibited colonic tone and phasic motility to a lesser degree (P < 0.05) in IBS than health. Under postprandial but not fasting conditions, rectal distentions of increasing intensity were associated with higher pain scores in IBS than in health. Rectal distention inhibits tonic and phasic motility of the descending colon in healthy controls and in IBS patients. Postprandially this recto-colonic inhibitory reflex is impaired and attenuated in IBS patients compared with controls. These findings point to an altered reflex function in IBS and have implications for pathophysiology and therapy.},

   abstract = {The gut contains a diverse bacterial flora that is acquired at birth and has a number of physiological functions. Administration of prebiotics or probiotics may favourably alter this gut microflora. Prebiotics are poorly digested oligosaccharides that promote the growth of desirable bacteria and may have other beneficial gastrointestinal and systemic effects. Probiotics are "helpful" human bacteria that provide a variety of health benefits when administered exogenously. Probiotics produce beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of traveller's diarrhoea, viral diarrhoea, and diarrhoea in day care centres. Moreover, probiotics have been shown to reduce relapses associated with Clostridium difficile, and Lactobacilli are effective in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Probiotics may also be efficacious in the treatment of gastroenteritis. Clinical studies of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease have proved disappointing, but beneficial effects in adults with irritable bowel syndrome have been reported with Bifidobacterium infantis 35624. Lactobacilli GG reduces the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms and gut permeability in patients with atopic dermatitis, and administration of probiotics reduces the frequency and severity of atopic eczema when administered to pregnant women and then to newborn infants. In conclusion, probiotics are effective in the treatment and/or prevention of a number of conditions, including diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome and atopic dermatitis, and the product used should be selected based on the particular indication.},

   abstract = {The present report describes a young woman with no previous gastrointestinal complaints who was initially diagnosed with postinfective irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) after a confirmed case of Campylobacter jejuni enteritis. However, because of persistent diarrhea, new-onset bloating and the development of iron and vitamin deficiencies, serological markers for celiac disease (CD) were evaluated. A positive tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A antibody test and repeat endoscopy with duodenal biopsy showing a Marsh IIIa lesion confirmed the diagnosis of CD. Infectious gastroenteritis is a well-established risk factor for the development of IBS, and there is recent evidence that it could play a role in the initiation and exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. The present case suggests that the clinical expression of CD can be unmasked by an acute gastrointestinal infection and supports the hypothesis that environmental factors other than gliadin may play a role in the clinical onset of CD in a genetically susceptible host. The increasing availability of serological testing and upper endoscopy has led to increasingly frequent diagnoses of CD and recognition that it may mimic IBS. The present case findings suggest that CD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of persistent IBS-like symptoms after an episode of infectious gastroenteritis.},

A substantial proportion of patients continues to experience long-lasting symptoms. Gut-directed hypnotherapy (HT) has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of adult IBS patients. We undertook a randomized controlled trial and compared clinical effectiveness of HT with standard medical therapy (SMT) in children with FAP or IBS. METHODS: Fifty-three pediatric patients, age 8-18 years, with FAP (n = 31) or IBS (n = 22), were randomized to either HT or SMT. Hypnotherapy consisted of 6 sessions over a 3-month period. Patients in the SMT group received standard medical care and 6 sessions of supportive therapy. Pain intensity, pain frequency, and associated symptoms were scored in weekly standardized abdominal pain diaries at baseline, during therapy, and 6 and 12 months after therapy. RESULTS: Pain scores decreased significantly in both groups: from baseline to 1 year follow-up, pain intensity scores decreased in the HT group from 13.5 to 1.3 and in the SMT group from 14.1 to 8.0. Pain frequency scores decreased from 13.5 to 1.1 in the HT group and from 14.4 to 9.3 in the SMT group. Hypnotherapy was highly superior, with a significantly greater reduction in pain scores compared with SMT (P < .001). At 1 year follow-up, successful treatment was accomplished in 85% of the HT group and 25% of the SMT group (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Gut-directed HT is highly effective in the treatment of children with longstanding FAP or IBS.},

Both are diseases and not only a kind of discomfort. The high frequency of dispepsia and irritable bowel syndrome induces very high direct and indirect charges. Both diseases depend on a number of factors or causes, for whom the evidence is not good. But there are good experimental data for the visceral hypersensitivity as one of the main factors. Gastroscopy is the most important examination in the diagnosis of dyspepsia. Endoscopy has to be done in all patients with alarm symptoms an in all patients older than 45 years. The therapy of dyspepsia is an empirical one. The eradication of Helicobacter pylori is a therapeutical option, but only 8% of the patients will have benefit for a long time. Other therapeutical options are the use of proton-pump inhibitors, prokinetics or phytotherapeutics. The therapy of the irritable bowel syndrome depends on the subtype of the disease (diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, bloating). First of all a good doctor-patient relationship is mandatory. Furthermore the use of dietary fibre, antidiarrhoeics, laxatives and muscle relaxants may be beneficial. And phytotherapeutics can be an additional therapeutic approach.},

However, data from dietary elimination and re-challenge studies are inconclusive. Although investigations have shown that bran may be helpful in some patients, a complete review of the literature does not reveal conclusive evidence that a high fibre diet therapy is effective in IBS. From the limited reports on probiotics, there appears to be a trend to decreasing symptoms. Despite numerous reviews on this subject, it is very difficult to give general dietary advice to IBS patients, but dietary experts may have a positive role in managing such patients. It is clear that much more prospective research is needed to study both dietary factors and probiotics in these areas.},

We examined the prevalence of celiac disease-associated serum antibodies in diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome (d-IBS) patients and their efficacy in combination with HLA-DQ2 expression to predict the response to gluten-free diet. METHODS: HLA-DQA1*0501/DQB1*0201 expression and celiac disease-associated IgA and IgG serum antibodies against gliadin and tissue-transglutaminase were measured in 145 patients with d-IBS, 74 patients with untreated and treated celiac disease, and 57 patients with active IBD. Follow-up antibody levels, stool frequency, and gastrointestinal symptom scores were determined in 41 d-IBS patients (26 women, 15 men; median age, 46 years, range, 30-67 years) who participated in a nonrandomized evaluation of 6 months of gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Increased celiac disease-associated serum IgG, but not IgA, was found in the majority of patients with treated (55%) as in most patients with untreated celiac disease (97%). In d-IBS patients, celiac disease-associated serum IgG antibodies (37%) and HLA-DQ2 expression (39%) were more frequent than in IBD patients (18% and 23%, respectively). After 6 months of gluten-free diet, stool frequency and gastrointestinal symptom score returned to normal values in 60% of d-IBS patients who were positive and in 12% who were negative for HLA-DQ2 and celiac disease-associated serum IgG; both parameters combined yielded positive and negative predictive values of 56% (95% confidence interval, 30%-80%) and 88% (69%-97%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease-associated serum IgG and HLA-DQ2 expression can identify likely responders to gluten-free diet in d-IBS patients.},

This review will address the evidence for alternative therapies, including the following: cognitive behavior therapy, hypnosis, elimination diets based on food antibody testing, nutrition supplements (such as fiber, probiotics, and prebiotics), and, finally, peppermint, l-glutamine, zinc, and cromolyn sodium. The review also explores the evidence for and the therapeutic ramifications of the hypothesis that increased intestinal permeability underlies the symptoms of IBS in many patients, and how a therapeutic plan that addresses nutrition, elimination diets, and nutrition supplements may be useful in restoring the integrity of the gut immune barrier.},

   abstract = {The enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract secrete 400 times as much melatonin as the pineal gland; therefore, it is not surprising that research is finding that this indole plays an important role in GI functioning. In animal studies, it protects against GI ulcerations, and randomized clinical trials suggest its efficacy in treating functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. Melatonin administration has been shown to protect against esophageal lesions in animals. Moreover, in a randomized, single-blind clinical trial of subjects with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the combination of melatonin with other natural supplements was found to be superior to omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Its administration as a single treatment for GERD has not been previously reported. A 64-year-old Caucasian female who required treatment with a PPI for symptoms of GERD wished to substitute a natural treatment because of the risk of worsening her osteoporosis. She experienced a return of symptoms following each of three 20-day trials of a proprietary blend of D-limonene when attempts were made to discontinue the PPI. She then underwent a trial of a natural formula consisting of melatonin 6 mg, 5-hydroxytryptophan 100 mg, D,L-methionine 500 mg, betaine 100 mg, L-taurine 50 mg, riboflavin 1.7 mg, vitamin B6 0.8 mg, folic acid 400 microg, and calcium 50 mg. After 40 days, the PPI was withdrawn without a return of symptoms. Subsequently, an attempt to reduce melatonin to 3 mg resulted in symptoms, while all other ingredients were withdrawn with minimal symptoms during 10 months of follow-up.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the therapeutic effects on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by eliminating the allergic foods according to food-specific IgG antibodies and to clarify the etiopathological role and mechanism of food allergy. METHODS: The food-specific IgG antibodies to a panel of 14 different food antigens in serum were detected with ELISA in fifty five cases with diarrhea-dominant IBS, thirty two with constipation-dominant IBS and eighteen normal controls. The frequency and severity index of symptoms and scores of Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) in thirty five cases with positive food-specific IgG were observed before and after elimination of allergic foods for two months. RESULTS: The positive rate of serum food-specific IgG antibodies was 63.6 percent in patients with diarrhea-dominant IBS and 43.8 percent in constipation-dominant IBS. Both were higher than that in normal controls. After eliminating allergic foods for four weeks according to the levels of serum food-specific IgG antibodies, the frequency of symptoms decreased from (3.79 +/- 1.58) to (1.67 +/- 0.70) per week and the severity from 3.18 +/- 1.46 to 1.52 +/- 0.67 with significant differences. After eight weeks, the frequency of symptoms decreased from (3.79 +/- 1.58) to (1.53 +/- 0.69) per week and the severity from 3.18 +/- 1.46 to 1.45 +/- 0.66, also with significant differences. After eliminating allergic foods, the overall health score and the eight dimensionality integrals of QOL except avoiding food in patients with IBS increased significantly than those before treatment. At the end of eight weeks, the symptoms relieved completely in 31.4 percent of the cases and remarkably in 34.3 percent. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal immune reactions mediated by IgG antibodies coexisted in patients with IBS. It is of great significance in treating IBS by eliminating the allergic foods according to the serum level of food-specific IgG antibodies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The intestinal permeability is increased in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). AIM: To determine the possible efficacy of lactic acid bacteria on the increased intestinal permeability in D-IBS. METHODS: Treatment was employed for 4 weeks in a randomized single blind placebo controlled study with 30 D-IBS patients. Patients were given either probiotic fermented milk (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium Longum) or milk beverage containing no bacteria. The clinical symptoms were scored and intestinal permeability was measured by a triple sugar test before and after treatment. RESULTS: Small bowel permeability was measured as the ratio of lactulose and mannitol recovery and colonic permeability was measured as the total mass of sucralose excretion (mg). After probiotics treatment, small bowel permeability decreased significantly from 0.038 (0.024) at baseline to 0.023 (0.020) (P = 0.004), the proportion of patients with increased small bowel permeability was lower than baseline (28.6% vs. 64.3%, P = 0.023). However, colonic permeability improved neither in the probiotics group nor in the placebo group at week 4. Treatment with probiotics significantly decreased the mean global IBS scores compared with the baseline scores (9.62 +/- 1.05 vs. 7.64 +/- 1.24, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Short-term active lactic acid bacteria treatment for D-IBS improved mucosal barrier function.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: The purpose of the present paper was to investigate the effects of cold water intake on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (d-IBS) patients, and to observe the relationship between 5-HT and symptomatology. METHODS: The plasma 5-HT/5-HIAA concentrations at 0, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, 150 min and 180 min following cold or warm water intake were investigated in 32 female subjects with d-IBS and 21 healthy female subjects. Gastric mucosal 5-HT under fasting conditions and following water intake were further investigated in 15 d-IBS patients and nine healthy subjects. Symptomatology was assessed throughout the study. RESULTS: The plasma 5-HT concentrations in IBS patients were significantly higher than those of controls at 30 min (P = 0.022), 60 min (P < 0.001), 90 min (P < 0.001), 120 min (P < 0.001) and 150 min (P = 0.001) after cold water intake. The peak plasma 5-HT/5-HIAA and area under the curve for 5-HT/5-HIAA were also higher in d-IBS patients (P < 0.001). Gastric mucosal 5-HT in d-IBS patients and controls did not show any significant differences both under fasting condition (P = 0.596) and after cold water intake (P = 0.426). Last, the d-IBS patients with symptoms had higher 5-HT concentration (P < 0.001) and there was a positive correlation (r = 0.714, P = 0.001)between the symptomatology and plasma 5-HT level. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that symptomatology following cold water intake may be associated with increased plasma 5-HT concentrations in female subjects with d-IBS.},

   abstract = {Functional dyspepsia belongs to functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Its prevalence is estimated up to 25% of adult population of Western countries. On the contrary to irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia is slightly more frequent in men. The recent classification of functional dyspepsia includes its two subcategories: postprandial distress syndrome (DS, B1a) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS, B1b). In the management of functional dyspepsia three strategies are taken into the consideration: 1. early gastroscopy performed in people over 45 years of age and independent of age in case of alarm symptoms. 2. Therapy based on noninvasive H. pylori testing: in young adults with dyspeptic symptoms, without alarm symptoms and not treated with nonsteroid antiphlogistic medications. 3. Empiric treatment: considered as an initial therapy in patients not diagnosed with dyspepsia, without alarm symptoms and in dyspeptic patients despite H. pylori eradication. In the treatment of functional dyspepsia the following treatments are applied: dietary treatment, farmacotherapy with antisecretory drugs, prokinetics, H. pylori eradication, antidepressants and psychotherapy. Directions of the further investigation in functional dyspepsia include: improvement of endoscopic methods, and searching for new groups of medications according to the new Rome III classification of functional dyspepsia, based on its pathophysiology.},
