   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fermented milk (FM) containing Bifidobacterium lactis CNCM I-2494 and yogurt strains improves irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in constipated IBS patients. In rats, stressful events exacerbate IBS symptoms and result in the alteration of gut sensitivity and permeability via epithelial cell cytoskeleton contraction. In a stress model, we aimed at evaluating the effect of B. lactis CNCM I-2494 as a pure strain or contained in an FM product on visceral sensitivity and the impact of this FM on intestinal barrier integrity. METHODS: Visceral sensitivity was analyzed in rats subjected to partial restraint stress (PRS). Rats received during 15 days the B. lactis as a pure strain (10(6) to 10(10) CFU mL(-1)), B. lactis in an FM product (10(8) CFU g(-1), diluted or not), or a control product. Gut paracellular permeability, colonic occluding and Jam-A proteins, and blood endotoxin levels were determined in rats receiving B. lactis in an FM product submitted or not to a PRS. KEY RESULTS: The FM product showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity. A similar antihyperalgesic effect was observed at 10(10) CFU mL(-1) of pure B. lactis administration. The FM product prevented the increase in intestinal permeability induced by PRS and restored occludin and JAM-A expressions to control levels. The FM product abolished the increase concentration of blood endotoxin induced by PRS. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: This study illustrates that a probiotic food containing B. lactis CNCM I-2494 strain reduces visceral hypersensitivity associated with acute stress by normalizing intestinal epithelial barrier via a synergistic interplay with the different probiotic strains and/or metabolites contained in this product.},

For psychological treatment options, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, gut-directed hypnotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy, the evidence supporting their use in IBS patients is strong, but the availability limits their use in clinical practice. Dietary interventions are commonly included in the management of IBS patients, but these are primarily based on studies assessing physiological function in relation to dietary components, and to a lesser degree upon research examining the role of dietary components in the therapeutic management of IBS. Several probiotic products improve a range of symptoms in IBS patients. Physical activity is of benefit for health in general and recent data implicates its usefulness also for IBS patients. Acupuncture does not seem to have an effect beyond placebo in IBS. A beneficial effect of some herbal treatments has been reported.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The human gastrointestinal lumen is inhabited by a wide variety of microbiota. Our understanding of the intestinal microbiota and its full consequences on gastrointestinal health is still evolving. However, it is well accepted that altered colonic flora drives the pathogenesis of many disorders and diseases as seen in antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile infection. Recent works published in the area of probiotics are reviewed here. RECENT FINDINGS: Alterations in colonic microbiota, or dysbiosis, are now implicated in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel diseases. Probiotics and prebiotics are evolving treatment options that are targeted at restoring nonpathogenic digestive flora. There has been great interest in the role of these therapies in treatment of many diseases including childhood diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. SUMMARY: Trials of probiotics have been shown to be helpful in some of these, not in others, and more work is needed in others. We review recent work done in these areas.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food and diet are central issues that concern patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Few studies have thoroughly analyzed dietary intake in IBS. Our aims were to determine the nutrient intake in IBS patients in comparison to the general population, assess nutritional differences between IBS subgroups based on the predominant bowel habit or symptom severity, as well as to evaluate if their nutrient intake meet nutrition recommendations. METHODS: We included 187 IBS patients (mean 40.2 years; 139 women). They completed a 4-days food registration record, which was compared with an age-, and gender-matched control group (n = 374; 278 women) from a nation-wide dietary survey and with Nordic Nutrient Recommendations. KEY RESULTS: Daily nutrient intake in IBS patients was similar to the general population and met national nutrients recommendations. Irritable bowel syndrome patients had similar energy distribution from macronutrients compared to the control group, but the protein percentage tended to be higher. Irritable bowel syndrome patients also had significantly higher daily intake of vitamin E, folate, iron, vitamin C, and dietary fibers, as well as lower intake of vitamin A, riboflavin, calcium, and potassium. There was no association between nutrient intake and IBS subtypes or symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Although many IBS patients state that they avoid food items, this does not seem to influence their intake of nutrients to any large extent. The observed minor differences in nutrient intake indicate a tendency toward higher intake of fruit and vegetables and a lower intake of meat and dairy products in IBS patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The possible effect of obesity in the outcome of treated children with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) has not yet been studied. We hypothesized that obesity is associated with a poor long-term prognosis in children with FGIDs. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study in an outpatient clinic-based sample of patients diagnosed with abdominal pain-related FGIDs. Principal outcome measured was persistence of pain at long-term follow-up (12-15 months). Frequency of pain, intensity of pain, school absenteeism and disruption of daily activities were compared between obese and non-obese subjects. RESULTS: The group mean age was 13.27+/-3.84 years, distribution of diagnosis was 32% (functional abdominal pain), 42.5% (irritable bowel syndrome) and 25.5% (functional dyspepsia). Overall, 20.2% of patients were obese. A total of 116 patients (61.7%) reported abdominal pain and 72 (38.3%) were asymptomatic at long-term follow-up. Obese patients were more likely to have abdominal pain (P<0.0001), higher intensity of pain (P=0.0002), higher frequency of pain (P=0.0032), school absenteeism (P<0.0001) and disruption of daily activities (P<0.0001) at follow-up than non-obese patients. CONCLUSION: Obesity is associated with poor outcome and disability at long-term follow-up in children with abdominal pain-related FGIDs. Our novel findings could have important implications in the prognosis and management of FGIDs.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will be discussed.},

The Life Sciences Research Organization, Inc. (LSRO) held a workshop, Prebiotics and the Health Benefits of Fiber: Future Research and Goals, in February 2011 to assess the current state of the science and the international regulatory environment for prebiotics, identify research gaps, and create a strategy for future research. A developing body of evidence supports a role for prebiotics in reducing the risk and severity of GI infection and inflammation, including diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, and ulcerative colitis as well as bowel function disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics also increase the bioavailability and uptake of minerals and data suggest that they reduce the risk of obesity by promoting satiety and weight loss. Additional research is needed to define the relationship between the consumption of different prebiotics and improvement of human health. New information derived from the characterization of the composition and function of different prebiotics as well as the interactions among and between gut microbiota and the human host would improve our understanding of the effects of prebiotics on health and disease and could assist in surmounting regulatory issues related to prebiotic use.},

The aim of the study was to establish the frequency and nature of reproductive function violation in patients with CD in the Russian Federation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 132 women (average age 38,5 +/- 1,17 years) with CD observed in CSRIG in the period from 2000 to 2010. Comparison group consisted 105 women (average age 38,7 +/- 1,6 years) with predominantly functional bowel disorders (irritable bowel syndrome, functional constipation, functional bloating, inert colon). Were took into account information regarding obstetric history, physical and laboratory signs of malabsorption syndrome (MS) study of antibodies to alpha-gliadin immunoglobulin (IG) A class (AGA) and tissue transglutaminase (AtTG). RESULTS: The average age of onset of menses was 14,3 +/- 1,4 years, and in the control group - 13,0 +/- 1,3 years (p > 0.05), half of patients with C (43.9%) had menstruation begun at age 15 years and older, while 7.6% of the women--aged 17 and older. In the comparison group menses beginning after 15 years was only at 13.3% of women. In 61.3% of patients with CD was irregular menstrual cycle while in the comparison group such violations were noted in 13.3% (p < 0.001). Prolonged periods of amenorrhea we observed in women with newly diagnosed GC 3 times more likely than the comparison group: 43.9% and 11.4% respectively (p < 0.01). They also had nearly 3 times more likely to occur spontaneous miscarriage: at 46.9% and 14.3% respectively (p < 0.01). The frequency of dead children birth was about the same: 2.3% and 1.9% respectively (p > 0.05). The frequency of reproductive disorders increased with the growth of the severity of MS. In 43% of women after 6-8 months of strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) had disappeared amenorrhea and there were regular menses. Three women of childbearing age, strictly abided the GFD and had a history of repeated spontaneous abortion during the year managed to get pregnant and give birth to healthy full-term baby. CONCLUSIONS: Reproductive disorders in women with celiac disease are significantly more likely than at women with functional bowel disease. One of the reasons of reproductive disorders in patients with CD can be malabsorption of necessary nutrients in the small intestine. The presence of reproductive disorders should be considered as a risk factor for celiac disease, so these women should be screened for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pain contains both sensory and affective dimensions. Using a rodent visceral pain assay that combines the colorectal distension (CRD) model with the conditioned place avoidance (CPA) paradigms, we measured a learned behavior that directly reflects the affective component of visceral pain, and showed that perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) activation is critical for memory processing involved in long-term visceral affective state and prediction of aversive stimuli by contextual cue. Progress has been made and suggested that activation of vagal afferents plays a role in the behavioral control nociception and memory storage processes.In human patients, electrical vagus nerve stimulation enhanced retention of verbal learning performance. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK), which is a gastrointestinal hormone released during feeding, has been shown to enhance memory retention. Mice access to food immediately after training session enhanced memory retention. It has been well demonstrated that CCK acting on vagal afferent fibers mediates various physiological functions. We hypothesize that CCK activation of vagal afferent enhances visceral pain-related affective memory. RESULTS: In the presented study, infusion of CCK-8 at physiological concentration combining with conditional training significantly increased the CRD-induced CPA scores, and enhanced the pain affective memory retention. In contrast, CCK had no effect on CPA induced by non-nociceptive aversive stimulus (U69,593). The physiological implications were further strengthened by the similar effects observed in the rats with duodenal infusion of 5% peptone, which has been shown to induce increases in plasma CCK levels. CCK-8 receptor antagonist CR-1409 or perivagal application of capsaicin abolished the effect of CCK on aversive visceral pain memory, which was consistent with the notion that vagal afferent modulates affective aspects of visceral pain. CCK does not change the nociceptive response (visceral pain sensitivity) and anterior cingulate cortex neuronal responses to CRD. CONCLUSION: CCK activating vagal afferent C fibers enhances memory consolidation and retention involved in long-term visceral negative affective state. Thus, in a number of gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, nutrient content may contribute to painful visceral perception by enhancing visceral aversive memory via acts on vagal afferent pathway.},

   abstract = {Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) are a group of disorders of the digestive system in which the chronic or recurrent symptoms cannot be explained by the presence of structural or tissue abnormality. This survey used a modified Rome III questionnaire on the health and nutrition status of a general population in Taiwan during 2005-2008. A total of 4,275 responders completed the questionnaire. The sample was evenly distributed for men (n=2,137) and women (n=2,138). The prevalence of FGID was 26.2%. Unspecified functional bowel disorder was the most prevalent (8.9%). The second was functional dyspepsia (5.3%), and the third were irritable bowel syndrome (4.4%) and functional constipation (4.4%). Women had a greater prevalence than males (33.2% compared to 22.4%, p<0.05) with regards to total FGID. Most categories of FGID were significantly prominent in women, except functional diarrhea. The FGID groups took fewer servings of vegetables and fruits than the non-FGID group each day (vegetables 2.51 vs 2.70, p<0.001; fruits 0.82 vs 0.91, p<0.001). Smoking, alcohol consumption, and betel nut chewing had no significant impaction on prevalence of FGID. The mean BSRS (brief-symptom rating scale) for screening depression and suicide ideation was higher in the FGID group (2.86 vs 1.63, p<0.001). In conclusion, FGID diagnosed with Rome III criteria are not uncommon in Taiwan's general population. Subjects who met the Rome III criteria for FGID in Taiwan were younger, had less vegetables and fruits intake, higher BSRS scores and were of greater female predominance.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Most studies on probiotics utilise single strains, sometimes incorporated into yoghurts. There are fewer studies on efficacy of mixtures of probiotic strains. This review examines the evidence that (a) probiotic mixtures are beneficial for a range of health-related outcomes and (b) mixtures are more or less effective than their component strains administered separately. RESULTS: Mixtures of probiotics had beneficial effects on the end points including irritable bowel syndrome and gut function, diarrhoea, atopic disease, immune function and respiratory tract infections, gut microbiota modulation, inflammatory bowel disease and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. However, only 16 studies compared the effect of a mixture with that of its component strains separately, although in 12 cases (75%), the mixture was more effective. CONCLUSION: Probiotic mixtures appear to be effective against a wide range of end points. Based on a limited number of studies, multi-strain probiotics appear to show greater efficacy than single strains, including strains that are components of the mixtures themselves. However, whether this is due to synergistic interactions between strains or a consequence of the higher probiotic dose used in some studies is at present unclear.},

In this review, evidence on the effectiveness of psyllium supplementation for diagnosed IBS symptoms was evaluated and summarized. A systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science was conducted. Included were full-length, peer-reviewed, English-language articles in which psyllium ingestion was tested for its effect on IBS symptoms. Quality of these articles also was assessed. Twelve met the criteria for complete data abstraction. Seventy-five percent of the studies examined were of weak quality. Study designs and methods were heterogeneous. Patient-perceived global symptoms improved significantly in six of the nine studies measuring a global symptom outcome. In one study, significant improvements occurred in reported abdominal pain; in three, improvement did not occur. Quality of life and flatulence did not improve significantly in any studies in which these outcomes were examined. The results of this systematic review indicate limited and conflicting evidence to support the recommendation of psyllium supplementation for symptomatic IBS treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Manipulation of dietary fibre intake represents a longstanding treatment for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), particularly for those with constipation. Linseeds are often recommended by both clinicians and dietitians as a source of dietary fibre to alleviate symptoms. Recent guidance on the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) advises that linseeds may reduce wind and bloating, although there is limited clinical evidence to support this recommendation. The present pilot study aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of: (i) whole linseeds versus ground linseeds; (ii) whole linseeds versus no linseeds; and (iii) ground linseeds versus no linseeds in the management of IBS symptoms. METHODS: In an open randomised controlled trial, subjects with IBS (n = 40) were allocated to one of three intervention groups: two tablespoons of whole linseeds per day (n = 14), two tablespoons of ground linseeds per day (n = 13) and no linseeds as controls (n = 13). Symptom severity (primary outcome) and bowel habit were assessed before and after a 4-week intervention and statistical differences between the groups were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects completed the present study. Between-group analysis comparing the improvement in symptom severity did not reach statistical significance for whole linseeds (n = 11) versus ground linseeds (n = 11; P = 0.62), whole linseeds versus controls (n = 9; P = 0.12) and ground linseeds versus controls (P = 0.10). There were no significant changes in stool frequency or stool consistency for any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Linseeds may be useful in relief of IBS symptoms. Further research is needed to detect clear differences between the effects of whole and ground linseeds.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic abdominal pain (CAP) in children may be a precursor to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adults. The prevalence of abnormal lactulose breath tests (LBT) suggesting small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been reported as 91% in children with CAP and 35% in healthy controls. In addition, patients with IBS with SIBO who responded to nonabsorbable antibiotic treatment with normalization of LBT reported 75% global improvement in symptoms. The aim of the study was to test whether treatment with a nonabsorbable antibiotic may reduce symptoms in children with CAP. METHODS: Seventy-five children ages 8 to 18 years with CAP based on Rome II criteria were enrolled. Subjects underwent baseline LBT and completed symptom-based questionnaires. They were then randomized in a 2:1, double-blind fashion to receive a 10-day course of 550 mg of rifaximin or placebo 3 times per day (t.i.d.). LBT and questionnaires were repeated 2 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: Forty-nine children received rifaximin and 26 received placebo. There were no differences in demographics between groups. Ninety-four percent who received rifaximin and 92% who received placebo had abnormal baseline LBT, suggesting SIBO (not significant [NS]). There was no significant difference in symptom improvement between groups; however, only 20% of children treated with rifaximin achieved a normalized repeat LBT, demonstrating successful treatment of SIBO. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to adults with IBS, the prevalence of abnormal LBT suggesting SIBO in children with CAP is high; however, treatment with 10 days of rifaximin has low efficacy in normalizing LBT in this group. Additional studies are needed to determine whether a treatment approach with higher efficacy would lead to improvement in children with CAP.},

   abstract = {Human biology can only be fully assessed by combining an analysis of both the host and its surrounding environment. As a part of the environment, the human gastrointestinal tract hosts more than 100 trillion bacteria making up the gut microbiota. The human host provides a nutrient-rich environment while the microbiota provides indispensable functions that humans cannot exert themselves. Shifts in the bacterial makeup of the human gut microbiota have been associated with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome and obesity. However, since most bacteria inhabiting our gut are not cultivable to date, until recently little was known about their individual functions. Metagenomics, i.e. the analysis of the collective genomes present in a defined ecosystem, gives insight into these specific functions. The first extensive catalogue of the intestinal metagenome outnumbers the size of the human genome by a factor of 150. Recently, 3 distinct 'types' of gut composition within the human population have been highlighted. These so-called 'enterotypes' are characterized by the dominant genera (Bacteroides, Prevotella and Ruminococcus) and their co-occurring phylogenetic groups. In accordance with the previously described impact of nutritional behavior (diet, probiotics and prebiotics) on specific bacterial populations, an association has been observed between long-term dietary habits and enterotypes. This recent discovery, i.e. that belonging to one or the other enterotype might be modulated by the diet opens up new perspectives in the fields of IBD, nutrition and therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGD) are common among children, but little is known regarding their prevalence in developing countries. We assessed the prevalence of abdominal pain-predominant FGD, in addition to the predisposing factors and symptomatology, in Sri Lankan children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a randomly selected group of 10- to 16-year-olds in 8 randomly selected schools in 4 provinces in Sri Lanka. A validated, self-administered questionnaire was completed by children independently in an examination setting. FGD were diagnosed using Rome III criteria. RESULTS: A total of 2180 questionnaires were distributed and 2163 (99.2%) were included in the analysis (1189 [55%] boys, mean age 13.4 years, standard deviation 1.8 years). Of them, 270 (12.5%) had at least 1 abdominal pain-predominant FGD. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was seen in 107 (4.9%), functional dyspepsia in 54 (2.5%), functional abdominal pain in 96 (4.4%), and abdominal migraine (AM) in 21 (1.0%) (2 had AM and functional dyspepsia, 6 had AM and IBS). Extraintestinal symptoms were more common among affected children (P < 0.05). Abdominal pain-predominant FGD were higher in girls and those exposed to stressful events (P < 0.05). Prevalence negatively correlated with age (r = -0.05, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal pain-predominant FGD affects 12.5% of children ages 10 to 16 years and constitutes a significant health problem in Sri Lanka. IBS is the most common FGD subtype present. Abdominal pain-predominant FGD are higher in girls and those exposed to emotional stress. Prevalence of FGD decreased with age. Extraintestinal symptoms are more frequent in affected children.},

   abstract = {Inflammation is a hot topic in medical research, because it plays a key role in inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other forms of arthritis, diabetes, heart diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, allergies, asthma, even cancer and many others. Over the past few decades, it was realized that the process of inflammation is virtually the same in different disorders, and a better understanding of inflammation may lead to better treatments for numerous diseases. Inflammation is the activation of the immune system in response to infection, irritation, or injury, with an influx of white blood cells, redness, heat, swelling, pain, and dysfunction of the organs involved. Although the pathophysiological basis of these conditions is not yet fully understood, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have often been implicated in their pathogenesis. In fact, in inflammatory diseases the antioxidant defense system is compromised, as evidenced by increased markers of oxidative stress, and decreased levels of protective antioxidant enzymes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An enriched diet containing antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-carotene and phenolic substances, has been suggested to improve symptoms by reducing disease-related oxidative stress. In this respect, the marine world represents a largely untapped reserve of bioactive ingredients, and considerable potential exists for exploitation of these bioactives as functional food ingredients. Substances such as n-3 oils, carotenoids, vitamins, minerals and peptides provide a myriad of health benefits, including reduction of cardiovascular diseases, anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. New marine bioactives are recently gaining attention, since they could be helpful in combating chronic inflammatory degenerative conditions. The aim of this review is to examine the published studies concerning the potential pharmacological properties and application of many marine bioactives against inflammatory diseases.},

   abstract = {Probiotic lactic acid bacteria have been reported to alleviate symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. However, they have not been tested for use in functional gastric disease. We therefore investigated if strains previously shown to protect from response to colorectal distension (CRD) in rats also modulate response to gastric distension (GD). Healthy, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with viable, heat-killed, gamma-irradiated Lactobacillus reuteri or viable Lactobacillus plantarum wild type (WT), L. plantarum Dlt mutant, conditioned medium or medium control (9 d), and subjected to GD under anesthesia using an i.g. Teflon catheter. Effects were measured by heart rate (HR) changes during noxious distension (60 mm Hg) compared to baseline HR values. We also investigated the localization of viable, green fluorescent protein-transfected bacteria in the stomach mucosa. Viable L. reuteri decreased the bradycardia induced by noxious GD compared to placebo controls (P < 0.001). Heat-killed or gamma-irradiated L. reuteri and conditioned medium did not have a protective effect in GD. Viable L. plantarum WT and Dlt mutant, previously shown to be effective antinociceptive agents in CRD, showed no protective effect in GD. All viable bacteria were associated with the pars glandularis of the rat stomach. Thus, we conclude that the antinociceptive mechanisms of action of probiotic bacteria differ between the stomach and the colon. Symptom alleviation cannot be attributed to the localization of the bacteria in the stomach. Information derived from effects of CRD cannot be extrapolated to effects in the stomach, which are likely to be strain and organ specific.},

   abstract = {The gut flora carries out important functions for human health, although most of them are still unknown, and an alteration of any of them, due to a condition of dysbiosis, can lead to relevant pathological implications. Commensal bacteria in the gut are essential for the preservation of the integrity of the mucosal barrier function and an alteration in the anatomic functional integrity of this barrier has been implicated in the pathophysiologic process of different diseases. The gut microflora plays a role in modulating the intestinal immune system; in fact, it is essential for the maturation of gut-associated lymphatic tissue, the secretion of IgA and the production of antimicrobial peptides. The enteric flora represents a potent bioreactor which controls several metabolic functions, even if most of them are still unknown. The main metabolic functions are represented by the fermentation of indigestible food substances into simple sugars, absorbable nutrients, and short-chain fatty acids. Furthermore, the gut microbiota exerts important trophic and developmental functions on the intestinal mucosa. This overview focuses briefly on the physiological role of the gut microbiota in maintaining a healthy state and the potential role played by disturbances of both the function and composition of the gut microbiota in determining important pathological conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and cancer.},

   abstract = {Introduction. Constipation is a common adverse drug reaction. Objective. Study associations between drugs and constipation in nursing home residents. Design. Cross-sectional study. Material and Methods. Nursing home residents above 60 years of age were included. Demographics, diet, physical activity, activity of daily living, nutritional status, use of drugs, and diseases were recorded. Constipation was defined as functional constipation or constipation-predominant IBS according to the Rome III criteria and/or regular use of laxatives. Drugs were classified according to the Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical Classification System (ATC), and anticholinergic effect was noted. Results. In all, 79 men and 188 women with a mean age of 85.4 (SD 7.1) years were included. The prevalence of constipation was 71.5%. Use of drugs in general, including polypharmacy, was not associated with constipation. Reduced activity of daily living (OR = 0.71, 95% CI : 0.60-0.84, P < 0.001), other antidepressants (N06AX) (OR 3.08, 95% CI : 1.09-8.68, P = 0.03), and benzodiazepine derivatives (N05BA) (OR = 2.80, 95% CI : 1.12-7.04, P = 0.03) were significantly associated with constipation; drugs with markedly anticholinergic effect (OR = 3.7, 95% CI : 0.78-17.53, P = 0.10), natural opium alkaloid (N02AA) (OR = 5.01, 95% CI : 0.95-25.94, P = 0.06), and propionic acid derivatives (M01AE) (OR = 7.00, 95% CI : 0.75-65.08, P = 0.09) showed a trend. Conclusion. In elderly with constipation, focus should be on specific groups of drugs and nonpharmacological factors, not on drugs in general.},

   abstract = {Enterococci belong to the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and they are of importance in foods due to their involvement in food spoilage and fermentations, as well as their utilisation as probiotics in humans and slaughter animals. However, they are also important nosocomial pathogens that cause bacteraemia, endocarditis and other infections. Some strains are resistant to many antibiotics and possess virulence factors such as adhesins, invasins, pili and haemolysin. The role of enterococci in disease has raised questions on their safety for use in foods or as probiotics. Studies on the incidence of virulence traits among enterococcal strains isolated from food showed that some can harbour virulence traits, but it is also thought that virulence is not the result of the presence of specific virulence determinants alone, but is rather a more intricate process. Specific genetic lineages of hospital-adapted strains have emerged, such as E. faecium clonal complex (CC) 17 and E. faecalis CC2, CC9, CC28 and CC40, which are high risk enterococcal clonal complexes. These are characterised by the presence of antibiotic resistance determinants and/or virulence factors, often located on pathogenicity islands or plasmids. Mobile genetic elements thus are considered to play a major role in the establishment of problematic lineages. Although enterococci occur in high numbers in certain types of fermented cheeses and sausages, they are not deliberately added as starter cultures. Some E. faecium and E. faecalis strains are used as probiotics and are ingested in high numbers, generally in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. Such probiotics are administered to treat diarrhoea, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea or irritable bowel syndrome, to lower cholesterol levels or to improve host immunity. In animals, enterococcal probiotics are mainly used to treat or prevent diarrhoea, for immune stimulation or to improve growth. From a food microbiological point of view, the safety of the bacteria used as probiotics must be assured, and data on the major strains in use so far indicate that they are safe. The advantage of use of probiotics in slaughter animals, from a food microbiological point of view, lies in the reduction of zoonotic pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract of animals which prevents the transmission of these pathogens via food. The use of enterococcal probiotics should, in view of the development of problematic lineages and the potential for gene transfer in the gastrointestinal tract of both humans and animals, be carefully monitored, and the advantages of using these and new strains should be considered in a well contemplated risk/benefit analysis.},

   abstract = {What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Nearly 90% of patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) report sensitivities to a wide variety of dietary comestibles. Current questionnaire-based literature suggests that citrus fruits, tomatoes, vitamin C, artificial sweeteners, coffee, tea, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, and spicy foods tend to exacerbate symptoms, while calcium glycerophosphate and sodium bicarbonate tend to improve symptoms. At present we recommend employing a controlled method to determine dietary sensitivities, such as an elimination diet, in order to identify sensitivities while at the same time maintain optimal nutritional intake. We review current literature with regard to diet's effect upon IC/BPS and common comorbidities (irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, neuropathic pain, vulvodynia, and headache) with a focus upon questionnaire-based investigations. We discuss the pathologic mechanisms that may link diet and IC/BPS related-pain, concentrating upon specific comestibles such as acidic foods, foods high in potassium, caffeine, and alcohol. Up to 90% of patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) report sensitivities to a wide variety of comestibles. Pathological mechanisms suggested to be responsible for the relationship between dietary intake and symptom exacerbation include peripheral and/or central neural upregulation, bladder epithelial dysfunction, and organ 'cross-talk', amongst others. Current questionnaire-based data suggests that citrus fruits, tomatoes, vitamin C, artificial sweeteners, coffee, tea, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, and spicy foods tend to exacerbate symptoms, while calcium glycerophosphate and sodium bicarbonate tend to improve symptoms. Specific comestible sensitivities varied between patients and may have been influenced by comorbid conditions. This suggests that a controlled method to determine dietary sensitivities, such as an elimination diet, may play an important role in patient management.},

   abstract = {The functioning of the gastrointestinal tract is under the control of the most extensive system of peripheral neurons in the body, the enteric nervous system, and the largest endocrine system of the body, the GEP endocrine system. The enteric nervous system in large mammals contains 500 million neurons, and the GEP endocrine system produces more than 30 hormones. Numerous enteric neuropathies affecting both humans and animals have been described and digestive disorders affect commercially important species, such as horses and cattle. The most severe enteric neuropathies (e.g., lethal white syndrome in horses or Hirschsprung's disease in humans) can be fatal. Also, horses with ileus or other digestive disorders are commonly euthanized. In this review we discuss examples of enteric neuropathies that affect agricultural animals and humans: prion disease, postoperative ileus, distal enteric aganglionosis, and infective diarrhea. Enteric neurons and glia are a location of prion proteins and are involved in transmission of the infection from gut to brain and brain to gut. Postoperative ileus is a complex disorder involving the local inhibitory effects of sympathetic nervous system activation and the release of opioids, presumably from enteric neurons. Intestinal inflammation, especially of the external muscle that includes enteric ganglia, also occurs in ileus. Congenital distal bowel aganglionosis, responsible for lethal white syndrome in horses, Hirschsprung's disease in humans, and similar conditions in mice and rats, is a fatal condition if untreated. Mutations of the same genes can cause the condition in each of these species. The only effective current treatment is surgical removal of the aganglionic bowel. Infectious diarrheas involve activation of enteric secretomotor neurons by pathogens and the toxins they produce, which causes substantial fluid loss. Strategies to target enteric neurons in the treatment of secretory diarrheas have not been developed. Disorders of enteroendocrine cells, other than GEP endocrine tumors, are less well documented. However, evidence for the involvement of gut endocrine cells in a subset of patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and in the symptomology of celiac disease, has been demonstrated. Further investigation of the involvement of enteric neural and endocrine signaling systems in digestive disorders, especially in agricultural and companion animals, may lead to diagnostic and therapeutic advances.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is considered as a risk factor for many functional digestive disorders. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence and the association of functional digestive symptoms affecting the upper and the lower digestive tract in patients eligible for bariatric surgery. METHODS: Before surgery, 120 consecutive patients with normal upper endoscopy (7.5% males, mean BMI 44 +/- 6 m/kg(2)) have filled a standard questionnaire in order to evaluate the presence of depressive symptoms and functional digestive disorders according to the Rome criteria. The major symptoms (esophageal, gastroduodenal, anorectal, and abdominal pain) were coded as dichotomous variables. Data analysis was performed using multivariate logistic regression with a backwards selection procedure adjusted only for the variables that were significant in univariate analysis (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Functional symptoms were present in 89% of the subjects (2.5 functional digestive symptoms/subject). Depression symptoms were found in 43% of the patients. Esophageal symptoms were independent predictors for the presence of gastric, bowel, and anorectal symptoms. Functional abdominal pain and bowel symptoms were present, respectively, in 19% and 84% of the patients. Approximately half of the patients have specific functional bowel disorders (28.6% constipation, 18% irritable bowel syndrome, 18% diarrhea, 1% bloating) and 35.7% have non-specific bowel disorders. Anorectal symptoms were found in 40% of the patients: difficult defecation in 32% and fecal incontinence in 9.8% of the patients. Depression was an independent predictor for anorectal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the high prevalence of functional bowel symptoms in patients complaining of morbid obesity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Food-related symptoms are commonly described by patients with functional bowel disorders, but dietary change as an evidence-based therapy has not been part of routine management strategies. This reviews aims to discuss strategies commonly applied. METHOD: Published literature was reviewed. RESULTS: Traditional approaches involve elimination diets followed by placebo-controlled reintroduction of specific foods, which is tedious at best and not applied in routine practice. Pathogenically-based approaches include determining what food components are inducing food hypersensitivity responses using specific biomarkers, but this is probably applicable to a small proportion of patients only and has met with only limited success. Food bioactive chemicals, such as salicylates, have been targeted, but there is a paucity of quality evidence for or against this approach. In contrast, targeting poorly absorbed dietary components that might induce luminal distension via osmotic effects and rapid fermentation (FODMAPs) has been successful and the efficacy of the dietitian-delivered low FODMAP diet is now supported by high quality evidence. Improvement of all symptoms of FBD in three out of four patients has been achieved. The diet may potentially improve stool frequency in patients with an ileal pouch or a high output ileostomy, or functional symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. FODMAPs in enteral formulas may also be responsible for diarrhoea induced by enteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: Dietary restriction of FODMAPs is an effective therapy in the majority of patients with functional bowel symptoms and, provided dietitians are trained in the technique, should be first line therapy.},

   abstract = {There is an undeniable link between gastrointestinal disorders and malnutrition. Chronic diarrhoea is one of the most common gastrointestinal conditions that can impact a patient's nutritional status. The nutritional consequences will depend on the cause of the diarrhoea as well as the location and extent of gastrointestinal involvement. In general, malabsorption plays a central role in the interaction between malnutrition and chronic diarrhoea. Malabsorption can result in both nutritional deficits and diarrhoea. With severe malnutrition, chronic diarrhoea can persist due to impaired immune function and poor mucosal recovery. Food intolerance and an inappropriate diet in the setting of malabsorption may also contribute to chronic diarrhoea. Patients may attribute their gastrointestinal symptoms to specific dietary intake, which can lead to self-imposed indiscriminate dietary restrictions. Therefore, disease-specific treatment in conjunction with appropriate nutritional counselling and intervention is recommended in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in patients with chronic diarrhoea. Specialized nutritional support through enteral or parenteral administration may be required to treat severe caloric and micronutrient deficiencies. In this review, we aim to summarize the mechanism, diagnosis, and treatment of the nutritional consequences of chronic diarrhoea.},

   abstract = {This article describes changes in the basic digestive functions (motility, secretion, intraluminal digestion, absorption) that occur during aging. Elderly individuals frequently have oropharyngeal muscle dysmotility and altered swallowing of food. Reductions in esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressures are also more common in the aged and may cause gastroesophageal reflux. Gastric motility and emptying and small bowel motility are generally normal in elderly subjects, although delayed motility and gastric emptying have been reported in some cases. The propulsive motility of the colon is also decreased, and this alteration is associated with neurological and endocrine-paracrine changes in the colonic wall. Decreased gastric secretions (acid, pepsin) and impairment of the mucous-bicarbonate barrier are frequently described in the elderly and may lead to gastric ulcer. Exocrine pancreatic secretion is often decreased, as is the bile salt content of bile. These changes represent the underlying mechanisms of symptomatic gastrointestinal dysfunctions in the elderly, such as dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, primary dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, primary constipation, maldigestion, and reduced absorption of nutrients. Therapeutic management of these conditions is also described. The authors also review the gastrointestinal diseases that are more common in the elderly, such as atrophic gastritis, gastric ulcer, colon diverticulosis, malignant tumors, gallstones, chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, Hepato Cellular Carcinoma (HCC), and chronic pancreatitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder in the general population, and is linked to considerable impairments in daily functioning. Little is known about the prevalence of IBS symptoms among students. This study examined the prevalence and characteristics of IBS, sex differences, associations to other somatic complaints and sleep, quality of life (QoL), and childhood abdominal pain in a German university student population. METHODS: Using an Internet-based questionnaire, we assessed IBS criteria (according to Rome III), health complaints, health-related QoL (12-item short-form), healthcare-seeking behavior, absenteeism from classes, and subjective attributions in a sample of 2399 university students (mean age: 24.16 years; 1701 female and 696 male students). RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS-like symptoms was 18.1% with a significant difference between male (15.2%) and female (21.0%) students. Logistic regression models showed that being long-term student doubles the risk for having IBS [adjusted Odds ratio (OR)=2.16], as did the presence of other health problems: recurrent backaches (adjusted OR=2.15), troubles falling asleep (adjusted OR=1.52), and recurrent abdominal pain during childhood (adjusted OR=2.01). The IBS group had significant impairment on 12-item short-form physical and mental dimensions compared with asymptomatic students. Approximately 60% of participants fulfilling IBS criteria never consulted a physician. Male students attributed their symptoms significantly more to nutrition than female students did, who attributed their symptoms significantly more often to stress and anxiety. CONCLUSION: IBS is a common syndrome among German university students and goes along with impaired health-related QoL. According to our data, students reporting recurrent abdominal pain in childhood are especially at risk for IBS.},

   abstract = {Extensive research over the past half century has shown that curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of the golden spice turmeric (Curcuma longa), can modulate multiple cell signaling pathways. Extensive clinical trials over the past quarter century have addressed the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of this nutraceutical against numerous diseases in humans. Some promising effects have been observed in patients with various pro-inflammatory diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, uveitis, ulcerative proctitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel disease, tropical pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer, idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor, oral lichen planus, gastric inflammation, vitiligo, psoriasis, acute coronary syndrome, atherosclerosis, diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic microangiopathy, lupus nephritis, renal conditions, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, beta-thalassemia, biliary dyskinesia, Dejerine-Sottas disease, cholecystitis, and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Curcumin has also shown protection against hepatic conditions, chronic arsenic exposure, and alcohol intoxication. Dose-escalating studies have indicated the safety of curcumin at doses as high as 12 g/day over 3 months. Curcumin's pleiotropic activities emanate from its ability to modulate numerous signaling molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic proteins, NF-kappaB, cyclooxygenase-2, 5-LOX, STAT3, C-reactive protein, prostaglandin E(2), prostate-specific antigen, adhesion molecules, phosphorylase kinase, transforming growth factor-beta, triglyceride, ET-1, creatinine, HO-1, AST, and ALT in human participants. In clinical trials, curcumin has been used either alone or in combination with other agents. Various formulations of curcumin, including nanoparticles, liposomal encapsulation, emulsions, capsules, tablets, and powder, have been examined. In this review, we discuss in detail the various human diseases in which the effect of curcumin has been investigated.},

   abstract = {Although much has been published about curcumin, which is obtained from turmeric, comparatively little is known about turmeric itself. Turmeric, a golden spice obtained from the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa, has been used to give color and taste to food preparations since ancient times. Traditionally, this spice has been used in Ayurveda and folk medicine for the treatment of such ailments as gynecological problems, gastric problems, hepatic disorders, infectious diseases, and blood disorders. Modern science has provided the scientific basis for the use of turmeric against such disorders. Various chemical constituents have been isolated from this spice, including polyphenols, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenoids, sterols, and alkaloids. Curcumin, which constitutes 2-5% of turmeric, is perhaps the most-studied component. Although some of the activities of turmeric can be mimicked by curcumin, other activities are curcumin-independent. Cell-based studies have demonstrated the potential of turmeric as an antimicrobial, insecticidal, larvicidal, antimutagenic, radioprotector, and anticancer agent. Numerous animal studies have shown the potential of this spice against proinflammatory diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, depression, diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis. At the molecular level, this spice has been shown to modulate numerous cell-signaling pathways. In clinical trials, turmeric has shown efficacy against numerous human ailments including lupus nephritis, cancer, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, acne, and fibrosis. Thus, a spice originally common in the kitchen is now exhibiting activities in the clinic. In this review, we discuss the chemical constituents of turmeric, its biological activities, its molecular targets, and its potential in the clinic.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) affect 15%-20% of the general pediatric and adult population. Animal models suggest that a neonatal stress such as invasive procedures and maternal separation could be responsible for visceral hypersensitivity and FGID. We tested the hypothesis that congenital esophageal atresia (EA), a condition corrected during the neonatal period and associated with multiple stresses, is a clinically significant risk factor for the development of FGID later in life. We postulated that, to be clinically significant, the effect of neonatal stress on the incidence of FGID should be as strong as that of enteric infections in the development of irritable bowel syndrome in children. METHODS: Subjects with EA and healthy controls were enrolled in this multicenter cohort study. Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed by a questionnaire and FGID was diagnosed using the Rome III criteria. RESULTS: Fifty-three children (25 girls; median age, 12 years) with EA were compared to 72 age- and sex-matched controls. Although 11 children with EA (21%) had a FGID diagnosis versus 8 controls (11%), this difference was not significant (chi(2) = 2.20, P > 0.05). In subjects with EA, the presence of associated malformations, the occurrence of complications during the first month, and the length of hospital stay > 30 days did not influence the incidence of FGID. Chronic abdominal pain was present in 38% of subjects with EA versus 25% of controls (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal stress secondary to surgical correction of EA is not a clinically significant risk factor for the development of FGID in childhood.},

   abstract = {There is growing evidence that many aspects of our lifestyle and the environment we now live in contribute to the development of disease. The luminal digestive tract is a clear target of the influence of dietary components, alcohol, microbial organisms, and other ingested materials. External factors including obesity, lack of physical exercise, and tobacco consumption also impact diseases of the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A growing understanding of the microbiome which forms an integral part of the human organism indicates that this is another important external force that impacts human health and disease. The luminal GI tract conditions that arise, at least in part, from these external factors range from malignancies (squamous cell esophageal cancer, Barrett's esophagus and associated esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer), idiopathic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases, and post-infectious syndromes including post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome, post-infectious dyspepsia and other functional GI disorders. Of particular interest, given their increase in prevalence in much of the world, are immune-mediated conditions in which food antigens are the driving force behind disease development. These entities include celiac disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and food allergies. Celiac disease is a prime example of a condition mediated by dietary factors whose pathogenesis has only recently been determined, providing opportunities for developing treatment options beyond the gluten-free diet. While a genetic basis for this disease clearly exists, it is believed that environmental factors such as an increase in gluten in the human diet account for its rising prevalence, now roughly 1% of genetically susceptible populations in all continents. Proposed therapeutic strategies span from preventing disease by modulating the time of gluten introduction in infants, to reducing exposure to gluten by developing strains of wheat with lower levels of gluten, degrading ingested gluten peptides within the intestinal lumen via endopeptidases or modulating uptake of these peptides across intestinal tight junctions. Other novel treatments in development focus on interfering with the immune events that lead to disease once gluten accesses the lamina propria including altering the immune milieu from a Th1-predominant response via hookworm infection, inhibiting tissue transglutaminase, and blocking antigen presentation and/or T-cell responses to gluten peptides. While new treatment options for celiac disease reflect the complex interaction of diet, genetic factors and the host immune response, the implications for treatment of many conditions of the large and small intestine that arise from environmental and lifestyle are as basic as ensuring adequate nutrition, regular exercise and cessation of tobacco use. Much more needs to be learned about the microbiome, dietary and other factors and their interaction with the human host in order to develop potential new treatment strategies for diseases that result from the environment and lifestyle.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The aim of the present study was to evaluate proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five children with IBS (17 diarrhea-predominant, 7 constipation-predominant, and 11 mixed type) and 25 healthy children as healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. All of the participants completed a questionnaire recording the duration, severity, and associated academic and social influences. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and cultured for 24 hours with and without 1 or 5 ng/mL Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cytokine production including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10 was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Children with IBS revealed lower baseline and significantly lower IL-10 levels after LPS stimulation compared with HCs (P = 0.001). Although not to a significant level, TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were higher in children with IBS compared with HCs. The IL-10 levels in patients with IBS with strong pain intensity were lower both in baseline and under 1 ng/mL LPS stimulation. The levels became significantly lower under 5 ng/mL LPS stimulation compared with those experiencing mild and moderate pain intensity (P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that children with IBS tend to produce lower amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 at baseline and after LPS stimulation, implying that defects in immune modulation may contribute to IBS in children.},

METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study of 319 students (239 males and 80 females, age 22.3 +/- 2.5 years) from the 6 grade levels of the Medical College in Korea. All students filled out a self-reported questionnaire for ROME III criteria. They also completed a questionnaire to validate dietary habits and food frequency in Korean. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of IBS was 29.2% without correlation to age, body mass index and grade level in Medical School. However, the prevalence was significantly higher in females than males (33/80 vs 60/239, P = 0.007). There were no significant differences between the IBS-group and the non-IBS group in aspect of nutrition. Not only the diet habits, but also the daily nutritional intake, and even the breakdown into the 12 micronutrients, yielded no significant differences between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-nine percent of the medical college students have IBS with a greater prevalence in females. The dietary habits and nutritional intake of the students might not be associated with IBS.},

The question arises whether exposure to these drugs is associated with the development of IBS symptoms. Aim of this study was therefore to assess the use of PPIs and NSAIDs in patients with IBS versus controls. METHODS: Cases of IBS from the last 5 years were reviewed. All patients having had at least one prescription for a particular drug (PPIs, NSAIDs, SSRIs, diuretics, ACE inhibitors) in the 6 months prior to the time of initial symptom onset were considered exposed. The control group consisted of individuals randomly selected from the general population. RESULTS: 287 cases of IBS were retrieved for analysis together with 287 age and sex-matched controls. Exposure to PPIs and NSAIDs was significantly higher in IBS patients, whereas no association between ACE inhibitor use and IBS was found. PPIs were not significantly associated when excluding patients with gastrointestinal reflux disease or functional dyspepsia. Exposure to SSRIs was also positively associated with IBS, but only when patients with psychiatric comorbidity were included in the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Medications that may alter intestinal homeostasis such as NSAIDs and PPIs were more frequently used in IBS patients compared to controls. This association might be relevant for everyday clinical practice, but it is remains to be elucidated whether this association is of etiological nature.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder, characterized by recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort in combination with disturbed bowel habits in the absence of identifiable organic cause. Visceral hypersensitivity has emerged as a key hypothesis in explaining the painful symptoms in IBS and has been proposed as a "biological hallmark" for the condition. Current techniques of assessing visceral perception include the computerized barostat using rectal distensions, registering responses induced by sensory stimuli including the flexor reflex and cerebral evoked potentials, as well as brain imaging modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. These methods have provided further insight into alterations in pain processing in IBS, although the most optimal method and condition remain to be established. In an attempt to give an overview of these methods, a literature search in the electronic databases PubMed and MEDLINE was executed using the search terms "assessment of visceral pain/visceral nociception/visceral hypersensitivity" and "irritable bowel syndrome." Both original articles and review articles were considered for data extraction. This review aims to discuss currently used modalities in assessing visceral perception, along with advantages and limitations, and aims also to define future directions for methodological aspects in visceral pain research. Although novel paradigms such as brain imaging and neurophysiological recordings have been introduced in the study of visceral pain, confirmative studies are warranted to establish their robustness and clinical relevance. Therefore, subjective verbal reporting following rectal distension currently remains the best-validated technique in assessing visceral perception in IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder characterized by abdominal pain related to defecation with a change in bowel habit. Patients with IBS often exhibit increased visceral sensitivity, which can be tested clinically by rectal balloon distension procedures. This paper aims to give an overview of mechanisms involved in visceral hypersensitivity in IBS by reviewing recent literature. DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT: A literature search in the electronic databases Pubmed and MEDLINE was executed using the search terms 'visceral pain' or 'visceral nociception' or 'visceral hypersensitivity' and 'irritable bowel syndrome.' Both original articles and review articles were considered for data extraction. RESULTS: Recent advances in molecular neurophysiology provide knowledge to better understand the underlying mechanism in pain generation in the human gut, in particular, in IBS patients. Sensitization of peripheral nociceptive afferents, more specifically high-threshold afferents, has been proposed as one of the principle mechanism in the development of visceral hypersensitivity. On the other hand, central mechanisms also play an important role. In terms of clinical testing of visceral perception, considerable discrepancies remain, however, across different centres. CONCLUSION: Alterations in the modulatory balance of pro- and antinociceptive central processing of noxious peripheral input may serve as in integrative hypothesis for explaining visceral hypersensitivity in IBS. Nevertheless, it remains troublesome to estimate the contribution of central and peripheral factors in visceral hypersensitivity, posing a challenge in determining effective therapeutic entities.},

   abstract = {The toxicity of the recombinant protein towards the expression host remains a significant deterrent for bioprocess development. In this study, the expression of human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (hGM-CSF), which is known to be toxic to its host, was enhanced many folds using a combination of genetic and bioprocess strategies in Escherichia coli. The N terminus attachment of endoxylanase and asparaginase signal sequences from Bacillus subtilis and E. coli, respectively, in combination with and without His-tag, considerably improved expression levels. Induction and media optimization studies in shake flask cultures resulted in a maximal hGM-CSF concentration of 365 mg/L in the form of inclusion bodies (IBs) with a specific product yield (Y (P/X)) of 120 mg/g dry cell weight in case of the asparaginase signal. Culturing the cells in nutrient rich Terrific broth maintained the specific product yields (Y (P/X)) while a 6.6-fold higher volumetric concentration of both product and biomass was obtained. The purification and refolding steps were optimized resulting in a 95% pure protein with a fairly high refolding yield of 45%. The biological activity of the refolded protein was confirmed by a cell proliferation assay on hGM-CSF dependent human erythroleukemia TF-1 cells. This study demonstrated that this indeed is a viable route for the efficient production of hGM-CSF.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a major cause of abdominal discomfort and gut dysfunction worldwide. It is a poorly understood functional gastrointestinal disorder for which no effective medication is available. It is a benign condition, but its social and economic burden is significant. The symptoms consist of abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and irregular bowel movements. Alterations in the intestinal microbiota and mucosal inflammation may contribute to the development of IBS and probiotics could thus relieve the symptoms. This review gives an overview on the existing data on the effects of probiotics on the gastrointestinal symptoms of IBS. METHODS: A PUBMED search was made to review the relevant literature, and additional studies were obtained from the references of the selected articles. RESULTS: Clinical trials suggest that certain probiotics or combinations of bacteria have beneficial effects on the IBS symptoms. However the heterogeneity of studies, e.g. suboptimal study design, inadequate number of subjects, different doses and vehicles, inadequate length, make it difficult to compare the differences between probiotics and the effect may be strain-specific. CONCLUSIONS: Though evidence is very promising, no general recommendations on the use of probiotics in IBS can be given yet. Further clinical trials and data on the mechanisms of action are needed. Probiotics are considered safe and if future scientific data is able to substantiate their efficacy in IBS, they certainly could be a treatment option in relieving the symptoms in IBS.},

   abstract = {Concern exists that increasing fructose consumption, particularly in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, is resulting in increasing rates of fructose intolerance and aggravation of clinical symptoms in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome. Most clinical trials designed to test this hypothesis have used pure fructose, a form not commonly found in the food supply, often in quantities and concentrations that exceed typical fructose intake levels. In addition, the amount of fructose provided in tests for malabsorption, which is thought to be a key cause of intolerance, often exceeds the normal physiological absorption capacity for this sugar. To help health professionals accurately identify and treat this condition, this article reviews clinical data related to understanding fructose malabsorption and intolerance (i.e., malabsorption that manifests with symptoms) relative to usual fructose and other carbohydrate intake. Because simultaneous consumption of glucose attenuates fructose malabsorption, information on the fructose and glucose content of foods, beverages, and ingredients representing a variety of food categories is provided.},

Although dietary intake has been the focus of previous research, attention to specific nutrients has been rare. We hypothesized that there is an association between the severity of IBS symptoms and the intake of specific food groups and specific nutrients. In this cross-sectional study, 17 human subjects with IBS, as defined according to the Rome II criteria, were recruited. IBS symptoms were recorded on diary cards every evening for 7 days, and an IBS sum score was calculated (range, 0-15). Intake of food was assessed from a food diary kept by the subjects in the same period. Associations between IBS sum score and dietary intake were explored. The daily IBS sum score was 6.43 (range, 3.86- 9.09). Intake of vitamin B(6) was the only component of the diet that was significantly associated with the IBS sum score. The median daily intake of vitamin B(6) was 0.9 mg/day (range, 0.6-1.5), the recommended daily intake for men and women is 1.6 mg/day or more and 1.2 mg/day or more, respectively. A high symptom score was associated with low vitamin B(6) intake (adjusted R(2) = 0.583; beta = -4.431; 95% confidence interval, -6.386 to -2.476; P = 0.0002). A significant inverse association between intake of vitamin B(6) and severity of IBS symptoms might have clinical implications.},

METHODS: Between November 2008 to December 2009, we estimated the prevalence of IBS in a rural community of Ballabgarh block, located in Haryana state. A structured questionnaire based on Rome III module was used to collect symptoms related to IBS from all the participants in a door to door survey. A Rome III criterion was used for diagnosis of IBS. IBS was further classified based on predominance of symptoms as constipation predominant, diarrhea predominant, mixed and unspecified based on Rome III module. RESULTS: There were 4,767 participants (mean age 34.6 +/- 10.8, males 50%). Overall, 555 (11.6%; 95% CI, 10.7-12.5) had constipation, 542 (11.4%; 95% CI, 10.5-12.3) diarrhea and 823 (17.3%; 95% CI, 16.2-18.4) abdominal pain. The overall prevalence of IBS was 4% (95% CI, 3.5-4.6). The prevalence of constipation predominant IBS was 0.3% (95% CI, 0.16-0.49), diarrhea predominant IBS 1.5% (95% CI, 1.18-1.90), mixed IBS 1.7% (95% CI, 1.35-2.11) and unsubtyped IBS 0.5% (95% CI, 0.32-0.75). The prevalence of IBS was significantly higher in females compared with males (4.8% vs 3.2%, P = 0.008). However, there was no significant difference between males and females in the prevalence of different subtypes of IBS. The prevalence increased with age. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IBS in a North Indian community is 4%. IBS poses a significant burden on the rural adults.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Increased intestinal permeability of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients has been recently associated with a decreased level of glutamine synthetase. Neonatal maternal deprivation (NMD) is considered as an IBS-like model. The aim of our study was to investigate whether early nutritional intervention with glutamine may attenuate the deleterious impact of early life stress on gut barrier function in NMD. METHODS: 124 rat pups were separated from their dam 3 h daily during postnatal days 2-14, or left undisturbed (NS). Separated rats received by gavage either with alanyl-glutamine (GLN), an isonitrogenous amino acid mix (AA, control) or an equal amount of drinking water (H(2)O). Production of cytokines was measured by multiplex, expression of COX-2, PPARgamma, tight junction proteins and TLR4 by western blot. Intestinal permeability was studied by Lactulose/Mannitol test. RESULTS: Treatment of pups with GLN or AA abolished the decrease in body weight observed in NMD. Treatment with GLN decreased in the colon (i) TLR4 expression at D20, (ii) IL-2 and -10 productions at D60 (iii) protein expression of occludin at D20 compared to AA. GLN also decreased colon expression of COX2 and PPARgamma at D60 compared to NS. Colon production of IFNgamma is significantly reduced by GLN compared to H(2)O. No significant change in intestinal permeability was observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that an early nutritional intervention with alanyl-glutamine specifically abolished the up-regulation of TLR4 expression in NMD. Glutamine may be evaluated as a potential treatment for IBS patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic debilitating functional gastrointestinal disorder. Diet and lifestyle changes are important management strategies. The aim of these guidelines is to systematically review key aspects of the dietary management of IBS, with the aim of providing evidence-based guidelines for use by registered dietitians. METHODS: Questions relating to diet and IBS symptom management were developed by a guideline development group. These included the role of milk and lactose, nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP), fermentable carbohydrates in abdominal bloating, probiotics and empirical or elimination diets. A comprehensive literature search was conducted and relevant studies from January 1985 to November 2009 were identified using the electronic database search engines: Cinahl, Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science. Evidence statements, recommendations, good practice points and research recommendations were developed. RESULTS: Thirty studies were critically appraised. A dietetic care pathway was produced following a logical sequence of treatment and formed the basis of these guidelines. Three lines of dietary management were identified. first line: Clinical and dietary assessment, healthy eating and lifestyle management with some general advice on lactose and NSP. Second line: Advanced dietary interventions to improve symptoms based on NSP, fermentable carbohydrates and probiotics. Third line: Elimination and empirical diets. Research recommendations were also identified relating to the need for adequately powered and well designed randomised controlled trials. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide evidence-based details of how to achieve the successful dietary management of IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often associated with psychological distress, is characterized by increased gut permeability and visceral sensitivity. In animals, stress increases intestinal paracellular permeability (IPP), visceral sensitivity and colonic proteolytic activity. Estradiol reduces IPP and affects visceral sensitivity in non-stressed ovariectomized rats, but whether estrogens affect stress-induced hyperpermeability and hypersensitivity in cyclic females remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate (i) the effects of a phytoestrogen-rich soy germ fermented ingredient (SG) on visceral hypersensitivity, hyperpermeability and other symptoms in stressed intact female rats, (ii) the mechanisms of action involved on the basis of both estrogenic and protease inhibitor activities of SG. METHODS: Female rats received orally for 15-d either SG, 17beta-estradiol benzoate (EB), or vehicles, with or without the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI182.780 before stress. Visceral sensitivity, IPP, faecal proteolytic activity, plasma corticosterone, rat mast cell protease II immunostaining, and occludin expression were assessed. RESULTS: Stress increased IPP (concomitantly to a drop in occludin expression), visceral sensitivity, faecal proteolytic activity and plasma corticosterone. Similarly to EB, SG prevented the stress-induced hyperpermeability, and hypersensitivity, without changes in plasma corticosterone. SG inhibited the increase in faecal proteolytic activity, enhanced occludin expression, and reduced the colonic mast cell density. All SG effects, except decrease on faecal proteolytic activity, were blocked by ICI182.780. CONCLUSION: A 2-wk oral treatment with SG prevented the stress-induced hyperpermeability and visceral hypersensitivity in cyclic rats through ER activation, and blocked the increase in colonic proteolytic activity, suggesting that SG can be promising in IBS management.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder comprising abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, and disordered defecation. The prevalence of IBS is 10-15% in the general population. This study investigated the prevalence of IBS and the relationship between IBS and stress, lifestyle, and dietary habits among nursing and medical school students. METHODS: A blank self-administrated questionnaire was used to survey 2,639 students studying nursing or medicine. This questionnaire asked about IBS symptoms, lifestyle, dietary intake, life events, anxiety, and depression. The questionnaires were collected from 2,365 students (89.6%) and the responses of 1,768 students (74.8%) were analyzed. RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS was 35.5% as a whole, 25.2% in males and 41.5% in females. Significantly higher stress scores (anxiety and depression) and life events were found in the IBS group than in the non-IBS group. Sleep disorders and the time spent sitting were also higher in males with IBS. In the IBS group, females ate less fish, fruit, milk, and green-yellow vegetables, and more processed food products than the non-IBS group (p = 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.032, p = 0.037, p < 0.001). The rates of missed meals and irregular mealtimes were significantly higher in females in the IBS group (p = 0.001, p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IBS was higher among nursing and medical students, and further interventional studies are needed to improve IBS symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence to support a role for the gastrointestinal microbiota in the etiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Given the evidence of an inflammatory component to IBS, the mucosa-associated microbiota potentially play a key role in its pathogenesis. The objectives were to compare the mucosa-associated microbiota between patients with diarrhea predominant IBS (IBS-D), constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C) and controls using fluorescent in situ hybridization and to correlate specific bacteria groups with individual IBS symptoms. METHODS: Forty-seven patients with IBS (27 IBS-D and 20 IBS-C) and 26 healthy controls were recruited to the study. Snap-frozen rectal biopsies were taken at colonoscopy and bacterial quantification performed by hybridizing frozen sections with bacterial-group specific oligonucleotide probes. KEY RESULTS: Patients with IBS had significantly greater numbers of total mucosa-associated bacteria per mm of rectal epithelium than controls [median 218 (IQR - 209) vs 128 (121) P = 0.007], and this was chiefly comprised of bacteroides IBS [69 (67) vs 14 (41) P = 0.001] and Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides [52 (58) vs 25 (35) P = 0.03]. Analysis of IBS sub-groups demonstrated that bifidobacteria were lower in the IBS-D group than in the IBS-C group and controls [24 (32) vs 54 (88) vs 32 (35) P = 0.011]. Finally, amongst patients with IBS, the maximum number of stools per day negatively correlated with the number of mucosa-associated bifidobacteria (P < 0.001) and lactobacilli (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: The mucosa-associated microbiota in patients with IBS is significantly different from healthy controls with increases in bacteroides and clostridia and a reduction in bifidobacteria in patients with IBS-D.},

   abstract = {As the gluten-free diet (GFD) gains in popularity with the general public, health practitioners are beginning to question its real health benefits. For those patients with celiac disease (CD), the GFD is considered medical nutrition therapy, as well as the only proven treatment that results in improvements in symptomatology and small bowel histology. Those with wheat allergy also benefit from the GFD, although these patients often do not need to restrict rye, barley, and oats from their diet. Gluten sensitivity is a controversial subject, where patients who have neither CD nor wheat allergy have varying degrees of symptomatic improvement on the GFD. Conditions in this category include dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and neurologic diseases such as gluten-sensitive ataxia and autism. It is important for patients and healthcare practitioners to understand the differences between these conditions, even though they may all respond to a GFD. Patients with CD can experience comorbid nutrition deficiencies and are at higher risk for the development of cancers and other autoimmune conditions. Those with wheat allergy and gluten sensitivity are thought not to be at higher risk for these complications. Defining the symptoms and biochemical markers for gluten-sensitive conditions is an important area for future investigations, and high-quality, large-scale randomized trials are needed to prove the true benefits of the GFD in this evolving field.},

These restrictions could put them at risk for disturbed eating. The purpose of this study was to determine if young adults with and without DRCHCs differed with regard to disturbed eating behaviors and related psychographics characteristics (i.e., body image attributes, mental disorders, intrapersonal characteristics and sociocultural environment [i.e., media and family]). Each DRCHC participant (cases=166) was matched to 4 healthy participants (controls=664) based on gender and BMI (+/-0.50 BMI units). Conditional logistic regression analyses indicate cases were twice as likely to have been diagnosed by a healthcare provider with an eating disorder (p=0.08, OR=1.99, CI(90) [1.03-3.83]). Cases were significantly more likely to use Inappropriate Compensatory Behaviors to manage their weight, i.e., excessive exercise (p=0.04, OR=1.41, CI(95) [1.02-1.94]) and misuse medication (p=0.04, OR=1.14, CI(95) [1.00-1.29]) than controls. Depression and anxiety were significantly higher, and health status was significantly poorer in cases compared with controls. DRCHC participants were less likely to report feeling body image pressures from the media, placed a greater value on their health, used social diversion, and recalled a greater emphasis being placed on their mothers' weights and mealtimes being less structured than control participants. Findings indicate that nutrition and other healthcare professionals should incorporate screening DRCHC patients for disturbed eating behaviors and eating disorders in their standards of care.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review interactions between the microbiota and the host in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), emphasizing areas of commonality and divergence. RECENT FINDINGS: Several lines of evidence support a role for the microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS and IBD. Some implicate the microbiota in a general sense and relate to variations in the composition of the microbiota between IBS, IBD and controls; others relate to the ability of events and interventions that disrupt/modify the microbiota to predispose to the development of IBS and IBD and, others still refer to reports of the ability of antibiotics, prebiotics or probiotics, in selected circumstances, to beneficially alter their clinical course. Enthusiasm for a role for a specific organism in precipitating disease has been largely (and contentiously) linked to IBD. Many issues remain unresolved and must wait for the application of modern microbiological techniques to well characterized populations and well matched controls. SUMMARY: It makes sense, given the size and complexity of the microbiota and its role in homeostasis, that the microbiota and its interactions with the host would play a role in the pathogenesis of IBS and IBD; sorting out the details has proven challenging but does offer new therapeutic avenues for both disorders.},

   abstract = {For decades, if not centuries, a variety of products with what would now be regarded as prebiotic and probiotic properties have been consumed by the general public and advocated for their benefits on health and, in particular, gastrointestinal well-being. More recently, medical science has taken a great interest in the population of micro-organisms, the gut microbiota that normally populates the human gut, and the range of important functions carried out by the microbiota in health is being progressively defined. As a corollary, the list of disorders and diseases that may result from disruption of the normal microbiota and/or its interaction with the host continues to grow. A scientific basis for the use of probiotics and prebiotics is, therefore, beginning to emerge. Unfortunately, although progress has been made, the clinical evidence to support the use of these preparations lags behind. Nevertheless, a number of human disease states may benefit from the use of probiotics, most notably, diarrheal illnesses, some inflammatory bowel diseases, certain infectious disorders, and irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics promote the growth of "good" bacteria, and although a variety of health benefits have been attributed to their use, prebiotics have been subjected to few large-scale clinical trials.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Gut directed hypnotherapy (HT) is shown to be effective in adult functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. We performed a systematic review to assess efficacy of HT in paediatric FAP/IBS patients. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials (RCT) in children with FAP or IBS, investigating efficacy of HT on the following outcomes: abdominal pain scores, quality of life, costs and school absenteeism. RESULTS: Three RCT comparing HT to a control treatment were included with sample sizes ranging from 22 to 52 children. We refrained from statistical pooling because of low number of studies and many differences in design and outcomes. Two studies examined HT performed by a therapist, one examined HT through self-exercises on audio CD. All trials showed statistically significantly greater improvement in abdominal pain scores among children receiving HT. One trial reported beneficial effects sustained after 1 year of follow-up. One trial reported statistically significant improvement in quality of life in the HT group. Two trials reported significant reductions in school absenteeism after HT. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic effects of HT seem superior to standard medical care in children with FAP or IBS. It remains difficult to quantify exact benefits. The need for more high quality research is evident.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common in children. Abdominal pain (AP) is the most common gastrointestinal (GI) symptom in children. The severity of AP drives medical consultations and quality of life in adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Thirty-eight percent of 8- to 15-year-old schoolchildren report AP weekly with 24% of those children reporting persistence of AP >8 weeks. Despite the high prevalence of AP, only 2% of school children seek medical attention for AP. Lack of parental knowledge on their child's symptoms may constitute one of the factors affecting the low ratio of consultation in children reporting AP. The aim was to assess parental reports of AP symptoms in a population of healthy community children. METHODS: Data of 5 studies with identical methodology to assess GI symptoms in children with celiac disease (CD), cow's milk allergy (CMA), pyloric stenosis (PS), Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP), and stem cell transplant (SC) and their healthy siblings were reviewed: a phone questionnaire on GI symptoms and Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rome III version questionnaire (QPGS-RIII). Inclusion criteria were healthy children 4 to 18 years of age with a sibling previously diagnosed with CD, CMA, PS, HSP, or SC. RESULTS: Data on 246 healthy children, mean age (9.8 years, range 3-24, 112 girls) were obtained. Parents reported presence of AP in the last 8 weeks before the telephone contact in 20 (8.1%) children (age range 4-18 years, 11 girls). There was no significant difference in AP prevalence between boys and girls (P = 0.64). Six children (2.4%) met QPGS-RIII diagnostic criteria for FGIDs: 3 functional abdominal pain (FAP) and 3 IBS. CONCLUSIONS: AP was common in community children. FAP was the most common FGID among healthy community children. The prevalence of AP by parental report is lower than the previously published prevalence of AP reported by children. Lack of awareness of children's symptoms may play a role in the low ratio of consultation for AP in symptomatic children. Future prospective studies should confirm our findings and investigate the factors influencing the medical consultation decision including parental awareness of children's symptoms.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that children who had pyloric stenosis are at greater risk for developing chronic abdominal pain because this cohort combines various risk factors: an early stressful event, gastric surgery, and perioperative nasogastric tube placement in most cases. STUDY DESIGN: This was a case control study of all children diagnosed with pyloric stenosis during infancy (cases) between January 1, 2000, and June 31, 2005, at Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago. Because of their similar genetic and socioeconomic backgrounds, siblings aged 4 to 20 years without a history of pyloric stenosis were selected as controls. Parents of children with symptoms completed the parental form of the Pediatric GI Symptoms Rome III version questionnaire for both cases and controls. The primary outcome was the prevalence of chronic abdominal pain, and the secondary outcome was the presence of pain-associated functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID), in accordance with Rome III criteria. RESULTS: Cases (n = 100; mean age, 7.49 +/- 1.43 years; 29 girls) and controls (n = 91; mean age, 9.20 +/- 4.19 years; 29 girls) participated in the study. Mean time to follow-up was 7.2 +/- 1.6 years. Chronic abdominal pain was significantly more common in cases than in controls (20/80 [25%] vs 5/91 [5.8%]; OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.5-12; P = .0045). Seven out of 20 subjects (35%) met the Rome III criteria for diagnosis of a pain-associated FGID (3 with irritable bowel syndrome, 2 with functional dyspepsia, and 2 with functional abdominal pain), and 1 patient in the control group (with irritable bowel syndrome) met these criteria (OR, 6.8; 95% CI, 0.82-56; P = .043). CONCLUSION: We have described a new model to study early life events in infants. Our findings suggest that the presence of pyloric stenosis in infancy and factors involved in its perioperative care represent risk factors in the development of chronic abdominal pain in children at long-term follow-up. This study provides important data to sustain the multifactorial theoretical construct of pain-associated FGID and underscores the importance of early life events in the development of chronic abdominal pain in children.},

We hypothesized that noninfectious causes of inflammation affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract early in life, such as cow's-milk allergy (CMA), can predispose to the development of FGIDs later in childhood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case-control study. Subjects were patients between 4 and 18 years diagnosed with CMA in the first year of life at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, IL, between January 2000 and June 2009. Diagnosis of CMA was based on history and clinical findings. Siblings 4 to 18 years of age without a history of CMA were selected as controls. Cases completed the parental form of the Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rome III version questionnaire to assess for GI symptoms. RESULTS: Fifty-two subjects (mean age 8.1 +/- 4.48 years, 62% girls) and 53 controls (mean age 9.7 +/- 4.20 years, 55% girls) participated in the study. Twenty-three of 52 subjects (44.2%) reported GI symptoms that included abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea compared with 11 of 53 controls (20.75%) (odds ratio 3.03, P = 0.01). Abdominal pain was significantly more common in cases (16/52, 30.8%) versus controls (5/53, 9.43%) (odds ratio 4.27 [1.43-12.7]) (chi(2) = 7.47, P = 0.01). Abnormal stool habits were more common in cases (15/52, 28.8%) versus controls (7/53, 13.2%), but the difference was not statistically significant. Ten of 52 subjects (19.2%) met the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rome III version criteria for diagnosis of an FGID (7 irritable bowel syndrome, 2 functional dyspepsia, 1 functional abdominal pain), whereas none in the control group did. CONCLUSIONS: CMA constitutes a risk factor for the development of FGIDs in children.},

Normally, between this flora and the human host a mutually beneficial long-term symbiotic relationship is established, where the host contributes essential nutrients necessary for the survival of the microbiota and the latter fulfils multiple roles in host nutrition and development. Several achievements have recently converged to renew interest in studying the normal gut microbiota: the development of molecular methods of studying the microbial communities, the improved understanding of host-microbe interactions in health and disease, and the potential for therapeutic manipulation of the microbiota. We present recent data concerning the molecular technologies of studying the microbiota and new findings regarding the composition of the normal flora. We underline the beneficial activities of the gut flora on the human host. We emphasize the recent findings in the alterations of the microbiota in various medical conditions (celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, colorectal cancer, allergic disorders, and especially inflammatory bowel diseases). The results of these new studies suggest that changes of the microbiota could be linked to the etiopathogenesis of these diseases. These outstanding findings could be used for further diagnostic tools and/or therapy.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the relevant publications during the last 12 months supporting that diet can influence gas-related symptoms in the absence of a malabsorption state. RECENT FINDINGS: Gas symptoms during carbohydrate fermentation: a diet incorporating beans is well tolerated by a majority of individuals involved in a program of heart disease biomarkers. By contrast, in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, a diet avoiding fermentable carbohydrates improved gas-related abdominal symptoms. The rate of fermentation determines the production of abdominal symptoms, and many slowly fermentable fibers have a rapid fermentation profile that can generate abdominal symptoms. Modulation of visceral sensitivity: diet can influence gas symptoms by increasing the tolerability of the intestine to gas. Capsaicin decreases visceral hyperalgesia and improved bloating in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Changes in gas-producing bacteria: different strains of Lactobacillus have antimicrobial properties against gas-forming coliforms. New clinical studies show beneficial effects of prebiotics and probiotics on abdominal bloating. SUMMARY: Actual data suggest that diet could improve gas-related abdominal symptoms acting on several mechanisms: gas production, visceral hypersensitivity and modulation of gas-producing enteric bacteria.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: To study the prevalence of somatic and psychiatric co-morbidities in the patients of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and to assess the quality of life (QOL) of these patients. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-four IBS patients and 198 controls were included. Diagnosis of IBS, its sub-classification and assessment of other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) was made on basis of Rome III criteria. Severity of IBS was assessed using IBS severity scoring system. Psychiatric evaluation was done using Patient Heath Questionnaire. QOL was evaluated using WHO QOL-BREF. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-seven (79.9%) and 158 (85.9%) patients with IBS had at least one other FGID or at least one somatic co-morbidity, respectively. Higher number of patients had at least one psychiatric co-morbidity compared to controls (79.9% vs 34.3%; P < 0.001). Major depressive syndrome (47.3% vs 5.1%; P < 0.001), somatoform disorder (50% vs 14.6%; P < 0.001) and panic syndrome (44% vs 11.6%; P < 0.001) were more common in IBS than controls. Only 14 (7.6%) patients were receiving drug treatment for their psychiatric illness. Severe IBS symptoms were present in significantly higher number of patients with constipation predominant IBS than diarrhea predominant IBS. Those with severe disease had higher prevalence of psychiatric (95.1%) and somatic (96.7%) co-morbidities compared with mild disease. QOL of IBS patients was significantly lower in all four domains compared to controls. Presence of at least one other FGID was significantly associated with presence of one or more psychiatric co-morbidity (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Majority of IBS patients presenting to a tertiary care center had associated psychiatric, somatic co-morbidities and reduced QOL. Very few of them received specific psychiatric treatment.},

   abstract = {Preliminary studies indicate that dietary restriction of fermentable short-chain carbohydrates improves symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Prebiotic fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides stimulate colonic bifidobacteria. However, the effect of restricting fermentable short-chain carbohydrates on the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota has never been examined. This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the effects of fermentable carbohydrate restriction on luminal microbiota, SCFA, and GI symptoms in patients with IBS. Patients with IBS were randomized to the intervention diet or habitual diet for 4 wk. The incidence and severity of symptoms and stool output were recorded for 7 d at baseline and follow-up. A stool sample was collected and analyzed for bacterial groups using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Of 41 patients randomized, 6 were withdrawn. At follow-up, there was lower intake of total short-chain fermentable carbohydrates in the intervention group compared with controls (P = 0.001). The total luminal bacteria at follow-up did not differ between groups; however, there were lower concentrations (P < 0.001) and proportions (P < 0.001) of bifidobacteria in the intervention group compared with controls when adjusted for baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, more patients in the intervention group reported adequate control of symptoms (13/19, 68%) compared with controls (5/22, 23%; P = 0.005). This randomized controlled trial demonstrated a reduction in concentration and proportion of luminal bifidobacteria after 4 wk of fermentable carbohydrate restriction. Although the intervention was effective in managing IBS symptoms, the implications of its effect on the GI microbiota are still to be determined.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence indicates that the consumption of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) may result in symptoms in some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The present study aimed to determine whether a low FODMAP diet is effective for symptom control in patients with IBS and to compare its effects with those of standard dietary advice based on the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines. METHODS: Consecutive patients with IBS who attended a follow-up dietetic outpatient visit for dietary management of their symptoms were included. Questionnaires were completed for patients who received standard (n = 39) or low FODMAP dietary advice (n = 43). Data were recorded on symptom change and comparisons were made between groups. RESULTS: In total, more patients in the low FODMAP group reported satisfaction with their symptom response (76%) compared to the standard group (54%, P = 0.038). Composite symptom score data showed better overall symptom response in the low FODMAP group (86%) compared to the standard group (49%, P < 0.001). Significantly more patients in the low FODMAP group compared to the standard group reported improvements in bloating (low FODMAP 82% versus standard 49%, P = 0.002), abdominal pain (low FODMAP 85% versus standard 61%, P = 0.023) and flatulence (low FODMAP 87% versus standard 50%, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A low FODMAP diet appears to be more effective than standard dietary advice for symptom control in IBS.},

In a considerable subgroup of these, no underlying cause is identified and this is referred to as functional diarrhea. A consensus definition for functional diarrhea is based on loose stool consistency and chronicity and absence of coexisting irritable bowel syndrome. Underlying pathophysiology includes rapid intestinal transit, which may be worsened by stress or be triggered by a preceding infectious gastroenteritis. Diagnostic work-up aims at exclusion of underlying organic disease. Treatment starts with dietary adjustments, aiming at decreasing nutrients that enhance transit and stool and at identifying precipitating food items.},

With increasing evidence or cumulative evidence, this article reviews the current data for the role of nutrition in IBD pathogenesis, disease exacerbation and its use in the treatment of IBD in a clinically relevant context. RECENT FINDINGS: Irritable bowel syndrome and obesity prevalence is rising, and is increasingly being recognized in patients with IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition remains highly relevant because of its efficacy and superior side-effect profile, even when considered against new pharmacological treatments, but requires patient motivation. We are now beginning to understand the importance of micronutrients such as iron and vitamin D, which may not only alter the bowel flora but also have an immune-modulatory effect. More recently, a prebiotic and probiotic combination has been used in a randomized trial for the treatment of IBD. SUMMARY: Macronutrient and micronutrient assessment should be an essential part of nutritional assessment of all patients with IBD. Although research is needed to further our understanding of the immune-modulatory effects of nutrients and supplements, better and more effective therapies combining nutrition and drug treatments like immune-suppressants should be explored.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Barostat methodology is widely used for assessing visceral perception. Different barostat protocols are described with respect to the measurement of rectal compliance and visceral perception. The choice of protocols affects the duration, which is normally 60-90 min, and accuracy of the procedure. This study aimed to shorten the procedure by using the semi-random distension protocol for both compliance and visceral perception measurement and a correction based on rectal capacity (RC) instead of minimal distension pressure (MDP). METHODS: Twelve irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients (7 females) and 11 healthy controls (8 females) underwent a barostat procedure. Compliance was determined during both a staircase distension and a semi-random protocol. Visceral perception data were compared as a function of pressure or relative volume, corrected for MDP or RC, respectively. RESULTS: Compliance measurement using the semi-random protocol instead of the staircase distension protocol resulted in an overestimation in healthy volunteers, but not in IBS patients. The overall conclusion that IBS patients had a lower compliance compared to controls was not different between protocols. Data presentation of the visceral perception scores as a function of corrected volume instead of pressures corrected for MDP did not alter the conclusion that sensation scores in IBS patients were higher as compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that barostat procedures may be shortened by approximately 20 min, without losing the ability to discriminate between healthy controls and IBS patients. A correction for RC instead of MDP may improve the accuracy of the procedure.},

METHODS: The iterative process included multiphase qualitative methods. A literature review of GI disorders was conducted to generate domains for the focus interviews. Six pediatric gastroenterologists with extensive clinical experience in GI disorders provided expert opinion regarding the conceptual framework. A total of 98 participants, 46 pediatric patients ages 5 to 18, and 52 parents of patients ages 2 to 18 with physician-diagnosed GI disorders (chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease [Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis], gastroesophageal reflux disease), participated in the focus interviews and cognitive interviewing phases, including think-aloud and cognitive debriefing protocols. RESULTS: Eleven domains were derived from the qualitative methods involving patient and parent interviews and expert opinion, with content saturation achieved, resulting in 76 items. The 11 domains consisted of items measuring stomach pain, stomach upset, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, gas and bloating, constipation, diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative methods involving pediatric patients and their parents in the item generation process support the content validity for the new PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module. The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module is undergoing national multisite field testing as the next iterative phase.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in our ability to identify and characterize the human microbiota have transformed our appreciation of the function of the colon from an organ principally involved in the reabsorption of secretory fluids to a metabolic organ on a par with the liver. High-throughput technology has been applied to the identification of specific differences in microbial DNA, allowing the identification of trillions of microbes belonging to more than 1000 different species, with a metabolic mass of approximately 1.5 kg. The close proximity of these microbes with the mucosa and gut lymphoid tissue helps explain why a balanced microbiota is likely to preserve mucosal health, whereas an unbalanced composition, as seen in dysbiosis, may increase the prevalence of diseases not only of the mucosa but also within the body due to the strong interactions with the gut immune system, the largest immune organ of the body. Such abnormalities have been pinpointed as etiological factors in a wide range of diseases, including autoimmune disorders, allergy, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and colon cancer. Recognition of the strong potential for food to manipulate microbiota composition has opened up new therapeutic strategies against these diseases based on dietary intervention.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, about which there has been considerable recent research. The aim of this article is to briefly review the aspects of IBS pathogenesis that involve the gastrointestinal microbiota, and then to critically appraise the recent and emerging evidence for the use of probiotics and prebiotics in its management. RECENT FINDINGS: The increased risk of developing IBS following gastroenteritis and the co-existence of dysbiosis, elevated luminal gas production and immune activation, indicate that the gastrointestinal microbiota may be a therapeutic target in IBS. Most systematic reviews indicate that probiotics have a beneficial impact on global IBS symptoms, abdominal pain and flatulence. However, recent trials indicate that different probiotics can improve, have no effect, or even worsen symptoms, confirming that benefits are likely to be strain and symptom-specific. There are no recent clinical trials of prebiotics in IBS, although previous studies indicate potential benefit at lower doses. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics have considerable potential in the management of IBS; however, the benefits are likely to be strain-specific. Preliminary studies suggest low doses of prebiotics may improve symptoms of IBS, although further robust clinical trials are required.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterised by episodes of abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits. Many IBS sufferers believe that diet may play a role in triggering these episodes and may avoid certain foods. However relatively few studies have undertaken a dietary assessment in IBS sufferers to examine the wider impact of the condition upon diet. METHODS: 104 individuals with IBS were recruited and asked to complete a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The data were analysed against Dietary Reference Values for food energy and nutrients for the United Kingdom and observed intakes for the general population and for differences between IBS subtypes and the UK population. RESULTS: The data show that the dietary intakes of this population of IBS sufferers met the UK Dietary Reference Values. The average energy intake of the population exceeded the Estimated Average Requirements of the UK population and the balance of macronutrients was favourable. Intakes of selected micronutrients significantly exceeded the reference nutrient intakes. There were no differences between IBS subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The IBS subpopulation appear to have an adequate and balanced macronutrient intake with no evidence of inadequate micronutrient intake.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we explored the prevalence rates and association factors of functional gastrointestinal disorders and the most common modes and frequencies of bowel habit among a cohort of Chinese adolescents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A stratified, randomized study based on cross-sectional data was performed using cluster sampling, which recruited 3671 students in Shanghai, China. All of the students were requested to complete a questionnaire. RESULTS: Overall, 88.05% +/- 0.28% of students had a bowel movement frequency of between 1 of 2 times per day and once every 2 days. Female students were found to have a lower bowel frequency than boys (P < 0.01). The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional constipation, and functional diarrhea were 19.89%, 24.93%, and 5.42%, respectively. Certain factors adjusted for age and sex were significantly associated with IBS (P < 0.05), including gastrointestinal tract infection (odds ratio [OR] 2.26), abuse of analgesics (OR 1.25), air swallowing to terminate hiccups (OR 1.28), fatigue (OR 1.15), and depression (OR 1.36). Other factors that were adjusted for age and sex, such as fried food (OR 1.68), air swallowing to terminate hiccups (OR 1.21), anxiety (OR 1.12), and depression (OR 1.57), were significantly associated with the presence of functional constipation (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: : Our findings suggest that normal bowel frequency among Chinese urban adolescents may be defined as between 1 or 2 bowel movements per day and once every 2 days. IBS, functional constipation, and diarrhea are common disorders among this adolescent group.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common gastrointestinal disorder, affecting more than 10% of the general population worldwide. Although a genetic component is suspected, unambiguous susceptibility genes have so far not been identified. This study tested the hypothesis that genes contributing to epithelial barrier integrity, control of mucosal immune responses and interactions with bacteria in the gut are associated with IBS. METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) corresponding to top signals of association with Crohn's disease at 30 known susceptibility loci were tested for their effect on IBS risk in 1992 individuals from two independent case-control cohorts from Sweden and the USA. Association tests included a conservative Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, and were also performed on specific subgroups of patients characterised by constipation (IBS-C), diarrhoea (IBS-D) or alternating constipation and diarrhoea (IBS-A). RESULTS: The Crohn's disease risk allele rs4263839 G in the TNFSF15 gene was significantly associated with an increased risk of both IBS (p=2.2x10(-5); OR 1.37) and more pronouncedly, IBS-C (p=8.7x10(-7); OR 1.79) in the entire sample. Similar associations and risk effects of the same magnitude were observed in the two cohorts analysed separately. A correlation between rs4263839 genotype and TNFSF15 mRNA expression was detected both in peripheral blood and in rectal mucosal biopsies from healthy individuals (combined p=0.0033). CONCLUSIONS: TNFSF15 is a susceptibility gene for IBS and IBS constipation. As TL1A, the protein encoded by TNFSF15, contributes to the modulation of inflammatory responses, the results support a role of immune activation in IBS.},
