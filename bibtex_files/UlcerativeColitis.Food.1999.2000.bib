   abstract = {It has been postulated that patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have altered reactivity of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. In such cases there is intense infiltration of the mucosa with immune competent cells and associated tissue damage. We have shown previously that the dietary supplementation with the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) results in significant systemic immune suppression. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the in situ effect of n-3 PUFAs on distal proctocolitis. Each patient received either fish oil extract (EPA 3.2 g, DHA 2.4 g) (n = 9) or sunflower oil (n = 9) daily in a double blind manner for six months. Monthly assessment included: (1) disease activity using clinical, sigmoidoscopic, and histological scores and (2) immunohistochemical analysis (immunoglobulins, CD profiles) of rectal biopsy specimens (before and after six months supplementation) using monoclonal antibodies and quantitative computer-assisted video image analysis. Prior to receiving supplementation, patients with proctocolitis (n = 18) showed significantly higher numbers of cells expressing CD3 (pan T cells) and HLA-DR and IgM containing cells compared with non-colitic controls (n = 8). Six months supplementation with n-3 PUFAs resulted in significant reduction in the number of cells expressing CD3 and HLA and the percentage of cells containing IgM. There was no significant change in the CD20 nor the percentage of IgG or IgA containing cells in either group of patients with procto-colitis. In patients receiving n-3 PUFA supplementation, there was improvement in the disease activity and histological scores, compared with pretreatment evaluation. This study has demonstrated both evidence of suppression of in situ immune reactivity and concurrent reduction in disease activity in patients with proctocolitis receiving n-3 PUFA supplementation. This may have important implication for therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {The rationale for supplementation with n-3 fatty acids to promote the health of the gastrointestinal tract lies in the antiinflammatory effects of these lipid compounds. The first evidence of the importance of dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids was derived from epidemiologic observations of the low incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Eskimos. The aim of this paper was to briefly review the literature on the use of n-3 fatty acids in inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease), the results of which are controversial. The discrepancies between studies may reside in the different study designs used as well as in the various formulations and dosages used, some of which may lead to a high incidence of side effects. Choosing a formulation that lowers the incidence of side effects, selecting patients carefully, and paying strict attention to experimental design are critical when investigating further the therapeutic potential of these lipids in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Starches are important as energy sources for humans and also for their interactions with the gut microflora throughout the digestive tact. Largely, those interactions promote human health. In the mouth, less gelatinised starches may lower risk of cariogensis. In the large bowel, starches which have escaped small intestinal digestion (resistant starch), together with proteins, other undigested carbohydrates and endogenous secretions are fermented by the resident microflora. The resulting short chain fatty acids contribute substantially to the normal physiological functions of the viscera. Specific types of resistant starch (e.g. the chemically modified starches used in the food industry) may be used to manipulate the gut bacteria and their products (including short chain fatty acids) so as to optimise health. In the upper gut, these starches may assist in the transport of probiotic organisms thus promoting the immune response and suppressing potential pathogens. However, it appears unlikely that current probiotic organisms can be used to modulate large bowel short chain fatty acids in adults although resistant starch and other prebiotics can do so. Suggestions that starch may exacerbate certain conditions (such as ulcerative colitis) through stimulating the growth of certain pathogenic organisms appear to be unfounded. Short chain fatty acids may modulate tissue levels and effects of growth factors in the gut and so modify gut development and risk of serious disease, including colo-rectal cancer. However, information on the relationship between starches and the microflora is relatively sparse and substantial opportunities exist both for basic research and food product development.},

   abstract = {There have frequently been doubts as to the relevance of food allergy, in particular as far as the involvement of the intestinal tract is concerned. Several studies, however, have confirmed the existence of allergic reactions in the gut, with an estimated prevalence of about 1-2% in adults. Clinical symptoms are unspecific and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping and diarrhea. Intestinal mast cells, as well as intestinal eosinophils, have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of food-allergy-related enteropathy. In addition to classical IgE-dependent degranulation, further agonists have been demonstrated for mast cell activation, for example IL-4. The methods used to confirm the diagnosis of intestinal allergy are still insufficient. Until now, blinded oral challenge procedures with food antigens have been accepted as the 'gold standard' in diagnosing food allergy, although these tests have practical problems. Therefore, new test systems have been developed, such as endoscopic provocation tests, that may improve diagnostic procedures. Elimination diet still presents the main basis of therapy. Aspects to be focused on in the future are the role fo IgE-independent allergic mechanisms in intestinal allergy, the impact of cross-reactivity with other allergens and the relationship to other inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antisecretory factor (AF), a 41 kDa cloned and sequenced protein, suppresses intestinal inflammation and hypersecretion in animals. Endogenous AF production can be induced by dietary modifications in several animal species, and this feed has been shown to reduce the incidence of diarrhoeal disease in weaning piglets. The role of AF in intestinal disease in humans is not known. AIMS: To study the effects of hydrothermally processed cereals, optimised for AF induction in animals, added to the diet of patients with longstanding symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PATIENTS: Fifty three patients with IBD (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) were entered into the study, and 50 completed follow up. The experimental group consisted of 16 females (mean age 50 (SEM 5) years) and 10 males (41 (4) years) and the placebo group of 12 women (41 (4) years old) and 12 men (51 (5) years). METHODS: Patients were randomised to receive either hydrothermally processed cereals (active treatment) or the same amount of ordinary cereals (placebo treatment) for four weeks in a double blind study design. Baseline diet and medications remained unchanged. Bowel symptoms, plasma levels of AF, and colonic biopsies were evaluated before and after treatment. RESULTS: The active treatment significantly improved subjective ratings of clinical symptoms and increased plasma AF levels compared with placebo. Plasma lipid levels were unaffected. CONCLUSION: Hydrothermally processed cereals can induce AF production in human IBD. This increase in endogenous AF activity is associated with clinical improvement. Further studies are warranted to clarify the exact role of AF in human intestinal disease.},

Spacer regions between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes (ITS) of the three strains were amplified by PCR with conserved primers and the nucleotide sequence of these ITSs were determined. On the basis of their comparison with the rDNA sequences retrieved from GenBank, we designed new primers which specifically recognize the species B. breve and the two strains B. infantis Y 1 and B. breve Y 8. Specificity of these primers was confirmed through the analysis of 60 bifidobacteria strains belonging to the more representative human species. The feasibility of this PCR method was investigated in commercial VSL-3 product and fecal samples collected from 4 patients affected by inflammatory bowel deseases and two healthy subjects before and after the VSL-3 administration. By PCR analysis of different VSL-3 commercial batches we were successful in differentiating and quantifying the strains B. longum Y 10, B. infantis Y 1 and B. breve Y 8. B. infantis Y 1 and B. breve Y 8 could be detected at high concentration in fecal specimens of both patients and subjects treated with the probiotic preparation, showing a different colonization behaviour. Seven days after the VSL-3 treatment suspension, no patients and subjects harbored B. infantis Y 1 and B. breve Y 8, indicating a transient presence of these exogenous strains.},

   abstract = {Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the end products of anaerobic bacteria break down of carbohydrates in the large bowel. This process, namely fermentation, is an important function of the large bowel; SCFAs, mainly acetate, propionate and butyrate account for approximately 80% of the colonic anion concentration and are produced in nearly constant molar ratio 60:25:15. Among their various properties, SCFAs are readily absorbed by intestinal mucosa, are relatively high in caloric content, are metabolized by colonocytes and epatocytes, stimulate sodium and water absorption in the colon and are trophic to the intestinal mucosa. While the fermentative production of SCFAs has been acknowledged as a principal mechanism of intestinal digestion in ruminants, the interest in the effects of SCFAs production on the human organism has been raising in the last ten years. SCFAs are of major importance in understanding the physiological function of dietary fibers and their possible role in intestinal neoplasia. SCFAs production and absorption are closely related to the nourishment of colonic mucosa, its production from dietary carbohydrates is a mechanism whereby considerable amounts of calories can be produced in short-bowel patients with remaining colonic function and kept on an appropriate dietary regimen. SCFAs enemas or oral probiotics are a new and promising treatment for ulcerative colitis. The effects have been attributed to the oxidation of SCFAs in the colonocytes and to the ability of butyrate to induce enzymes (i.e. transglutaminase) promoting mucosal restitution. Evidence is mounting regarding the effects of butyrate on various cell functions the significance of which needs further considerations. Up until now, attention has been related especially to cancer prophylaxis and treatment. This article briefly reviews the role of SCFAs, particularly butyrate, in intestinal mucosal growth and potential clinical applications in inflammatory and neoplastic processes of the large bowel.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data on allergy in ulcerative colitis (UC) have led to conflicting conclusions without proving any causal association. In this report we have investigated the presence of allergy and its possible relation with chronic colonic inflammation in patients with UC. METHODS: Fifty UC patients underwent clinical, endoscopic, and histologic evaluations. The allergologic study included family/personal history; prick/patch exposition to airborne, food, and contact allergens; total serum IgE; and quantification of eosinophils in peripheral blood and intestinal mucosa. Diagnosis of rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma was confirmed by specific provocation tests. Fifty healthy subjects were studied as control group. RESULTS: A higher prevalence of allergic symptoms was found in patients (56%) and their first-degree relatives (52%) than in controls (18% and 26%) (P < 0.0001; P = 0.008). In patients skin tests showed increased rates of immediate (54%) and delayed-type (20%) hypersensitivity compared with controls (30% and 6%) (P= 0.01; P= 0.03). Diagnosis of allergic IgE-mediated disease was made in 19 cases and 6 controls (P= 0.01), and allergic contact dermatitis in 10 and 3, respectively (P= 0.03). IgE levels were higher in UC patients than in controls (P=0.02). No dose-response relationship was found between degree of colonic tissue eosinophilia and clinical. endoscopic, and histologic disease severity. The degree of colonic tissue eosinophilia was higher in the presence of skin reactivity to food allergens. CONCLUSIONS: UC patients frequently show several markers of allergy. In particular, our data suggest an association between ulcerative colitis, tissue eosinophilia, and type-I allergy.},

   abstract = {Slow release oral mesalazine (Pentasa) contains microgranules covered by a semipermeable ethylcellulose membrane. The microgranules continuously release their content from duodenum to ileum in a pH- and time-dependent way. About 75% of the microgranules pass into the colon, where further release is slower. This release pattern does not appear to be affected by food, diarrhoea or the simultaneous use of H2 antagonists. Rectal forms of mesalazine deliver active drug directly to the rectum and left colon. Plasma concentrations of mesalazine and its metabolite acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid after oral or local administration are the result of systemic absorption and hepatic metabolism by N-acetyltransferase. Most studies report maximal plasma concentrations of less than 1 mg/L after oral administration of slow release mesalazine, much lower than those observed after uncoated mesalazine but generally higher than after azo-bound drugs such as sulfasalazine. Urinary recovery is an indicator of absorption and metabolism, and is lower after rectal administration (10 to 30%) than after oral administration (30 to 40%). Faecal recovery after oral administration of slow or delayed release mesalazine is lower than with azo-bound drugs. Mesalazine acts locally after absorption by colonic and ileal mucosa. Mean steady-state concentrations of 25.7+/-2.2 microg/kg wet weight are found in ileocolonic biopsy specimens from patients with irritable bowel syndrome treated for 1 week with slow release mesalazine 1.5 g/day. Intramucosal concentrations after slow release mesalazine differ little between healthy individuals and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Although significant differences are found between the various aminosalicylates in release patterns and the resulting pharmacokinetic parameters, no differences in therapeutic effects have been found in comparative studies. High doses of oral mesalazine (2 to 4 g/day) are more effective than lower doses in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis. High doses (4 g/day) are also effective in the treatment of Crohn's disease, predominantly in patients with ileitis. In contrast, no dose ranging effects were demonstrated with local treatment forms: mesalazine 1g enema seems sufficient for patients with distal colitis. Higher serum concentrations and urinary recoveries after the administration of slow or delayed release mesalazine compared with azo-bound drugs suggest a higher risk for renal adverse effects, although the reported occurrence is extremely low. Although preliminary data support an association between mucosal concentrations of mesalazine and its clinical activity, further studies are needed to correlate the effects of this drug with its pharmacokinetic parameters.},

Studies performed with E. coli Nissle 1917 demonstrated that this bacterium can positively affect the course of disease in UC and CD patients. The clinical efficacy of probiotics can yield valuable information about disease pathogenesis and, as a modification of current standard therapy, opens new and interesting therapeutic alternatives.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study cholesterol absorption and excretion in ileostomy subjects with different intakes of saturated fat and dietary fibre. DESIGN: Short-term experimental study, with four controlled diets in repeated measurements. SETTING: Out-patients at metabolic-ward kitchen. SUBJECTS: Nine healthy volunteers with conventional ileostomy after colectomy because of ulcerative colitis. INTERVENTIONS: Four diet periods, each of 3 days duration: high saturated fat and low dietary fibre (STAND); reduced saturated fat (RESAT); high saturated fat and high fibre (FATFIB); and reduced saturated fat and high fibre (RESATFIB). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Absorption of cholesterol, and ileal excretion of cholesterol, bile acids, fat and energy. Differences between diets evaluated with Friedman's two-way analysis of variance by rank sum with Bonferroni adjustment, and post hoc differences assessed by rank sum comparison. RESULTS: RESAT and RESATFIB reduced fractional cholesterol absorption by 7% and 10%; RESATFIB and FATFIB increased net cholesterol excretion by 46% and 54% respectively. Further, RESATFIB increased net sterol excretion by 18%, all compared to STAND (P<0.05 for all). All three intervention diets contained more phytosterols than STAND (P<0.05), and the phytosterol content was inversely correlated to fractional cholesterol absorption (r=-0.77, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Current nutrition recommendations to reduce saturated fat and increase dietary fibre affect sterol excretion additively. The effect on cholesterol absorption might be partly explained by the content of dietary plant sterols.

   abstract = {Energy-protein malnutrition and the sub-clinical deficiencies of vitamins and trace elements, are frequent findings in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and these may negatively influence the clinical course of these diseases. In general, the majority of the patients with ulcerative colitis and uncomplicated Crohn's disease can ingest a normal diet that is well balanced and without any restrictions. The intolerance to specific foods is rare in Crohn's disease and the application of exclusion diets in a routine manner is not indicated. When the nutritional status cannot be adequately maintained with normal ingestion, the use of artificial nutrition is indicated. Enteral nutrition is the first choice nutritional support system if the gastrointestinal tract is accessible and at least partially functional. In Crohn's disease enteral nutrition could have a specific anti-inflammatory effect ("primary treatment"), and it has been suggested that this could be effective to induce the clinical remission of the activity bouts of the disease. Some types of dietary fiber could be effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Initial studies suggest their usefulness in maintaining the remission of the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Butyrate enemas may be effective in the treatment of active distal ulcerative colitis. Because colonic fermentation of Plantago ovata seeds (dietary fiber) yields butyrate, the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of Plantago ovata seeds as compared with mesalamine in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. METHODS: An open label, parallel-group, multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted. A total of 105 patients with ulcerative colitis who were in remission were randomized into groups to receive oral treatment with Plantago ovata seeds (10 g b.i.d.), mesalamine (500 mg t.i.d.), and Plantago ovata seeds plus mesalamine at the same doses. The primary efficacy outcome was maintenance of remission for 12 months. RESULTS: Of the 105 patients, 102 were included in the final analysis. After 12 months, treatment failure rate was 40% (14 of 35 patients) in the Plantago ovata seed group, 35% (13 of 37) in the mesalamine group, and 30% (nine of 30) in the Plantago ovata plus mesalamine group. Probability of continued remission was similar (Mantel-Cox test, p = 0.67; intent-to-treat analysis). Therapy effects remained unchanged after adjusting for potential confounding variables with a Cox's proportional hazards survival analysis. Three patients were withdrawn because of the development of adverse events consisting of constipation and/or flatulence (Plantago ovata seed group = 1 and Plantago ovata seed plus mesalamine group = 2). A significant increase in fecal butyrate levels (p = 0.018) was observed after Plantago ovata seed administration. CONCLUSIONS: Plantago ovata seeds (dietary fiber) might be as effective as mesalamine to maintain remission in ulcerative colitis.},

Knowledge of the nutritional status in patients with recently diagnosed IBD is limited. The aim of this study was to establish a comprehensive picture of the nutritional status in recently diagnosed IBD patients. SUBJECTS: Sixty-nine IBD patients (23 Crohn's disease (CD) and 46 with ulcerative colitis (UC)) within 6 months of diagnosis and 69 age- and sex-matched population controls were included in the study. METHODS: The nutritional status was assessed by: (1) body composition (anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry); (2) dietary intake (dietary history); (3) biochemical indexes of nutrition; and (4) muscle strength (isokinetic dynamometer). RESULTS: Body weight and body mass index were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. The mean daily intake of carbohydrates was significantly higher in CD patients and the intakes of protein, calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls, respectively. Serum concentrations of several nutrients (beta-carotene, magnesium, selenium and zinc) were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. Serum vitamin B12 concentration was significantly lower in CD patients. Muscle strength did not significantly differ between IBD patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the nutritional status of IBD patients was already affected negatively at time of diagnosis. It needs to be elucidated whether nutritional supplementation in recently diagnosed IBD patients may improve the clinical course of the disease.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the etiological role of dietary factors in the development of UC. METHODS: Recently diagnosed (<6 Months) UC patients (n = 43) and age- and gender-matched population controls (n = 43) were studied in a case-control design. The crosscheck dietary history method was used to assess dietary intake of 5 yr before the study. Adipose tissue fatty acid composition was used as a biomarker of long-term fat intake. Conditional logistic regression-derived odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used for statistical analysis. Dietary intake ORs were adjusted for energy intake. RESULTS: High intakes of monounsaturated fat (OR: 33.9 [95% CI 2.6-443.1]), polyunsaturated fat (OR: 5.1 [95% CI 1.0-26.7]), and vitamin B6 (OR: 6.9 [95% CI 1.6-30.7]) were associated with an increased risk to develop UC. No other significant associations were found with UC risk. CONCLUSIONS: High intakes of mono- and polyunsaturated fat and vitamin B6 may enhance the risk of developing UC. Whether this observation is a true risk factor in the development of UC or rather a reflection of a certain dietary lifestyle needs to be investigated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pouchitis is the major long-term complication after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. Most patients have relapsing disease, and no maintenance treatment study has been performed. We evaluated the efficacy of a probiotic preparation (VSL#3) containing 5 x 10(11) per gram of viable lyophilized bacteria of 4 strains of lactobacilli, 3 strains of bifidobacteria, and 1 strain of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus compared with placebo in maintenance of remission of chronic pouchitis. METHODS: Forty patients in clinical and endoscopic remission were randomized to receive either VSL#3, 6 g/day, or an identical placebo for 9 months. Patients were assessed clinically every month and endoscopically and histologically every 2 months or in the case of a relapse. Fecal samples were collected for stool culture before and after antibiotic treatment and each month during maintenance treatment. RESULTS: Three patients (15%) in the VSL#3 group had relapses within the 9-month follow-up period, compared with 20 (100%) in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Fecal concentration of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and S. thermophilus increased significantly from baseline levels only in the VSL#3-treated group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that oral administration of this new probiotic preparation is effective in preventing flare-ups of chronic pouchitis.},

In the present study we determined in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha liberated by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) after 48-hr culture with pokeweed mitogen (PWM). IL-1beta, IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in the supernatant were detected by ELISA. Results show low basal levels of IL-1beta secretion by PBMC and LPMC, and a considerable increase after mitogen stimulation. Basal IL-6 production by PBMC was higher in UC patients than in controls [2029 pg/ml, CI95(-165 to 4223) vs 572 pg/ml (-383 to 1527) respectively, P = 0.05] and also after PWM activation [14,995 pg/ml (7759-22,230) vs 6598 pg/ml (3240-9956), respectively, P = 0.05]. In LPMC, no differences in IL-6 secretion were observed. TNF-alpha in activated PBMC of patients with UC was not significantly increased in relation to control (P = 0.09). No constitutive secretion of IFN-gamma was observed in mononuclear cells. IFN-gamma levels secreted by activated LPMC were lower in patients with UC than in controls [1571 pg/ml (-108 to 3251) vs 7953 pg/ml (3851-12,055), respectively, P = 0.03]. These results suggest that IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha participate as mediators in the inflammatory phenomena observed in UC. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the role of IFN-gamma in this condition.},

   abstract = {These studies were performed to test the benefit of resistant starch on ulcerative colitis via prebiotic and butyrate effects. Butyrate, propionate, and acetate are produced in the colon of mammals as a result of microbial fermentation of resistant starch and other dietary fibers. Butyrate plays an important role in the colonic mucosal growth and epithelial proliferation. A reduction in the colonic butyrate level induces chronic mucosal atrophy. Short-chain fatty acid enemas increase mucosal generation, crypt length, and DNA content of the colonocytes. They also ameliorate symptoms of ulcerative colitis in human patients and rats injected with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Butyrate, and also to a lesser degree propionate, are substrates for the aerobic energy metabolism, and trophic factors of the colonocytes. Adverse butyrate effects occur in normal and neoplastic colonic cells. In normal cells, butyrate induces proliferation at the crypt base, while inhibiting proliferation at the crypt surface. In neoplastic cells, butyrate inhibits DNA synthesis and arrests cell growth in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The improvement of the TNBS-induced colonic inflammation occurred earlier in the resistant starch (RS)-fed rats than in the RS-free group. This benefit coincided with activation of colonic epithelial cell proliferation and the subsequent restoration of apoptosis. The noncollagenous basement membrane protein laminin was regenerated initially in the RS-fed group, demonstrating what could be a considered lower damage to the intestinal barrier function. The calculation of intestinal short-chain fatty acid absorption confirmed this conclusion. The uptake of short-chain fatty acids in the colon is strongly inhibited in the RS-free group, but only slightly reduced in the animals fed with RS. Additionally, RS enhanced the growth of intestinal bacteria assumed to promote health. Further studies involving patients suffering from ulcerative colitis are necessary to determine the importance of RS in the therapy of a number of intestinal diseases and the maintenance of health.},

   abstract = {Initially, it was hoped that resistant starches (ie, starches that enter the colon) would have clear advantages in the reduction of colon cancer risk and possibly the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Recent studies have confirmed the ability of resistant starch to increase fecal bulk, to increase the molar ratio of butyrate in relation to other short-chain fatty acids, and to dilute fecal bile acids. However, reduction in fecal ammonia, phenols, and N-nitroso compounds have not been achieved. At this point the picture from the standpoint of colon cancer risk reduction is not clear. Nevertheless, there is a fraction of what has been termed resistant starch (RS1), which enters the colon and acts as slowly digested, or lente, carbohydrate. Foods in this class are low glycemic index and have been shown to reduce the risk of chronic disease. They have been associated with systemic physiologic effects such as reduced postprandial insulin levels and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Consumption of low glycemic index foods has been shown to be related to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes has in turn been related to a higher risk of colon cancer, especially colon cancer deaths. If carbohydrate has a protective role in colon cancer prevention, it may lie in the systemic effects of low glycemic index foods. The colonic advantages of different carbohydrates, therefore, remain to be documented. However, there is reason for optimism about the possible health advantages of so-called resistant starches that are slowly digested in the small intestine.},

   abstract = {Anecdotally, people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report that some foods make them feel better and some foods make them feel worse. This paper reports about the relationship between food habits and reactions to foods in people with IBD. A database was designed to incorporate the date of data collection, the IBD disease, food habits, the quantity consumed and a response rating of the subjects' reactions to each food. For each of 122 foods, subjects were asked simultaneously about these five categories. Thirty three subjects with Crohn's disease and 27 with ulcerative colitis completed the questionnaire in two seasons. The focus of the examination was directed to the upper and lower limit of reactions to foods. Foods that affect people negatively and foods that affect people positively were identified in relation to habits of consumption. Foods that affect people negatively were among those never consumed while foods that affect people positively were among the regularly consumed foods. Findings included an increased number of foods that caused problems for people with Crohn's disease when compared with people with ulcerative colitis. Problems with chocolate, dairy products, fats and artificial sweeteners were documented in both groups of IBD. A standard food list generated without the input of individuals with a chronic illness may be inadequate to collect data about their consumption since many of the foods on the list were reportedly never consumed and there may be other foods not on the list that are consumed by this chronically ill population.},

A database was created to capture the season of data collection, the disease, the food, and the subject's reaction to each food. A 122-item food list was used. Sixty patients with IBD (n = 33 persons with Crohn's disease, n = 27 persons with ulcerative colitis) completed the questionnaire about foods and their reactions to the foods in the fall and spring representing summer and winter consumption. Foods that made the subjects feel better and worse were identified. Although the original purpose of the study was to assess people with IBD as a group, it became apparent that reactions to foods were different according to whether a subject had Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Failure to distinguish between the two diseases and use only the pooled data made the data meaningless. The importance of this finding and themes related to foods that had a positive or negative effect on the subjects is discussed in this article.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Germinated barley foodstuffs (GBF), which are derived from brewer's spent grain and are a highly safe food substance, increased butyrate production in the lower intestine and prevented mucosal damage and bloody diarrhoea in an acute experimental colitis model. As human histocompatibility leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 transgenic rats develop spontaneous and chronic intestinal inflammation resembling ulcerative colitis, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the preventive effects of GBF against a spontaneous and chronic colitis model. Specifically, the production of bacterial butyrate and the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production were examined. METHODS: A GBF diet and a cellulose (CE) diet were fed to HLA-B27 transgenic rats for 13 weeks. The presence of faecal occult blood, colonic mucosal protein, DNA and RNA content, colonic myeloperoxidase activity, nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) DNA binding activity, the depth of the crypts and serum inflammatory parameters were then evaluated. Butyrate production in the caecal contents was also determined. RESULTS: Feeding GBF significantly increased bacterial butyrate production and simultaneously attenuated the presence of faecal occult blood and colonic mucosal hyperplasia. Colonic mucosal NFkappaB-DNA binding activity and the production of interleukin-8 were also suppressed by the butyrate produced from GBF. CONCLUSIONS: Germinated barley foodstuffs feeding promotes bacterial butyrate production and attenuated inflammation in both spontaneous and chronic colitis in HLA-B27 transgenic rats.},

   abstract = {To assess the clinical use of the breath hydrogen test in a large community hospital using a <10 ppm cutoff, we reviewed 222 tests performed over a 5-year period to evaluate patients for disaccharidase deficiency or bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine. Of these, the vast majority (195) were for lactose malabsorption, although fructose (17), sucrose (8) and lactulose (2) were also occasionally administered. One hundred eleven tests (50 percent) were positive, with an increase of at least 10 ppm hydrogen above the fasting level and a maximum value most commonly observed (42.3 percent of the time) at 3 hours post-administration. Only 34 patients (15.3 percent) had symptoms noted during the test, as compared with 185 (83.3 percent) who had experienced persistent intestinal problems prior to the test. Recent conditions which may have caused intestinal distress, such as transient disaccharidase deficiency, infections, surgery or other disorders like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or food poisoning, were recorded in only 14 cases. Patterns consistent with bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine were observed in only 3 cases. Of 111 positives, 9 cases had increases between 10 and 20 ppm hydrogen and 7 showed the increase in the 3-hour sample, possibly reflecting a delayed transit through the intestine. Final diagnoses in 6 of these where information was available were for conditions other than malabsorption. We conclude that using a rise of 10 ppm to interpret a positive test does not contribute significantly to an increased frequency of false positives, but that patients with increases between 10 and 20 ppm probably are not lactase deficient.},

Blood serum of UC patients suffering from combination of food intolerance with dysbacteriosis contained ovalbumin in amounts exceeding those in patients without the above disorders 3.4 times (p < 0.05). No significant relationship existed between UC patients' high intestinal permeability and such indices as age, duration of the disease, intestinal lesion extension, administration of corticosteroids.

   abstract = {IL-5, known to be produced by T lymphocytes and eosinophils, is a key regulator of intestinal diseases such as parasitosis or eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Here we examined if mast cells contribute to the IL-5 production in human intestinal mucosa. The number of IL-5-positive lamina propria cells was substantially higher in patients with intestinal inflammatory diseases (5.3 +/- 4.6%, n = 17) compared to healthy controls (0.5 +/- 0.9%, n = 8, p < 0.01). In patients, the IL-5-positive cells were eosinophils (70 +/- 13%) and mast cells (29 +/- 14%), whereas in controls all IL-5-positive cells were eosinophils. IL-5-positive T cells were not detected, likely because they do not store IL-5. In vitro studies with isolated human intestinal mast cells and eosinophils showed that mast cells do not produce IL-5 constitutively, but release high amounts of IL-5 (315 +/- 115 pg/10(6) cells) following IgE receptor cross-linking, compared to activated eosinophils (24 +/- 5 pg/10(6) cells). Inhibitor studies suggest a regulation of IL-5 production at the transcriptional level. In conclusion our data demonstrate that activated mast cells are a potent source of IL-5 in the human intestinal mucosa.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide is a luminally acting, bacterially derived cell poison that has been implicated in ulcerative colitis. Sulfide generation in the colon is probably driven by dietary components such as sulfur-containing amino acids (SAAs) and inorganic sulfur (eg, sulfite). OBJECTIVE: We assessed the contribution of SAAs from meat to sulfide production by intestinal bacteria with use of both a model culture system in vitro and an in vivo human feeding study. DESIGN: Five healthy men were housed in a metabolic suite and fed a sequence of 5 diets for 10 d each. Meat intake ranged from 0 g/d with a vegetarian diet to 600 g/d with a high-meat diet. Fecal sulfide and urinary sulfate were measured in samples collected on days 9 and 10 of each diet period. Additionally, 5 or 10 g bovine serum albumin or casein/L was added to batch cultures inoculated with feces from 4 healthy volunteers. Concentrations of sulfide, ammonia, and Lowry-reactive substances were measured over 48 h. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SEM) fecal sulfide concentrations ranged from 0.22 +/- 0.02 mmol/kg with the 0-g/d diet to 3.38 +/- 0.31 mmol/kg with the 600-g/d diet and were significantly related to meat intake (P: < 0.001). Sulfide formation in fecal batch cultures supplemented with both bovine serum albumin and casein correlated with protein digestion, as measured by the disappearance of Lowry-reactive substances and the appearance of ammonia. CONCLUSION: Dietary protein from meat is an important substrate for sulfide generation by bacteria in the human large intestine.},

   abstract = {In our ongoing studies on the chemoprevention of cancer we have a particular interest in the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, of which olive oil is a major component. Recent studies have shown that extravirgin olive oil contains an abundance of phenolic antioxidants including simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol), aldehydic secoiridoids, flavonoids and lignans (acetoxypinoresinol, pinoresinol). All of these phenolic substances are potent inhibitors of reactive oxygen species attack on, e.g. salicylic acid, 2-deoxyguanosine. Currently there is growing evidence that reactive oxygen species are involved in the aetiology of fat-related neoplasms such as cancer of the breast and colorectum. A plausible mechanism is a high intake of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are especially prone to lipid peroxidation initiated and propagated by reactive oxygen species, leading to the formation (via alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes such as trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal) of highly pro-mutagenic exocyclic DNA adducts. Previous studies have shown that the colonic mucosa of cancer patients and those suffering from predisposing inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease generates appreciably higher quantities of reactive oxygen species compared with normal tissue. We have extended these studies by developing accurate high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods for the quantitation of reactive oxygen species generated by the faecal matrix. The data shows that the faecal matrix supports the generation of reactive oxygen species in abundance. As yet, there is a dearth of evidence linking this capacity to actual components of the diet which may influence the colorectal milieu. However, using the newly developed methodology we can demonstrate that the antioxidant phenolic compounds present in olive oil are potent inhibitors of free radical generation by the faecal matrix. This indicates that the study of the inter-relation between reactive oxygen species and dietary antioxidants is an area of great promise for elucidating mechanisms of colorectal carcinogenesis and possible future chemopreventive strategies.},

The enzymes were assayed both at the onset of disease symptoms and after treatment with each of five drug regimens (fluconazole and cefadroxil, cefuroxime axetil and cestriaxone sodium, ciprofloxacin and cestriaxone sodium, ciprofloxacin alone, and ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and cephalexin). The activities of azoreductase, nitroreductase, oxidoreductase, glucuronidase, and sulfatase were generally lower following all of the treatments, especially when ciprofloxacin was included. The DNA from each sample was amplified by PCR, using random primers. Profiles of amplified DNA on agarose gels showed different patterns, indicating differences in the microflora before and after the antimicrobial treatments. The clinical response to antibacterial therapy was consistent with the decreased bacterial enzymatic activities and changes in the microbial population. Ciprofloxacin, which was associated with the most dramatic falls in enzymatic activity, also had the best clinical results. We conclude that intestinal bacteria and their enzymes play important roles in ulcerative colitis and that population changes can be monitored using PCR profiles.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis has been suggested to be caused by infection and there is circumstantial evidence linking Escherichia coli with the condition. Our aim was to find out whether the administration of a non-pathogenic strain of E. coli (Nissle 1917) was as effective as mesalazine in preventing relapse of ulcerative colitis. We also examined whether the addition of E. coli to standard medical therapy increased the chance of remission of active ulcerative colitis. METHODS: This was a single-centre, randomised, double-dummy study in which 120 patients with active ulcerative colitis were invited to take part. 116 patients accepted; 59 were randomised to mesalazine and 57 to E. coli. All patients also received standard medical therapy together with a 1-week course of oral gentamicin. After remission, patients were maintained on either mesalazine or E. coli and followed up for a maximum of 12 months. A two-stage, conditional, intention-to-treat analysis was done. FINDINGS: 44 (75%) patients in the mesalazine group attained remission compared with 39 (68%) in the E. coli group. Mean time to remission was 44 days (median 42) in the mesalazine group and 42 days (median 37) for those treated with E. coli. In the mesalazine group, 32 (73%) patients relapsed compared with 26 (67%) in the E. coli group. Mean duration of remission was 206 days in the mesalazine group (median 175) and 221 days (median 185) in the E. coli group. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that treatment with a non-pathogenic E. coli has an equivalent effect to mesalazine in maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis. The beneficial effect of live E. coli may provide clues to the cause of ulcerative colitis.},

Each subject consumed two isoenergetic test meals of contrasting fat-carbohydrate ratio in random order. Emptying of solids was measured using the [13C]octanoic acid breath test, and liquid emptying was assessed after oral dosing with paracetamol. Ileostomist subjects exhibited an increased half-emptying time for solids (P = 0.047), which included components of an increased gastric lag time (P = 0.004) and a reduction in the linear emptying rate (P = 0.003). There was no difference in the pattern of liquid emptying between subject groups. In conclusion, the gastric emptying rate of solids was reduced in ileostomy patients compared with controls.},

Biotechnology agents including a chimeric monoclonal anti-TNF antibody (infliximab), a humanized monoclonal anti-TNF antibody (CDP571), and a recombinant TNF receptor fusion protein (etanercept) have been used to inhibit TNFalpha activity. Controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy for infliximab in moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) and fistulizing CD sufficient to justify recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Additional trials have been completed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Similarly, preliminary controlled trials have suggested efficacy for CDP571 in active CD and RA. Larger controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy for etanercept in RA patients who have failed disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy leading to FDA approval for RA. Toxicities observed with anti-TNF therapies have included formation of human antichimeric antibodies (HACA) with associated acute and delayed hypersensitivity infusion reactions, human antihuman antibodies (HAHAs), and formation of autoantibodies with rare instances of drug-induced lupus. Several cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma also has been described. Future studies should evaluate optimal timing and duration of anti-TNF therapy, the utility of adjuvant medical treatments during anti-TNF therapy, and evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of the various anti-TNF agents.},

   abstract = {Imbalances in epithelium-matrix interactions have been discussed as a pathomechanism in ulcerative colitis, causing a colonic mucosal barrier dysfunction. Laminin, the major noncollagenous component of the basement membrane, plays a role in epithelial basal lamina formation and promotes differentiation of human enterocytes. We therefore investigated the distribution of laminin in ulcerative colitis affected colonic tissues. Tissue specimens from both affected and nonaffected colonic regions were obtained from ten patients with ulcerative colitis during colonoscopies or operations. Healthy tissue from five patients with colorectal cancer was used as control. After histological classification, the localization and distribution of the basement membrane associated extracellular matrix proteins were determined by immunohistochemistry. Paraffin-embedded sections were incubated with antibodies against laminin and type IV and V collagen. No positive immunoreactivity against laminin was found in most of the epithelial basement membranes surrounding the crypts in affected colonic tissues, without involvement of the subendothelial structures. In contrast, a type IV and V collagen accumulation occurred in all these tissue samples. The lack of laminin in combination with an overexpression of type IV and V collagen, as reported for the first time in this paper, leads to changes in basement membrane structure. These findings indicate that the three-dimensional network of the colonic epithelial basement membrane and its function are seriously disturbed in exacerbating ulcerative colitis. This provides new insights into the importance of cell-matrix interactions for physiological and pathological mechanisms in the etiology of ulcerative colitis.},

There is evidence to suggest that inflammatory bowel diseases may represent an aggressive immunological response to the resident luminal flora, rather than an alteration in the normal flora.

We report the results of recent studies with probiotics in animal models, in which promising effects for the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, pouchitis, and ulcerative colitis were observed.

   abstract = {Most conventional forms of drug therapy suppress or modify the host immunoinflammatory response and neglect the other contributor to disease pathogenesis-the environmental microflora. Probiotics are live microbial food ingredients that alter the enteric microflora and have a beneficial effect on health. The rationale for using probiotics in IBD is mainly based on evidence from human studies and experimental animal models implicating intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of these disorders. The relationship between bacteria and intestinal inflammation is complex and does not appear to reflect a simple cause and effect. Similarly, the field of probiotics is complex and in need of rigorous research. Until the indigenous flora are better characterized and mechanisms of probiotic action defined, the promise of probiotics in IBD is unlikely to be fulfilled. Because of strain-specific variability and clinical and therapeutic heterogeneity within Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, it cannot be assumed that a given probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Although preliminary results of probiotic therapy in animal models and humans with ulcerative colitis and pouchitis have been encouraging, their efficacy in treatment or maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease remains to be clarified. However, the circumstantial evidence for some form of biotherapeutic modification of the enteric flora in Crohn's disease seems compelling. In the future, probiotics may offer a simple adjunct to conventional therapy with the emphasis on diet shifting from one of nutritional replenishment alone to a more functional role.},

METHOD: We review the food intake, presentation, laboratory and radiographic data, and course of two patients who developed ileoanal J-pouch perforation after rapid consumption of meals rich in fiber or calories or both. The potential association between food consumption and rupture is explored. RESULTS: The authors propose that the rapid ingestion of a high-fiber, high-calorie meal may lead to an acute intraluminal pressure elevation or a closed-loop obstruction. These effects may be the basis for an association between food ingestion patterns and perforation at the distal transection site in an ileoanal J-pouch. CONCLUSION: The authors hypothesize that the rapid ingestion of a high-fiber, high-calorie meal may be associated with J-pouch perforation. Further investigative efforts are needed to confirm this association and to evaluate whether a causal relationship is present. If causality is established, physicians may develop a higher index of suspicion for pouch rupture in patients who present with abdominal disturbances after the rapid ingestion of a high-fiber, high-calorie meal.},

   abstract = {Human beings evolved consuming a diet that contained about equal amounts of n-3 and n-6 essential fatty acids. Over the past 100-150 y there has been an enormous increase in the consumption of n-6 fatty acids due to the increased intake of vegetable oils from corn, sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, cottonseed, and soybeans. Today, in Western diets, the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids ranges from approximately 20-30:1 instead of the traditional range of 1-2:1. Studies indicate that a high intake of n-6 fatty acids shifts the physiologic state to one that is prothrombotic and proaggregatory, characterized by increases in blood viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction and decreases in bleeding time. n-3 Fatty acids, however, have antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic, hypolipidemic, and vasodilatory properties. These beneficial effects of n-3 fatty acids have been shown in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and, in some patients with renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most of the studies were carried out with fish oils [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. However, alpha-linolenic acid, found in green leafy vegetables, flaxseed, rapeseed, and walnuts, desaturates and elongates in the human body to EPA and DHA and by itself may have beneficial effects in health and in the control of chronic diseases.},

   abstract = {One of the most topical areas of human nutrition is the role of the gut in health and disease. Specifically, this involves interactions between the resident microbiota and dietary ingredients that support their activities. Currently, it is accepted that the gut microflora contains pathogenic, benign and beneficial components. Some microbially induced disease states such as acute gastroenteritis and pseudomembranous colitis have a defined aetiological agent(s). Speculation on the role of microbiota components in disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, bowel cancer, neonatal necrotising enterocolitis and ulcerative colitis are less well defined, but many studies are convincing. It is evident that the gut microflora composition can be altered through diet. Because of their perceived health-promoting status, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are the commonest targets. Probiotics involve the use of live micro-organisms in food; prebiotics are carbohydrates selectively metabolized by desirable moieties of the indigenous flora; synbiotics combine the two approaches. Dietary intervention of the human gut microbiota is feasible and has been proven as efficacious in volunteer trials. The health bonuses of such approaches offer the potential to manage many gut disorders prophylactically. However, it is imperative that the best methodologies available are applied to this area of nutritional sciences. This will undoubtedly involve a genomic application to the research and is already under way through molecular tracking of microbiota changes to diet in controlled human trials.},

METHODS: Sera from UC (n = 52) and CD (n = 43) patients, and from healthy controls (n = 74) were studied. The indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) method was used for the detection of ANCA and its binding pattern. p-ANCA-positive sera were studied further for putative antigens. ELISAs using lactoferrin (Lf), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and cathepsin G (Cat G) as antigens were performed. RESULTS: ANCA was positive in 40 of the 52 (76.9%) UC (p-ANCA in 33) and in 32 of the 43 (74.4%) CD (p-ANCA in 31) patients. UC and CD patients showed significantly higher titers of p-ANCA than controls; however, no significant difference was observed between UC and CD. In UC, 23, 17, and nine of the 33 patients with p-ANCA-positive sera showed reactivity with Lf, MPO, and Cat-G, respectively. In CD, 21, 20, and 11 of the 31 patients with p-ANCA-positive sera showed reactivity with Lf, MPO, and Cat-G, respectively. Fourteen of the UC and six of the CD patients showed reactivity with two different antigens, and seven of the UC and 11 of the CD patients showed reactivity with all three antigens. The presence of anti-Lf and anti-MPO antibodies was further confirmed by Western blotting. CONCLUSIONS: ANCA is useful in distinguishing patients with IBD from normal subjects but is not sufficient for the differential diagnosis of CD and UC. p-ANCA reactivity might be derived from the recognition of heterogeneous neutrophil-associated antigens.},

Clinical and experimental observations have suggested the potential role of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease therapy. AIM: To evaluate the effects on intestinal microflora and the clinical efficacy of a new probiotic preparation in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with ulcerative colitis, intolerant or allergic to 5-ASA, have been treated with a new probiotic preparation (VSL#3, CSL, Milan, Italy) containing 5x10(11) cells/g of 3 strains of bifidobacteria, 4 strains of lactobacilli and 1 strain of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Two doses of 3 g were administered o.d. for 12 months. Faecal samples for stool culture were obtained from the patients at the beginning of the trial and after 10, 20, 40, 60, 75, 90 days, 12 months and at 15 days after the end of the treatment. The following bacterial groups have been evaluated in the faeces: total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, enterococci, Streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms. Patients were assessed clinically every two months, and assessed endoscopically at 6 and 12 months or in relapse. RESULTS: Faecal concentrations of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increased significantly in all patients, compared to their basal level, from the 20th day of treatment (P<0.05) and remained stable throughout the study. Concentrations of Bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms, total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria did not change significantly during treatment (P = N.S.). Fifteen of 20 treated patients remained in remission during the study, one patient was lost to follow up, while the remaining relapsed. No significant side-effects have been reported. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that this probiotic preparation is able to colonize the intestine, and suggest that it may be useful in maintaining the remission in ulcerative colitis patients intolerant or allergic to 5-ASA. Controlled trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary results.},

   abstract = {Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), especially butyrate, play central metabolic roles in maintaining the mucosal barrier in the gut. A lack of SCFA, leading to endogenous starvation of enterocytes, may be the cause of ulcerative colitis and other inflammatory conditions. The main source of SCFA is dietary fibre, but they can also be derived from structured lipids, e. g. tributyrin. Once absorbed by non-ionic diffusion or carrier-mediated anion exchanges, SCFA are either used locally as fuel for the enterocytes or enter the portal bloodstream. Butyrate has been shown to increase wound healing and to reduce inflammation in the small intestine. In the colon, butyrate is the dominant energy source for epithelial cells and affects cellular proliferation and differentiation by yet unknown mechanisms. Recent data suggest that the luminal provision of butyrate may be an appropriate means to improve wound healing in intestinal surgery and to ameliorate symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate (BBIC) is a soybean extract enriched in the Bowman-Birk inhibitor, a protein protease inhibitor. The Bowman-Birk inhibitor can inhibit proteases released from inflammation mediating cells and suppress superoxide anion radical secretion from immunocytes. This study investigates the ability of Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate to inhibit colon inflammation in the dextran sulfate sodium model of ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease. When compared to mice on a standard diet, mice given food supplemented with 0.5% BBIC during and after dextran sulfate sodium treatment showed suppression of three of four scored histopathological inflammation criteria (P < 0.01), total histopathological score (P < 0.01), a 15% lower mortality rate (P < 0.01), and a delayed onset of mortality. We conclude that dietary Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate can beneficially affect dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice and may be useful in the treatment of human inflammatory bowel diseases, particularly ulcerative colitis.},
