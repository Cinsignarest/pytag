This study analysed life quality and psychological morbidity in 113 patients with an ileostomy using a postal questionnaire which included questions about their opinion of the pouch operation. Of the questionnaires, 73 per cent were suitable for analysis. A total of 93 per cent of those responding were happy with the ileostomy and appeared to have adapted to a normal life with it. Some 87 per cent stated that they would keep the ileostomy in preference to an ileoanal pouch. In addition, psychological morbidity as assessed by the General Health Questionnaire occurred in only 5 per cent of patients.},

A classification for reporting small bowel Crohn's disease is proposed, where the disease is staged as early, advanced or complicated, and the extent of involvement measured directly from the film. The terminal ileum may be normal in 20% of children with proximal Crohn's disease, so that ileoscopy should not be used to exclude small bowel disease. Radiological assessment of the small bowel is important in management. Surgical referral was based on the radiological changes in 6% of patients, and in 24% the presence of extensive uncomplicated small bowel Crohn's disease led to treatment with elemental diet. The use of some specialized examinations, such as the instant and ileostomy enema, are discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies in adults have shown that polymeric (whole protein) diets are as effective as semi-elemental and elemental formulae for the induction of remission in small bowel Crohn's disease. Whole protein diets are more palatable and cheaper. There have been no studies confirming efficacy in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report our experience with seven children with active small bowel Crohn's disease given a casein-based, polymeric feed rich in TGF-beta 2 (Specific Polymeric Diet; Nestle-Clintec; Vevey, Switzerland) as complete nutrition for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Initial and follow-up assessments were performed. All children showed a significant improvement in disease activity, with C-reactive protein returning to normal, an increase in serum albumin and a good weight gain. Initial and follow-up ileal biopsies were assessed and showed reduced mucosal inflammation in six of seven children, with complete healing in two. CONCLUSION: In an uncontrolled descriptive study we have shown that a polymeric (whole protein) diet is a therapeutic option for small bowel Crohn's disease in children. By comprehensive follow-up we have demonstrated clinical and biochemical remission, with an improved endoscopic appearance and a reduction of mucosal inflammation in the terminal ileum.},

   abstract = {Selenium is an essential trace element at lower concentrations and toxic at higher concentration. Animals can metabolize both inorganic and organic forms and convert non methylated Se to mono--or di--or tri--methylated forms, of which, mono-methylated forms are most toxic. Glutathione reductase converts selenoglutathione to H2S in liver and erythrocytes and is ultimately excreted. Se effects the toxicities of xenobiotic agents, provides antagonistic effect to Sulphur and co-administration with Zn increase Se retention in certain organs. At its toxic level (4-8 ppm) it increases Cu contents of heart, liver and kidney and has detoxifying or protecting effect against Cd and Hg. It is a prosthetic group of several seleno metalloenzymes. The concentration of the element is decreased in serum/plasma or erythrocytes of patients of AIDS, trisomy-21, Crohn's and Down's syndrome, phenylketonurea, Keshan's disease and cancer. Rather, the element has antiproliferative and cancer protecting effect. Se content of testes increases considerably during pubertal maturation and, during Se deficiency, the supply to the testes has priority over the other tissues. The element is localized in the mitochondrial capsule protein (MCP) and is involved in biosynthesis of testosterone. Neither the age of mother nor the concentration of Se during pregnancy has any effect on weight of baby or the length of pregnancy. Se levels in human milk is affected by maternal intake and its requirements by infants and young children are higher for their rapid growth. Clinical symptoms of its toxicity include severe irritations of respiratory system, metallic taste in mouth, formication of nose, signs of rhinitis, lung edema and brancho-pneumonia. The typical garlic odour of breath and sweat is due to dimethyl-selenide.},

The treatment has to be undertaken with a daily intake equivalent to 1 mg/kg per day of prednisolone for a 3 to 7 week period. Immunosuppressive agents are indicated in case of corticodependency or in case of large intestinal resection. Artificial nutrition (enteral or parenteral) is proposed in corticoresistant forms, and is usually followed by an immunosuppressive therapy. Surgical management is reserved for complications, including resistance to all medical therapy. Surgical resection has to be limited in order to avoid a short bowel syndrome. Surgery should not be considered as the ideal therapy as it has been demonstrated that recurrence after surgery increases at distance. 5-aminosalycilates compounds are an alternative therapy in mild attacks. Mesalazine may reduce the recurrence and could be considered as a possible maintenance treatment.},

We carried out a study of patient tolerance in a group of Crohn's disease (CD) patients with a new fish oil derivative consisting of 500-mg capsules of eicosapentaenoic-docosahexaenoic (EPA 40%-DHA 20%), a free fatty acid mixture (Purepa), and we also evaluated its incorporation into phospholipids, both in plasma and in red cell membranes. Five groups of 10 CD patients in remission received nine Purepa capsules daily in four different preparations (A: uncoated, B: coated, pH 5.5; C: coated, pH 5.5, 60 min time release; D: coated, pH 6.9) and 12 x 1-g capsules daily of a triglyceride preparation (Max-EPA, EPA 18%-DHA 10%), respectively. We coated three of the four Purepa preparations in order to delay the release of contents in an attempt to minimize the side effects. After six weeks of treatment, the group taking Purepa capsules, coated, pH 5.5, 60 min time release (group C) showed the best incorporation of EPA and DHA in red blood cell phospholipid membranes (EPA from 0.2 to 4.4%, DHA from 3.7 to 6.3%), and no side effects were registered, whereas in all other groups side effects were experienced in 50% or more of subjects. This new preparation will make it possible to treat patients for long periods.},

The knowledge about the interference between disease and pregnancy influences the management of pregnancy and delivery as well as of the disease itself. Intensive care, including genetic counseling, dietary management, and drug therapy ought to start even before pregnancy. In the care of the pregnant patient with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis corticosteroids and sulphasalazine may be used just as in the nonpregnant patient. An increased activity of the disease in the beginning of pregnancy causes high rates of prematurity, spontaneous abortions, and stillbirths. Frequency of defects in embryonic development varies between 0 and 4% and is even higher in severe cases of Crohn's disease. Prophylactic drug administration in pregnancy is not suitable to decrease the risk of exacerbation. Several studies revealed that the risk of exacerbation is not increased during pregnancy. Low activity in the onset of pregnancy is continued in 61%. Higher rates of abdominal and vaginal operative deliveries (26% in Crohn's disease) seems to be associated with active intervention on the base of activity indices.},

In the abnormal group, the most frequent diseases we diagnose were: polyps, cancer, diverticular disease, and specific inflammatory disease of the bowel like TBC, radiation proctosigmoiditis, amebiasis, and non-specific bowel disease: "colitis", ulcerative proctocolitis, erosive colitis, and Crohn's disease. Colonoscopy is a very important method for diagnosis of colon diseases, alone or complementary of double contrast X-ray of the colon.},

   abstract = {Circumstantial evidence indicates that immunological mechanisms are important in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. In Crohn's disease lesions the naive T cells are reduced and memory T cells are increased in number. Colonocytes of normal mucosa do not express MHC class II molecules but aberrant HLA-DR expression is induced in inflammatory conditions. Also in ileal epithelial cells there is increased MHC class II molecules expression suggesting augmented antigen presentation. Once the initiating event (environmental, dietary, infectious or enterobacterial products) has activated inflammatory cells, an auto-amplifying inflammatory immune cascade is induced by numerous agents such as cytokines, transforming growth factors, leukotrienes, prostaglandins and other mediators. Tissue injury may be caused by oxygen free radicals generated by neutrophils and macrophages. The inflammatory process can be perpetuated by a persistent antigenic stimulus or alternatively, by abnormal regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. This can mean exaggerated activation of inflammatory responses to "normal" stimuli or defective feedback mechanisms of down-regulation. The early lesions of inflammatory bowel disease are patchy necrosis of the surface epithelium, focal accumulations of leukocytes adjacent to crypts and an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes. In Crohn's disease the earliest lesions are aphthoid ulcers overlying lymphoid follicles in the terminal ileum. In patients with spondylarthropathy and asymptomatic intestinal inflammation we demonstrated lesions in the top of the follicle associated epithelium. The changes consist of increase in number of membranous (M) epithelial cells, ruptures, fissures and perforations of M cells. Aphthoid ulcers that may occur in the entire gastrointestinal tract are typically found at the M cell level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Following exposure to a crude saline extract (Sacc), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from these subjects demonstrated dose-dependent increases in tritiated thymidine incorporation, the time-course of which resembled that of the response to the known recall antigens PPD and TT. This was accompanied by increased cytotoxicity of the cultured cells for natural killer (NK)-sensitive and NK-resistant target cell lines. Furthermore, using a purified, high molecular weight, glycoprotein fraction of Sacc in culture, a dose-dependent lymphoproliferative response was again observed. Stimulation indices (SI) for thymidine incorporation by umbilical cord blood lymphocytes exposed to Sacc were low compared with those of normal adults. These results provide evidence for possible antigen-specific, cellular, immune sensitization of normal individuals to a ubiquitous dietary component.},

A system of structured analysis is suggested, with separate consideration of destructive ulceration, inflammatory activity and other factors. Direct investigation of gut immunity by using whole gut lavage fluid (WGLF) is a valuable new technique of clinical investigation in IBD and related disorders. Recent studies have shown that the concentrations of plasma-derived proteins in WGLF provide objective measures of disease activity; and that this activity is a separate phenomenon from destructive ulceration and fibrosis. Neutrophils in the lumen can be in- investigated by cytology, or by assay of neutrophil elastase in WGLF. Cytokines and other immuno-regulatory mediators can also be detected. These new techniques can provide a description of intestinal immunity and inflammation, based on a non-invasive test of 2-4 h duration. Work in progress shows that patients who respond clinically to elemental diet treatment have unusually high concentrations of soluble IL2 receptor in WGLF; cytokine profiles may facilitate the selection of patients suitable for other new treatment modalities.},

   abstract = {The developments in enteral feeding for Crohn's disease in the past decade are critically reviewed. The advent of amino acid based chemically defined elemental diets signalled the end of 'total bowel rest' in the management of these patients. Subsequently, controlled clinical trials showed that elemental diets were as effective as corticosteroids in inducing clinical remission in patients with acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease. The later use of peptide based elemental diets, in Crohn's disease produced somewhat conflicting results. The initial uncontrolled studies suggest that polymeric whole protein diets might also be effective in the management of acute exacerbations of the disease, casting in turn doubts concerning the role of dietary antigens in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Results of controlled studies comparing the use of elemental and polymeric diets as primary therapy in Crohn's disease have, however, also produced conflicting results. The results of one recent controlled trial in which the use of polymeric diet was compared with that of corticosteroids does, however, suggest that these diets may have a primary therapeutic effect in Crohn's disease. An analysis of the composition of some of the enteral diets used in different trials suggest that the effectiveness of enteral diets in treating active Crohn's disease might relate more to their fat than nitrogen composition. A hypothesis is proposed that the effectiveness of enteral nutrition in the primary therapy of acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease occurs because the successful diets used contain insufficient precursors for arachidonate derived eicosanoid synthesis.},

The polymeric diet was administered through a fine bore nasogastric tube by continuous, pump assisted infusion (2800 (SEM 120) kcal/day). The steroid group received 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone. Both treatments were effective in inducing clinical remission: 15 of the 17 patients given steroids and 12 of the 15 patients assigned to the polymeric diet went into clinical remission (defined by a Van Hees index < 120) within four weeks of treatment. The percentage reduction of the Van Hees index was 34.8 (4.9)% for steroids and 32.3 (5)% for enteral nutrition (mean difference 2.5%; 95% CI--11.8% to +16.8%). Mean time elapsed to achieve remission was similar in both groups (2.0 (1) v 2.4 (1.2) weeks). Tolerance of the enteral diet was excellent. Four patients in the steroid group had mild complications attributable to this treatment. Ten patients (66.6%) in the steroid group and five (41.6%) in the enteral nutrition group relapsed within a year of discharge, but no differences were found in the cumulative probability of relapse during the follow up period. These results suggest that polymeric enteral nutrition is as safe and effective as steroids in inducing short term remission in active Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Elemental diet is as effective as corticosteroids in the treatment of previously untreated Crohn's disease. It is unclear whether a poor nutritional state is a prerequisite for efficacy of elemental diet, whether previously treated patients respond as well, or how duration of remission using elemental diet compares with corticosteroid induced remission. Forty two patients with active Crohn's disease were stratified for nutritional state and randomised to receive Vivonex TEN 2.1 l/day for four weeks, or 0.75 mg prednisolone/kg/day for two weeks and subsequent reducing doses. Nine of 22 (41%) patients assigned to nutritional treatment were intolerant of the diet. Thirty patients completed four weeks treatment. Disease activity decreased on elemental diet from mean (SEM) 4.8 (0.9) to 1.7 (0.6), p < 0.05, and on prednisolone from 5.3 (0.5) to 1.9 (0.6), p < 0.05. For each treatment, nourished and malnourished patients responded similarly. Patients with longstanding disease responded as well as newly diagnosed patients. The probability of maintaining remission at six months was 0.67 after prednisolone, 0.28 after elemental diet, and at one year was 0.35 after prednisolone and 0.09 after elemental diet, p < 0.05. When tolerated, elemental diet is as effective in the short term as prednisolone in newly and previously diagnosed Crohn's disease, and its benefit is independent of nutritional state. The subsequent relapse rate after elemental diet induced remission, however, is greater than after treatment with prednisolone.},

   abstract = {Growth impairment is a common complication of childhood Crohn's disease, but longitudinal data and follow up studies into adulthood are sparse. This study reviewed the records of 100 Tanner stages 1 and 2 children (66 males, 34 females) consecutively diagnosed with Crohn's disease at this hospital between January 1980 and June 1988. The influence of sex, anatomical location of disease, severity of symptoms, corticosteroids, and surgical intervention on growth were analysed by univariate and multivariate regression analysis. At diagnosis mean standard deviation score (SDS) for height was -1.11 (1.28) (males -1.14 (1.26), females -1.05 (1.33)). Twenty one children were below the third centile for height. During years one and two height velocity (cm/y) was 4.4 (2.3) and 5.1 (2.7), but 40% of children in year one and 33% of children in year two grew less than expected (< 4 cm). Forty nine children grew < 4 cm/y during two or more of the 4.9 (1.8) years of follow up. Severity of gastrointestinal symptoms was the major factor influencing linear growth velocity (p < 0.01 for years one and two). Despite the high prevalence of growth impairment, the subset of children who had reached maturity by the time of the study (n = 67) nevertheless maintained their height centile. The SDS for height at ultimate follow up was -0.82 (1.1). Compared with diagnosis, change in SDS was +0.35 (1.08). Growth increments were comparable for surgically treated patients v patients only treated medically and among patients stratified by location of disease. Females (n = 25) achieved greater catch up growth than males (n = 42). Ultimate SDS for height for females was -0.48 (0.91) v -1.02 (1.19) for males. Change in SDS for height was +0.66 (1.27) for females v +0.16 (0.90) for males (p=0.02). These data confirm the frequency of growth impairment in childhood Crohn's disease. After diagnosis, however, the prognosis for ultimate linear growth is good.},

The compound was administered in the diet for 119 weeks (rats) and 120 weeks (mice) at dose levels of 100, 300 and 900/1800 mg/kg b.w./d for mice and of 300, 900 and 2700/1800 mg/kg b.w./d for rats. The administration of benzalazine produced no effects on survival, appearance or behaviour. Body weights of the high-dosed male mice and rats (both sexes) were occasionally significantly decreased when compared to the controls. A slight but in most cases statistically significant reduction of the relative food consumption of the female mice of all treated groups was observed between test weeks 6 and 12. In the high-dosed rats a statistically significant increase of the relative food consumption was found between test weeks 17 and 109. At necropsy, there was no evidence of treatment-related changes, nor were these seen on histopathological examination. All microscopic changes seen in mice and rats were of the usual type commonly occurring in untreated aged NMRI mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. However, an increased incidence of thyroid cystic hyperplasia was found in the rats of the high dose-level group. In addition, an increased incidence of thyroid adenomas was found in the male rats of the high-dosed group only as compared to the control groups. This increased tumour incidence is regarded as a marginal finding and may be of a spontaneous nature within the normal range of the background data. However, a substance-related influence cannot completely be excluded. In conclusion, the administration of benzalazine for more than 24 months to NMRI mice and Sprague-Dawley rats produced only slight effects on body weight in the high-dosed male mice and in rats (both sexes) with a no-effect level of 300 mg/kg b.w./d in the diet for mice or 900 mg/kg b.w./d in the diet for rats. There was no evidence of an oncogenic effect of benzalazine.},

We examined the effects of an elemental diet (ED) in Crohn's disease with special reference to the maintenance of remission. Eighty-four patients received total enteral nutrition with the ED (35 to 40 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day) and/or conventional drug treatment for induction of remission. Sixty-one patients in remission were then followed-up with prolonged ED therapy (home elemental enteral hyperalimentation, HEEH) and/or drugs. During the follow-up periods the course of patients receiving HEEH was better than those of patients without HEEH, namely the cumulative continuous remission rates after one, 2 and 4 years were, 94%, 63% and 63% in the group receiving HEEH, 75%, 66% and 66% in the group receiving HEEH and drugs, 63%, 42% and 0% in the group receiving drugs, and 50%, 33% and 0% in the group receiving no maintenance therapy, respectively. In particular, when more than 30 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day of the ED was given, the maintenance of remission was successful in 95% of the patients. These results indicated that ED therapy was effective not only for the induction of remission but also for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1984 and 1992, nine patients (seven men and two women, aged 16-34 years; mean, 20 years) with Crohn disease, who had evidence of only aphthous erosions or ulcers at the initial examination, underwent repeated radiography for up to 7 years 11 months (median, 4 years). RESULTS: In all patients, the stomach, duodenum, small intestine, and colorectum were involved, and the esophagus was affected in three patients. Subsequently, four of the nine patients had lesions that progressed from aphthous lesions to overt Crohn disease, including ileitis in two patients, colitis in one, and ileocolitis in one. Time intervals between the first visit and the progression varied from 9 months to 3 years 6 months. In all eight patients who underwent nutritional treatment, regression of the lesions was recognized, but three of the lesions progressed during interruption of the nutritional diet. CONCLUSION: Crohn disease may initially appear as diffuse aphthous lesions in the gastrointestinal mucosa.},

Twenty-one (21%) had DL-lactate concentrations (range, 8-95 mmol/l) above the 95% limit (6.1 mmol/l) in healthy individuals. Inflammatory bowel disease with active proctitis was associated with increased faecal DL-lactate in 11 of 15 patients (73%) (mean, 32 mmol/l; range, 8-95 mmol/l) and in the 1 patient with pouchitis (8 mmol/l), whereas only 1 of 8 patients (13%) with active inflammatory bowel disease without proctitis had L-lactate elevation (25 mmol/l). Among 26 patients with malabsorption and quiescent or noninflammatory bowel disease, 3 of 17 (18%) with preserved colonic function and 3 of 9 (33%) with jejunostomy had increased faecal lactate. Only 2 of 50 (4%) patients with neither active inflammatory bowel disease nor malabsorption had faecal DL-lactate elevation. In vitro bacterial fermentation of most dietary polysaccharides did not cause accumulation of lactate, corresponding to a lack of correlation between faecal carbohydrate excretion and lactate accumulation. An isolated increase in faecal L-lactate was observed in 6 of 13 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, whereas D-lactate was not increased without a simultaneous increase of the L-lactate isomer. In conclusion, the faecal lactate concentration was frequently increased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and proctitis, occasionally increased in patients with severe malabsorption, and often normal in patients with quiescent inflammatory bowel disease or localized Crohn's ileitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {To investigate the relationship between serum concentrations of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease, serum IL-8 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 93 patients. Interleukin-8 levels were compared with plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in 80 of these patients. Interleukin-8 levels were also measured in ten patients with active Crohn's disease, before and after treatment with a defined formula polymeric diet. Of these patients, 70 out of 93 IL-8 concentrations were below the detection limit of the assay. Levels were higher in patients with active ulcerative colitis (median < 20 pg/mL, 75th centile value = 190) compared with inactive disease (median and 75th centile value < 20; P < 0.05). Interleukin-8 concentrations correlated with a combined score for disease severity and extent (P = 0.01). Thirty-eight per cent (8/20) of patients with active Crohn's disease also had high levels of IL-8 but there was no significant difference between active and inactive disease. There was no correlation between serum IL-8 and plasma IL-6; on the contrary, very few patients had raised blood levels of both cytokines. In the diet treated group, serum IL-8 fell significantly after treatment (median = 37 pg/mL, range < 20-4615 before treatment, median < 20, range < 20-104 after treatment; P = 0.03). The results suggest that although IL-8 may be involved in the inflammatory process in inflammatory bowel disease, it is a poor marker of disease activity.},

The patients consisted of 60 with quiescent Crohn's disease who were given LRD (Clinimeal or Ensure Liquid) for maintenance therapy for more than one year (average 2.4 years) after discharge from our institute. On the basis of the quantity of LRD given per day, the patients were classified into three groups: A; O to 799 kcal a day, B; 800 to 1599 kcal a day and C; more than 1600 kcal a day. The remission rate and the avoidance rate of admission were calculated and compared among three groups. The remission rate in group C was significantly higher than those in groups A and B. The avoidance rates of admission in groups B and C were significantly higher than that in group A. These results suggest that drinking of LRD at home is useful for the maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease and that the effect of LRD depends on the quantity of LRD given per day.},

   abstract = {The mechanisms of nutritional therapy in inflammatory bowel disease have not been thoroughly established. It is likely that a further understanding of the underlying disease process will allow better understanding of these forms of therapy, with a sounder rationale for the construction of specific diet constituents for therapy. Regardless, nutritional therapy is likely to be multidimensional, and various forms may affect different aspects of the disease process. Decreased inflammatory factors, decreased antigenic stimuli, provision of essential nutrients, improved immune function, and other factors may all be of varying importance in different patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Little work has been done on the role of diet therapy in the long-term treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease as a method of preventing relapse. Parenteral nutrition and elemental diets appear to have limited roles in this area. Some investigation has been done to see if minor modifications of the normal diet can prolong remission periods. Low-fiber diets are frequently recommended for patients with strictures. Whether this has any significant effect on symptoms, inflammation, or complications is unclear. Heaton et al suggested that a high-fiber, unrefined carbohydrate diet resulted in fewer and shorter hospitalizations. In a prospective follow-up study by Ritchie et al, however, these results were not able to be reproduced. Exclusion diets have also been suggested as a means of reducing relapse rates in patients with Crohn's disease. In a small, randomized, controlled trial of an exclusion diet versus an unrefined carbohydrate, fiber-rich diet, there were significantly fewer relapses among the patients treated with the exclusion diet at 6 months. These diets require intensive patient cooperation, but the potential side effects are minimal. Clearly, these findings need to be reproduced in large, prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread use can be advocated. A great deal of data exists on the use of nutritional supplementation in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, although little of it is in the form of large, randomized, controlled studies. Nutritional manipulation currently has a limited role in patients with ulcerative colitis; a much broader role exists in patients with Crohn's disease. The mechanisms by which nutritional therapy affects these diseases may include a combination of factors--decreased antigenic exposure, improved immune function, and provision of essential nutrients and calories needed for bowel regeneration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Malnutrition is frequently seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and parenteral or enteral nutrition is considered essential in this patient group. However, many patients with Crohn's disease have difficulties in gaining weight in response to overfeeding, suggesting reduced energy retention. Substrate utilization and nutrient balances as well as changes in body composition were followed in 10 patients with Crohn's disease immediately in the course of remission on low-dose steroid treatment, during an eight-day period of continuous enteral nutrition at constant (protocol 1:1.5-fold basal energy expenditure) and increasing (protocol 2:0.5- to 2.0-fold basal energy expenditure) nutrient supply. Energy, substrate, and nitrogen balances all became positive in response to overfeeding. However, fat was predominantly oxidized at an infusion rate of 1.2 g/kg body wt/day, whereas carbohydrates and proteins were effectively stored. A positive energy balance was reached at an energy infusion rate exceeding 31 kcal/kg body wt/day and corresponding substrate supplies of 1.6, 1.7, and 1.1 g/kg body wt/day for carbohydrates, fat, and protein, respectively. Nitrogen balance normalized at a supply of 0.14 g/kg body wt/day, which also reduced myofibrillar protein breakdown. Considering the relative contributions made by these nutrients in the diets, an accumulation of carbohydrates and protein but a depletion in fat became evident from nutrient balances. In fact, body weight increased by 0.12 kg/day, which was explained by an increased extracellular (+0.18 kg/day) and body cell mass (+0.04 kg/day) at reduced fat mass (-0.10 kg/day). Concomitantly, plasma T3 and insulin secretion both increased, whereas sympathetic nervous system activity decreased with overfeeding. This is contrary to data observed in healthy subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

An animal experiment in pigs has been conducted. After creation of an anisoperistaltic segment these were fed either a specific fat diet containing chemically processed, partially hydrogenated fats or a low fat control diet over a period of 3 months. Defined areas of the ileal lamina propria were examined by transmission electron microscopy with the underlying question to what extent ultrastructural alterations could be compared to Crohn's disease. In comparison to the control group these areas were characterized by a dense infiltration of "inflammatory" cells like lymphocytes, histiocytes, macrophages and plasma cells indicating a hyperplasia and activation of lympho-plasmocytotic cells. Additionally, a focal prominent infiltration of mast cells with degranulation was observed as well as a dilatation of axons with depletion of axonal organelles in half of the animals after fat-feeding. Compared to patients with Crohn's disease the results show obvious similarities. It is concluded, that chemically processed fats could cause direct stimulation of immunologically-specific and non-specific cells in the lamina propria mucosae or directly injure the intestinal mucosa with secondary infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lamina propria.},

   abstract = {It has been claimed that prolonged remissions of Crohn's disease can be achieved after enteral or parenteral nutrition, by identifying and excluding foods that exacerbate a patient's symptoms. The occurrence of food intolerances were assessed after induction of remission with elemental diet in 42 eligible patients to whom single foods were introduced over five days. Suspect foods were reinvestigated with open and if possible, double blind rechallenge. Fourteen patients (33%) dropped out of the study because of relapse of disease unrelated to food (n = 8) or because of difficulties in complying with the regimen (n = 6). Twenty (48%) of the patients identified food sensitivities whereas eight (19%) did not. Seventeen of the patients who identified food sensitivities had an open rechallenge with recurrence of symptoms in 10 (24% of total). Food sensitivity was confirmed in three patients on double blind challenge. There was no significant difference in the duration of remission between patients who did or did not identify food sensitivities. During the study three cases of intolerance to the formula diet, and one of severe salicylate sensitivity were encountered. In conclusion food sensitivities are evident after treatment of Crohn's disease with elemental diet but are variable, often do not persist, and are of insufficient importance to warrant putting all patients through elimination diets.},

   abstract = {We examined the patterns of trefoil peptide gene expression in the ulcer-associated cell lineage (UACL) and mucosa adjacent to Crohn's disease in humans and during gastrointestinal adaptation to enteral feeding in rats. In the UACL, human spasmolytic polypeptide (hSP) mRNA and peptide are present in the acinar and proximal duct cells, whereas pS2 mRNA and peptide are found in the distal duct cells and in the surface cells. In mucosa adjacent to UACL, pS2 mRNA and peptide are expressed ectopically by goblet cells and neuroendocrine cells. Intestinal crypts associated with the UACL showed marked neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia. Ultrastructural immunolocalization showed pS2 to be copackaged in the mucous cell and neuroendocrine granules. The copackaging of a secretory protein in both mucous and neuroendocrine granules, which have different functions, is unusual and indicates an important role for pS2 in the secretory process itself or as a ligand delivered to its receptor via multiple routes. We also cloned the newest trefoil peptide, intestinal trefoil factor (ITF), from human and rat intestinal mucosa. Using in situ hybridization we demonstrated its synthesis by normal rat intestinal goblet cells. RNAse protection analysis revealed that the level of mRNA for rat ITF in small and large intestine was affected by the process of enteral feeding. We conclude that trefoil peptides are widely distributed in the intestine in human inflammatory bowel disease and are of considerable potential functional importance.},

   abstract = {Given its anatomical location the small intestine is the section of the digestive tract most inaccessible to objective clinical and instrumental examination. For this reason, traditional investigation methods provide inadequate data. In the barium meal X-ray, images are superimposed and the barium excessively fragmented due to the tortuosity and length of the intestinal loop. Access problems limit the value of endoscopy. The indications to angiography are fairly restrictive. Ultrasound and CT scans provide no conclusive evidence in this area. The so-called Small Bowel Enema technique based on the direct infusion of an opaque contrast medium after duodenal intubation remains the only way to obtain images with a satisfactory diagnostic value and should be the method of choice in examinations of the small intestine. Introduced in the twenties, the value of the technique was long questioned, mainly because it was difficult to perform correctly and it is only quite recently that several decisive technological innovations have made it highly reliable. The present paper describes its use on a series of patients with suspected pathologies of the small intestine requiring surgical treatment. The aim is to specify the correct indications to this technique as well as its limitations with a view to promoting its appropriate use in routine practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The study covers 42 small bowel enemas performed on 29 male and 13 female patients aged 12-85 years. Indications to the enema included chronic abdominal pain in 28.5%, chronic diarrhea in 21.4%, pain+diarrhea in 14%, subocclusion in 16.5%, faecal blood in 11.9%, abdominal pain+diarrhea+intestinal haemorrhage in 4.7%, anaemia in 2.4%. We adopted the Sellink technique involving intubation with a French 14 Bilbao-Dotter probe and the infusion of 200-350 cc barium sulphate in a 90%-70% P/V concentration at a speed of 100 ml/min, followed by the infusion of 1000-1500 cc 0.5-1% methylcellulose in a 50-50 mixture with water for double contrast purposes. Mean duration of procedure 35-40 mins. RESULTS. We found lesions of the small intestine in 18 cases or 45% (true positives) and no alterations in 18 or 42.8% (true negatives). In 3 cases (7%) the examination was inconclusive. One false positive and one false negative complete the series, making a diagnostic accuracy of 89.1%. In 23.8% of the total series the diagnosis of Crohn's disease was confirmed; cancerous lesions were found in 11.9% and adhesions following earlier surgery in 9.7%. Surgery confirmed this diagnosis in 10 cases (5 tumours, 3 stenoses caused by adhesion fragments, 2 Crohn's disease) and disproved it in one case. Biopsy was used, for objective confirmation in 5 cases (2 Crohn's disease, 3 negatives). In the other cases reliance was placed on clinical course and the patients' response to treatment. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS. Examination of our results reveals that in most clinical cases the small bowel enema was used to confirm suspected Crohn's disease (31 cases out of 42) and with a very high degree of diagnostic accuracy (96.7%). In line with data in the literature we decided to base the indication to this examination on certain primary symptoms such as chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in the faeces, whether in isolation or in combination. On this rather general basis the diagnosis of Crohn's disease concerned only 23.8% of the cases studied, an incidence that rose dramatically in the few cases in which the indications were made more specific. We therefore conclude that the adoption of more restrictive criteria will improve the cost-benefit ratio for this test. Another major pathology in which small bowel enema possesses a high diagnostic value is partial obstruction of the small intestine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Because weight loss is common in colonic Crohn's disease and is poorly correlated with disease activity, we analyzed food intake in 63 patients without malabsorption, 30 patients with weight loss (9.2 +/- 4.2 kg), and 33 patients without weight loss. Energy and protein intakes were lower in patients with weight loss than in those with stable weight (P < 0.01). In the former group, food restrictions were more numerous (P < 0.01) and visual analog scales showed less hunger, decreased appetite, and fewer sensations of pleasure related to eating, as compared with the other group (P < 0.01). Food intake reduction was also related to depressive mood and medical advice. However, there was no difference between groups in fecal energy wasting and resting energy expenditure. Weight loss in Crohn's disease may be due to a decrease in food intake rather than to an increase in energy cost of the disease. Thus, focus of attention on the diet is crucial to prevent malnutrition.},

   abstract = {Elemental diet is as effective in producing remission of Crohn's disease (CD) as is corticosteroid treatment, but most patients relapse soon after resumption of a normal diet. We have investigated the efficacies of dietary modification and oral corticosteroids in maintaining remission achieved with elemental diet. In a multicentre trial, 136 patients with active CD were started on elemental diet and other treatment was withdrawn. 43 (31%) declined to continue elemental diet for 14 days, but 78 (84%) of the remaining 93 achieved remission and were randomly assigned corticosteroids (38) or diet (40). Corticosteroid treatment started at 40 mg prednisolone daily, which was tapered and stopped after 12 weeks; that group received dietary advice on healthy eating. The diet group received "tapered" placebo and were instructed to introduce one new food daily, excluding any that precipitated symptoms. Assessment of progress for up to 2 years was made by physicians unaware of group assignment. Intention-to-treat analysis showed median lengths of remission of 3.8 (interquartile range 5.0) months in the corticosteroid group and 7.5 (15.3) months on diet, and relapse rates at 2 years, adjusted for withdrawals, of 79% and 62%, respectively (p = 0.048). Clinical improvement in the diet group was associated with significant changes in plasma albumin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin concentrations and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Food intolerances discovered were predominantly to cereals, dairy products, and yeast. Diet provides a further therapeutic strategy in active Crohn's disease.},

A newly proposed hypothesis for CD suggests that enteral lipids together with certain luminal bacterial fragments become strongly antigenic to produce an inflammatory reaction analogous to the adjuvant response.

   abstract = {Elemental diets are considered an effective primary treatment for active Crohn's disease. This study examined the hypothesis that improvement occurs because of the presence of amino acids or the low fat content, or both. A randomised, controlled trial was undertaken in 40 patients with active Crohn's disease to evaluate clinical and nutritional outcomes after an amino acid based diet containing 3% fat was given by a feeding tube compared with a peptide based diet containing 33% fat. After three weeks' treatment, clinical remission occurred in 84% of patients who were given the amino acid diet and 75% of patients who received the peptide diet (p = 0.38). Plasma linoleic acid concentration was reduced after the amino acid but not the peptide diet. An increase in total body nitrogen was associated with the magnitude of nutritional depletion before treatment and at six months' follow up, only patients who showed gains in total body nitrogen after enteral nutrition had a sustained clinical remission. This study shows that peptide based high fat diets are as effective as amino acid low fat diets for achieving clinical remission in active Crohn's disease. Improved total body protein stores but not essential fatty acid depletion may be an important indicator of a sustained remission.},

   abstract = {Nineteen children with either newly diagnosed or relapsed Crohn's disease were enrolled in a randomized study in which the efficacy of enteral feeding with a whole protein-based formula was compared to high-dose corticosteroids in achieving clinical remission and normalization of laboratory measurements. Ten children were treated by enteral feeding (Nutrison Standard, Nutricia), and nine received corticosteroids. Both treatment regimens lasted 11 weeks. The activity of Crohn's disease was similar in both groups before the commencement of the treatment. Clinical symptoms and signs, as judged by the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index and measurements relating to inflammatory activity (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, blood leukocyte and platelet count, and serum immunoglobulins G and A) and to nutritional status (concentrations of serum albumin, prealbumin, hemoglobin) improved rapidly and significantly with as little as 2 weeks' treatment in both treatment groups. In both groups, there was one relapse within 8 weeks after discontinuation of treatment, and one patient in both groups was operated on during the treatment period. During the routine follow-up after the trial (0.3-2.5 years; mean, 1.3 years) five of the corticosteroid group experienced a clinical relapse, whereas only one from the enteral feeding group relapsed. No side effects of enteral feeding were seen. Enteral feeding with a whole protein-based formula proved to be as effective as high-dose corticosteroid in the treatment of the acute phase of Crohn's disease and may prove to be the treatment of choice in pediatric patients with acute Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: The TF antigen (galactose-beta 1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine alpha) is overexpressed in malignant and premalignant colonic epithelium. Previous studies have shown that peanut lectin (PNA), which binds TF, is mitogenic for normal human colonic epithelium. This study aimed to determine its effect on abnormal colonic epithelium. METHODS: Crypt cell proliferation rate (CCPR) was measured using vincristine arrest and mucus synthesis by incorporation of radiolabeled N-acetyl glucosamine in colonoscopic biopsy specimens cultured with and without PNA. RESULTS: Unstimulated CCPR was greater in patients with ulcerative colitis than in patients with histologically normal colon. PNA (25 micrograms/mL) produced a 25% average increase in CCPR in tissues from patients with ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and colonic polyps. In ulcerative colitic biopsy specimens incubated with PNA, CCPR increased to more than double that of unstimulated normal colonic epithelium. In controls, the response to PNA was greater when adjacent specimens were positive for PNA (avidin-biotin) histochemistry than when they were negative. Mucus synthesis was increased by an average 75% over 24 hours by PNA. CONCLUSIONS: Increased TF expression by premalignant epithelia may allow stimulation of proliferation by dietary galactose N-acetylgalactosamine-binding lectins. If the hyperplasia-dysplasia cancer hypothesis is correct, this could explain the increased colon cancer risk in ulcerative colitis.},

Orally administered corticosteroids, sulfasalazine, metronidazole, azathioprine, and cyclosporine have not proved of benefit in the prevention of recurrences of Crohn's disease. Nonetheless, corticosteroids, metronidazole, and azathioprine can control chronically active disease. Methotrexate may have some benefit in the treatment of active Crohn's disease, but its role in maintenance of remission has not been investigated. Elimination diets seem to prolong periods of symptomatic remission. Further studies are needed to define subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit from preventive therapy.},

Abnormal folate absorption was not correlated with disease extent or activity. In patients with only impaired folate absorption, it might be sufficient to increase dietary intake of folates.

   abstract = {A combined body scan technique for measuring total energy expenditure (TEE) from energy intake and changes in energy stores is presented. The TEE of 13 patients with Crohn's disease who required nutrition support over a 14-day period was measured. They had a mean TEE of 33 kcal/kg per day. The components of the TEE in these 13 patients were also measured. Seventy percent of the TEE was made up by resting metabolic expenditure, 10% by diet-induced thermogenesis, and the remaining 20% by activity energy expenditure. These patients had a mean activity energy expenditure of 369 kcal/day. The diet-induced thermogenesis was a mean 12.6% increase on the resting metabolic expenditure. Each percent increase was caused by a mean of 210 kcal of energy in either the intravenous nutrition or the enteral nutrition. There was no difference in diet-induced thermogenesis between those having enteral nutrition and those receiving intravenous nutrition. Decreased activity was significantly correlated with increased activity of the disease (r = .7, p < .01). This confirms the belief that patients with Crohn's disease require no more energy (ie, 33 kcal/kg per day) than other patients. If the resting metabolic expenditure is increased through illness, then the activity energy expenditure decreases. The combined in vivo neutron activation-dual energy x-ray absorptiometry technique has allowed for the first time measurements in ward patients with Crohn's disease. The measurements confirm that TEE is not raised and that 30 to 35 kcal/kg per day is sufficient to achieve energy balance in such patients.},

We therefore examined the effects of continuous enteral nutrition on gallbladder motility and cholecystokinin (CCK) release in six patients. METHODS: Gallbladder volume was measured ultrasonographically for 12 h on days 1 (start), 8, 22 (6-h interruption of enteral feeding), 36, and 43 (end) of enteral feeding. Plasma CCK was assessed at several time points. RESULTS: Initial fasting gallbladder volume was 19.3 +/- 4.5 (mean +/- SEM) ml, which decreased to 4.9 +/- 3.6 ml after start of feeding. CCK increased from 1.5 +/- 0.3 to 3.9 +/- 1.1 pmol/l. On days 8 and 36 the gallbladder was almost completely contracted, and CCK increased to 7.5 +/- 2.7 and 8.3 +/- 2.6 pmol/l, respectively. On days 22 and 43 gallbladder volume increased, and CCK decreased rapidly to fasting concentrations after interruption of feeding. CONCLUSIONS: During continuous enteral nutrition the gallbladder is completely contracted, and CCK concentrations remain elevated. It is therefore unlikely that long-term enteral nutrition contributes to the increased prevalence of gallstones in patients with Crohn's disease.},

Histological evidence of inflammation was common in the stomach and jejunum. Moreover, eight of 10 patients undergoing colonoscopy had low grade 'microscopic colitis' with raised intraepithelial lymphocytes and an intact crypt architecture. Five of 12 patients had small intestinal inflammation on 111indium leucocyte scintigrams and all had increased faecal excretion (normal < 1%) of 111indium (over four days), which varied in intensity from mild (faecal excretion of 111indium = 1-3%) to that comparable with moderately active (7-14.5%) Crohn's disease. Three patients had small intestinal strictures superficially resembling Crohn's disease. Histologically, however, these lacked characteristic diagnostic features of Crohn's disease in two and the third patient had non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced diaphragm like strictures. Six of seven who were most severely symptomatic were successfully treated with an elemental diet with rapid improvement of symptoms. The faecal excretion of 111indium was repeated in five and all improved but histologically the colitis remained unchanged. These studies show that some patients with primary hypogammaglobulinaemia have intestinal inflammation unlike that found in classic inflammatory bowel disease. Elemental diet is a useful temporary measure in the treatment of these patients.},

   abstract = {Twenty nine children with Crohn's disease were studied before and after treatment with steroids or an elemental diet to assess the effect of disease activity and treatment on serum insulin like growth factor I (IGF-I), insulin like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP-1), and insulin concentrations. The median serum IGF-I concentration was lower in patients with active disease than in matched controls, and lower in stunted than well grown patients, but insulin and IGFBP-1 concentrations were not significantly different between any group. After four weeks of either treatment there was an increase in the median serum IGF-I concentration; this was greater in the steroid group than the elemental diet group. The median serum insulin concentration increased and median serum IGFBP-1 concentration decreased in the steroid treated group but not in the elemental diet group. These changes were accompanied by a greater and more sustained increase in energy intake in the steroid group. Despite this the median height velocity SD score was greater in the elemental diet group than in the steroid group.},

In Crohn's disease, plasma selenium concentrations were rarely low, but glutathione peroxidase activity was increased in the plasma and reduced in the red cells. Selenium concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity increased with steroid treatment but decreased with a selenium-deficient elemental diet. Plasma selenium concentration was normal in children with cystic fibrosis but very low in severely malnourished children with biliary atresia and intractable diarrhoea. Selenium concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity should be monitored in children with severe malnutrition or requiring prolonged nutritional support. Supplementation is recommended in cases of severe selenium depletion.},

   abstract = {Dietary intake was assessed in 24 children with active Crohn's disease. Seventeen of the children were sex and height matched with healthy siblings of other patients. The mean energy intake was 1,764 KJ/day (420 kcal/day) lower in patients during relapse than controls (p < 0.05). All 24 children entered a randomised controlled trial of high-dose steroids compared to an elemental diet. The elemental diet was well tolerated orally in most cases; only one patient required nasogastric administration. There was a similar improvement in disease activity and duration of remission in both groups regardless of the site of disease. Subsequent growth velocity was significantly better in the group treated with the elemental diet despite a greater and more sustained increase in energy intake in the group treated with steroids. Reintroduction of specific foods in the elemental diet group initially caused symptoms in three children but were subsequently tolerated. During remission, there was no significant difference in energy intake, but vegetables were consumed significantly less frequently (p < 0.01) and confectionery significantly more frequently (p < 0.05) when patients were compared with their own siblings.},

   abstract = {This study compared the short-term effect of semi-elemental diet in treatment of active Crohn's disease with elemental diet which has been reported to be successful in inducing remission. The important differences between semi-elemental diet and elemental diet in composition are the form of nitrogen and fat content. Forty patients with active Crohn's disease were randomized to receive for 6 weeks either elemental diet (n = 21) which is composed of amino acid based with low fat content or semi-elemental diet (n = 19) which is oligopeptide-based and has higher fat content. Both groups showed similar improvement in Dutch-AI, Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, serum albumin, body mass index and radiographic findings of bowel lesion. The present study suggests that semi-elemental diet is equal to elemental diet for treating active Crohn's disease. We conclude the compositional differences between the two diets did not affect the short-term effect of enteral nutritional therapy for active Crohn's disease.},

The results of our study show a long-lasting effect of in vivo zinc administration, which decreased peripheral blood natural killer cell activity in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {During 1991-92 we performed 50 bowel anastomoses using the biofragmentable anastomotic ring (BAR). The indications were malignancy (35 cases), Crohn's disease (3), dolichosigma (4), diverticulitis (2), gastric outlet obstruction (2), and 1 each for abdominal trauma, postoperative stricture, and stricture caused by ischemic colitis. The average age was 61; 28 were women and 22 men. The anastomoses were between colon and rectum (21 cases), ileum and colon (18), colon and colon (8), stomach and jejunum (2) and ileum and ileum (1). First stools were passed after an average of 4.7 +/- 2.5 (SD) days and a low-residue diet was well-tolerated after an average of 7 +/- 3.9 days. There were complications in 12 (24%). In 3 others leaks necessitated reoperation. Incomplete small bowel obstruction developed in 6, 4-18 days after operation and lasted 3-11 days. In 2 a perianastomotic inflammation appeared 1-3 weeks after operation and was treated successfully with IV antibiotics and bowel rest. In 1 case a stricture appeared 3 months after surgery and was treated successfully with balloon dilatation. No complications were seen after anastomosing bowel segments proximal to the ileocecal valve. The average time for expelling the BAR in 19 of the 45 patients was 2.5 +/- 0.6 weeks, assessed by weekly X-raying of the abdomen. Although the group of patients was small, our impression is that the method of anastomosis is easy to learn, easy to perform and relatively safe.},
