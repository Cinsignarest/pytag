   abstract = {The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an umbrella for the diagnosis of heterogeneous conditions that are awaiting better identification of specific manometric causes. This article focuses on the concept that future therapy for IBS will rely on identification of subgroups and in turn tailor the specific therapeutic approaches to an appreciation of the pathophysiology and symptom predominance of these subgroups. Future therapies will rely on the following principles: (1) prokinetic agents to coordinate upper gastrointestinal and colonic motility as well as improve the propulsive nature of colonic contractions; (2) gastrointestinal hormone agonists such as erythromycin and antagonists such as sandostatin and cholecystokinin antagonists; (3) spasmolytic therapy incorporating calcium channel blocking and anticholinergic agents; (4) inhibition of ovulatory cycle changes in circulating concentrations of gonadal hormones in women, who tend to dominate the IBS population; (5) incorporation of concepts relating to the role of subtypes of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors in control of neural and myogenic function; (6) reassessment of food intolerance and sensitivity; and (7) incorporation of concepts relating to psychologic profiles and psychologic treatment approaches. IBS is a rich and fertile area for application of the exciting new pharmacologic advances relating to gastrointestinal smooth-muscle and neural innervation of the gut. Improvement in the understanding and treatment of IBS will be one of the major accomplishments of this decade.},

   abstract = {The major aims of medical therapy in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are: a) to ameliorate symptoms (pain, bowel movement abnormalities, bloating) and b) to improve psychological problems of the patients. The first step of IBS therapy is the diet. In fact some forms of IBS can be ascribed to food intolerance. When abdominal pain, meteorism and constipation are the main symptoms, treatment with high-fiber diet, antispastic and antimuscarinic drugs is indicated. Sometimes amitriptyline, an antidepressant which also shows anticholinergic and analgesic properties, can be helpful. When diarrhoea is prevalent, the most effective drug is represented by loperamide. If diarrhoea is related to meal ingestion, antispastic or antimuscarinic drugs can be successfully used. In the case of diarrhoea related to documented cholorrhoea, cholestyramine can be of benefit. Furthermore, there are some resistant cases, secondary to striking psychological problems that require sedatives and antidepressant drugs and sometimes, psycho and/or hypnotherapy.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in the field of neuroimmunology have provided clear demonstrations of i) the neuromodulation of immune function, and ii) the involvement of the immune system in responses induced by psychologic stress in animals and in man. This has led to speculation about the role of the immune system in psychosocial disease. The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction, which may reflect in altered motility, epithelial function, or sensory perception in the gut. IBS is heterogeneous not only in terms of its clinical presentation but also in terms of its pathogenesis, and factors ranging from psychoneurotic behavior and emotional stress, to dietary fiber deficiency, food intolerance, and enteric infection have been implicated. There is evidence of an increase in the inflammatory cells present in the gut of some IBS patients and in an emerging literature that demonstrates the immunomodulation of the motor system of the gut. These findings invite speculation that the immune system may play a role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of at least a subpopulation of IBS patients.},

It is a heterogeneous condition affecting different organ systems and is also aetiologically diverse with subgroups due to allergy, pharmacological reactions, enzyme deficiencies and psychological causes. Clinical acceptance of food sensitivity has been delayed by the use of dubious diagnostic techniques by a minority of practitioners and the lack of laboratory diagnostic tests, but several double blind studies have now fully validated the existence of food sensitivity syndromes. More widespread recognition of food sensitivity would be cost effective for the National Health Service.},

In a single centre, double blind, placebo controlled trial of 3 months duration, a daily supplement of 4.1 g fibre produced no greater change in gastrointestinal symptoms than placebo. Pretreatment constipation was related to baseline fibre intake. Overall outcome was the same in treated and control groups; a considerable placebo response was evident. This level of fibre supplementation is not a useful treatment; improving neither constipation nor other symptoms. At the outset pain severity correlated with depression score on psychometric testing. Those who felt better at the end of the study scored significantly lower for depression at outset than those who felt no better. In irritable bowel syndrome a depressive emotional state profile is a powerful determinant of outcome, shaping the response to treatment, which includes a considerable placebo element.},

   abstract = {Food intake plays a key role in triggering or perpetuating symptoms in patients with IBS. Evaluation of the impact of diet in the individual patient requires a precise dietary history and a 7-day prospective dietary analysis, which should include the quality and quantity of food consumed, chronologic sequence and nature of symptoms, and the frequency and consistency of bowel movements. The caloric density of the meal, total fat intake, the quantity and quality of lactose-containing foods, sorbitol, fructose, and the nature and quantity of soluble and insoluble fiber intake must be noted. Patients with reflux esophageal symptoms should eliminate foods that decrease LES pressure, such as chocolate, peppermint, alcohol, and coffee. Direct esophageal mucosal irritants such as tomatoes, citrus juices, sharp condiments, and alcohol should be limited. Gastric emptying is slowed with the ingestion of fats and soluble fiber. Small bowel motility is slowed by soluble fiber and fatty foods. Gaseous syndromes may be reduced by avoidance of smoking, chewing gum, excessive liquid intake, and carbonated drinks. The reduced intake of large amounts of lactose-containing foods, sorbitol, and fructose may limit postprandial bloating. Flatus production can be lowered by reducing fermentable carbohydrates such as beans, cabbage, lentils, brussel sprouts, and legumes. Soluble and insoluble fiber ingestion will reduce sigmoidal intraluminal pressures and overcome spastic constipation when given in progressive graded doses. Effective dietary manipulations remain a key factor in reducing symptoms in IBS.},

   abstract = {Individualization of treatment for patients with IBS is predicated on a thorough analysis of the patient's symptoms, consideration of the reasons for seeking health care, evaluation of symptom-precipitating factors, elimination of confounding features, and the absolute knowledge of the absence of organic illness. Collecting and codifying appropriate historical data allow the physician to educate the patient with respect to the origin of his symptoms, and to enlist the patient as a partner in his future health care. There is no single, universally accepted therapeutic agent available for the treatment of the IBS patient. As a result, treatment is directed at reducing the frequency and intensity of triggering factors as well as ameliorating the symptoms when they arise. Symptoms evoked by psychologic factors may be effectively reduced by psychotherapy or hypnotherapy. Situational anxiety may be treated for brief periods by using antianxiety agents such as diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, buspirone, or similar agents. Depressive reactions may be reduced with suitable doses of antidepressant agents such as amitriptyline. Smooth muscle hyperreactivity may be dulled with small amounts of selected anticholinergics, which are usually most effective in reducing meal-induced discomfort. Peppermint oil may be of additional benefit. Gas-related symptoms require elimination of contributory dietary factors, such as lactose-containing foods, sorbitol, or fructose, as well as certain oligosaccharides. Simethecone, charcoal, or beanase may be helpful. Functional constipation is best treated with graded doses of insoluble or soluble fiber. Diarrheal episodes may be reduced with either loperamide or diphenoxylate. Careful, continued follow-up assessment of therapeutic endeavors, a sincere interest in the patient's concerns, and surveillance for intercurrent organic illness are the cornerstones of complete ongoing care.},

Dietary fibre intakes were measured after 6 months by a 7-day weighed food inventory. There was a significant inverse association between the presence of symptoms and fibre intake for: incomplete defaecation, urgency and hard stools with total fibre intake; urgency and hard stools with cereal fibre intake; and borborygmi with fibre intake at breakfast. All patients with constipation, mucus, urgency or watery stools at the beginning of the study, and who were consuming more than 30 g fibre by the end, reported an improvement in these symptoms. Increasing intakes of fibre were not related in any way to abdominal distension, diarrhoea, flatulence or patient's feelings about the working of their bowels. Therefore, this study suggests that the symptoms which benefit most from the prescription of a high-fibre diet are hard stools, constipation and urgency.},

   abstract = {Food allergy, synonymous with food hypersensitivity (FHS), is defined as an immunologically-mediated adverse reaction to food. Initiation of FHS could result from a break in the immune mucosal barrier with abrogation of oral tolerance. Food hypersensitivity is mostly due to immediate-type reaction involving IgE-dependent mastocytes activation. Changes in intestinal function and structure have been mainly studies in an animal model of rat sensitized to egg albumin. Intraluminal antigen challenge resulted in abnormalities of gut absorption, secretion and motility in sensitized rats. In man, experimental data are scarce. Gastrointestinal manifestations of immediate FHS are varying and unspecific. A role for FHS in irritable bowel syndrome is debated. Participation of delayed-type FHS to digestive diseases is still questionable, but eosinophilic gastroenteritis might be an example. In clinical practice, diagnosis of FHS demands rigorous criteria. Double blind placebo-controlled food challenge has eventually proved to be the "gold standard" test for FHS diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Colonic motor activity and plasma concentrations of cholecystokinin (CCK) both increase after oral intake of a meal. Thus, CCK had been thought to mediate the postprandial increase in colonic motor activity, which is termed gastrocolonic response. The present study used the substance loxiglumide, which acts as a specific antagonist at the CCK-A receptor, to evaluate this hypothesis. In the first set of experiments, eight healthy subjects were studied four times on separate days. A multilumen catheter was endoscopically placed with its tip lying in the descending colon. Motor activity was recorded by a low-compliance perfusion manometry system at six locations 60-45 cm from the anus. Basal activity was recorded for at least 2 hours to achieve steady-state conditions. The order of the following four experiments was randomized: (a) intravenous infusion of the CCK analogue cerulein at increasing doses (7.5, 15, 30, and 60 ng/kg.h, each given for 30 minutes); (b) intravenous cerulein plus 5 mg/kg.h loxiglumide; (c) a 1000-kcal solid/liquid meal consisting of regular German food; and (d) a meal plus 5 mg/kg.h loxiglumide. In the second set of experiments, eight patients with irritable bowel syndrome were studied twice on two separate days, and two experiments were performed n randomized order: (a) a 1000-kcal solid/liquid meal consisting of regular German food; or (b) a meal plus 5 mg/kg.h loxiglumide. The motor index was calculated as the area under contractions by a computerized system. The 1000-kcal meal markedly increased colonic motor activity. This gastrocolonic response was significantly greater in patients with irritable bowel syndrome than in healthy volunteers. Cerulein stimulated motor activity only at pharmacological doses (30-60 ng/kg.h), which resulted in plasma CCK levels markedly exceeding postprandial values. Loxiglumide abolished the effects of cerulein even at pharmacological doses. However, loxiglumide did not inhibit the gastrocolonic response to a regular meal either in healthy volunteers or in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Loxiglumide also failed to alter the interdigestive colonic motor activity. Therefore, effects mediated by the CCK-A receptor do not play a major physiological role in the regulation of the interdigestive and postprandial motility of the left colon.},

IBS was sub-classified into 3 groups; abdominal pain as the prominent feature with diarrhea, with constipation, with both while painless diarrhea and simple constipation without pain were excluded from IBS. There is a lot of data suggesting that IBS has a gut dysmotility, which is influenced by many stimuli (food, hormone, drug, menses, mechanical dilatation), including psychological stress. Moreover, currently available evidences implicate that IBS is a more generalized disorder of smooth muscle function not only in the intestine but also outside of the intestine.},

The most important cause of this symptom is an increase in the volume of gas in the gastrointestinal tract. Differential diagnoses include aerophagia, ingestion of gas-producing foods, gastric hypersecretion, bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine, disordered gastrointestinal transit, malabsorption or maldigestion of carbohydrates. In addition, nonulcer dyspepsia and the irritable bowel syndrome must be excluded. The diagnosis is based on a history of eructation, heart burn, flatulence and diarrhea, dietary habits, physical examination, laboratory analysis and apparative diagnostic measures. Therapy depends on the underlying cause of the disease.},

   abstract = {Several studies on the usefulness of oral disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) in the treatment of systemic adverse reaction to foods have been performed, with less attention to gastroenterological symptoms. In the present study, we selected 101 patients with diarrheic-type irritable bowel syndrome which improved after an elimination diet and worsened after a challenge with specific food(s). All patients were then tested for 48 commercial alimentary antigens by skin prick test (SPT) and underwent 8 wk of oral DSCG (500 mg three times a day), and the results were evaluated by means of a semiquantitative subjective and objective score. We observed an improvement of the symptoms in 67% of the 74 SPT-positive patients, whereas only 41% of the 27 SPT-negative patients showed a positive response to DSCG (p less than 0.05). These data confirm the protective role of DSCG in food-dependent diarrheic-type irritable bowel syndrome with food allergy features.},

   abstract = {One hundred and nine distance runners participated in a questionnaire survey of bowel function related to running. Thirteen (12%) had had fecal incontinence while running. Sixty-eight (62%) had stopped to have a bowel movement while training. Forty-seven (43%) had "nervous" diarrhea before competition and 13 (12%) had stopped during competition for a bowel movement. Fifty-one (47%) had experienced diarrhea after racing or hard runs and 17 (16%) had seen blood in their stool in the same situations. Runners who had nervous diarrhea before competition were more likely to have symptoms of milk intolerance and irregular bowel function when not exercising, and runners who had symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome often had to stop for a bowel movement during training. Runners with diarrhea after racing or hard runs frequently experienced severe abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, and occasionally, rectal bleeding at the same time. Any form of "runners' diarrhea" was unrelated to age, previous intestinal infection or food poisoning, food allergies, or dietary fiber.},

   abstract = {Because infants with colic appear to have abdominal pain similar to that of adults with irritable bowel syndrome, who may benefit from the addition of fiber to their diet, we tested whether fiber added to infant formula would alleviate colic. Twenty-seven normal, term infants (aged 2 to 8 weeks; 14 girls) with colic, defined as crying plus fussing for more than 3 hours a day for at least 3 days of a 6-day baseline period, were enrolled. Infants were randomly assigned in 9-day periods to a sequence of placebo (Isomil formula) followed by fiber-supplemented formula (Isomil plus soy polysaccharide) (n = 12) or the reverse (n = 15). Daily diaries of crying, fussing, sleeping, formula, intake, and stooling were kept. Twenty-two infants completed three lactulose breath hydrogen tests at the end of the baseline period and after each study period. The crossover trial was followed by 30 to 35 days of use of the study formula chosen by the parents as most beneficial but unknown to the investigators. Growth was monitored throughout. Serum cholesterol, calcium, phosphate, albumin, iron, and zinc concentrations were measured at the conclusion. There were no significant differences in average daily time spent by the infants in fussing and crying during ingestion of the fiber-supplemented formula. However, parents of 18 of 27 infants chose fiber-supplemented formula as most beneficial in ameliorating symptoms of colic. While the infants were consuming fiber-supplemented formula, stool frequency increased, and breath hydrogen excretion increased significantly, in response to lactulose. Growth and serum biochemical measurements were normal in all infants. Supplementation of infant formula with the level of soy polysaccharide used in this study may have reduced crying and fussing in some infants but did not affect colicky behavior in the majority of infants, who continued to cry and fuss excessively.},

Group A received diet with high content of roughage (20 g of fibers) and 10 g of bran, group B received otilonium bromide (OB) 40mg tid and normal diet (10-15 g of fibers). Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, bowel movements were evaluated before treatment (T0) at the end (T24) and after 12 months (T12). In group B otilonium bromide induced a significant improvement (p less than 0.01) of abdominal pain and distension when comparing T0 with T24. In group A diet produced an improvement, albeit not significant, of the aforementioned parameters at T24. On the basis of our data OB seems to be more effective than a high-fiber diet in the treatment of IBS.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, and diarrhea may complicate a pregnancy. Complaints of IBS and constipation may be managed by nonpharmaceutical methods. A careful history should be conducted to determine whether these complaints are of an acute or a long-standing nature. Conservative treatment of IBS is recommended and may include stool-bulking agents, a high-fiber diet, elimination of offensive foods, and the behavioral treatment of passive muscle relaxation, biofeedback or supportive psychotherapy. Constipation is generally self-limiting. It also may be treated conservatively with stool-bulking agents, increases in dietary fiber, and the addition of pelvic muscle exercises, preferably using electromyographic biofeedback. Laxatives should be used judiciously (Table 1). Diarrhea is caused most often by infectious agents in pregnancy but may also be from food poisoning or a viral disease. Infectious diarrhea may be treated by mild antidiarrheal agents and safe antibiotics. Fluid replacement is the mainstay of treatment, and care should be taken, remembering that the treatment involves two patients. These complaints can generally be managed conservatively, but persistent cases should be investigated as in a nonpregnant patient.},
