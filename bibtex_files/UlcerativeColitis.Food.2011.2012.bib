   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists mainly of Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD). Although its aetiology is still not clearly established, it is thought to be due to overly aggressive immune response to enteric bacteria in genetically predisposed individuals. Manipulating the microbiota using probiotics or prebiotics is considered as a promising field of new therapeutic strategies used to attenuate immune disorders observed during IBD. The production of nitric oxide (NO) seems to be implicated in IBD pathogenesis. In our study, an acute UC was induced in Swiss mice using 3% Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS). The preventive effects of "Ultrabiotique(R)" (a probiotic) and inulin (a prebiotic) on the colitis were investigated. The production of NO was evaluated in the supernatants of peritoneal macrophages (pMphi) cultures. Colonic mucosa histology was subsequently examined. Results showed severe acute UC after administration of DSS. High levels of NO in pMphi cultures were also observed compared to control samples. These findings correlated with a significant destruction of the colonic mucosa. Oral administration of Ultrabiotique(R) or inulin decreased the severity of DSS-induced colitis. These treatments lead to a decrease in NO levels in pMphi cultures. A considerable reduction of colonic lesions was also noticed. Our findings suggest the involvement of NO in experimental UC pathogenesis. Pre- and pro-biotics, as discussed herein, seem to have an anti-inflammatory effect.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the environmental factors leading to inflammatory bowel disease should help to prevent occurrence of the disease and its relapses. AIM: To review current knowledge on dietary risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library were searched for studies on diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Established non-diet risk factors include family predisposition, smoking, appendectomy, and antibiotics. Retrospective case-control studies are encumbered with methodological problems. Prospective studies on European cohorts, mainly including middle-aged adults, suggest that a diet high in protein from meat and fish is associated with a higher risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Intake of the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid may confer risk of ulcerative colitis, whereas n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be protective. No effect was found of intake of dietary fibres, sugar, macronutrients, total energy, vitamin C, D, E, Carotene, or Retinol (vitamin A) on risk of ulcerative colitis. No prospective data was found on risk related to intake of fruits, vegetables or food microparticles (titanium dioxide and aluminium silicate). CONCLUSIONS: A diet high in protein, particular animal protein, may be associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease and relapses. N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids may predispose to ulcerative colitis whilst n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid may protect. These results should be confirmed in other countries and in younger subjects before dietary counselling is recommended in high risk subjects.},

Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that provide beneficial health effects on the host when administered in adequate amounts. Various probiotics have been shown to suppress bacterial growth, modulate the immune system and improve intestinal barrier function. However, despite several studies with promising results, most trials are small and many have substantial methodological limitations. However, with better targeting and appropriate randomised controlled trials, this area may soon yield important therapeutic strategies to optimise GI health. Here, we review the current knowledge of probiotics of relevance to luminal GI health.},

   abstract = {We studied a polyphenol-enriched cocoa extract (PCE) with epicatechin, procyanidin B2, catechin, and procyanidin B1 as the major phenolics for its anti-inflammatory properties against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. PCE reduced colon damage, with significant reductions in both the extent and the severity of the inflammation as well as in crypt damage and leukocyte infiltration in the mucosa. Analysis ex vivo showed clear decreases in the production of nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase-2, pSTAT-3, and pSTAT1alpha, with NF-kappaB p65 production being slightly reduced. Moreover, NF-kappaB activation was reduced in RAW 264.7 cells in vitro. In conclusion, the inhibitory effect of PCE on acute UC induced by DSS in mice was attenuated by oral administration of PCE obtained from cocoa. This effect is principally due to the inhibition of transcription factors STAT1 and STAT3 in intestinal cells, with NF-kappaB inhibition also being implicated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Probiotics appear to be beneficial in inflammatory bowel disease, but their mechanism of action is incompletely understood. We investigated whether probiotic-derived sphingomyelinase mediates this beneficial effect. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Neutral sphingomyelinase (NSMase) activity was measured in sonicates of the probiotic L. brevis (LB) and S. thermophilus (ST) and the non-probiotic E. coli (EC) and E. faecalis (EF). Lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) were obtained from patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy volunteers, analysing LPMC and PBMC apoptosis susceptibility, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and JNK activation. In some experiments, sonicates were preincubated with GSH or GW4869, a specific NSMase inhibitor. NSMase activity of LB and ST was 10-fold that of EC and EF sonicates. LB and ST sonicates induced significantly more apoptosis of CD and UC than control LPMC, whereas EC and EF sonicates failed to induce apoptosis. Pre-stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 induced a significant and time-dependent increase in LB-induced apoptosis of LPMC and PBMC. Exposure to LB sonicates resulted in JNK activation and ROS production by LPMC. NSMase activity of LB sonicates was completely abrogated by GW4869, causing a dose-dependent reduction of LB-induced apoptosis. LB and ST selectively induced immune cell apoptosis, an effect dependent on the degree of cell activation and mediated by bacterial NSMase. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that induction of immune cell apoptosis is a mechanism of action of some probiotics, and that NSMase-mediated ceramide generation contributes to the therapeutic effects of probiotics.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract associated with altered composition of the gut microbiota. Lactobacillus reuteri BR11 (BR11) has recently been reported to reduce the severity of experimental IBD because of its probiotic properties possibly attributed to a mechanism of thiol production via its unique cysteine/cystine-transport system. AIM: We compared BR11 and a BR11 mutant deficient in the cystine-uptake system (PNG201), for their capacity to reduce the severity of experimental colitis. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8 per group) were gavaged (1 ml/day) with skim milk, BR11 or PNG201 (1 x 10(9) CFU/ml) for 12 days. Rats consumed either water or 2% dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water from days 6 to 12 to induce colitis. Metabolism data, disease activity index, intestinal mucin profile, and histological analyses were assessed and compared by ANOVA. RESULTS: Assessed histologically, DSS administration resulted in significant colonic deterioration, including loss of crypt area and increased damage severity. BR11 administration only partially alleviated the DSS effects, with a minor improvement in crypt area (P < 0.05). Administration of the PNG201 mutant strain to colitic animals failed to achieve significance (P > 0.05) against the DSS control for any of the end-points. However, the mutant strain induced significantly greater (P < 0.05) histological severity compared with BR11-treated colitic animals, indicative of possible exacerbation of colitis. CONCLUSIONS: The cystine-uptake system only minimally affects the biological effects of BR11, as evidenced by histological and macroscopic colitic changes.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Quantitative real-time PCR assays were developed to measure the production of pro-inflammatory (IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-18 and TNFalpha) and anti-inflammatory (TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines in HT-29 and Caco-2 cell lines. They were co-cultured with a range of mucosal bacteria isolated from ulcerative colitis patients, together with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria obtained from healthy people. HT-29 cells were also co-cultured with Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The majority of commensal bacteria tested suppressed the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA, increased IL-18, reduced IL-1alpha, and with the exception of nonpathogenic E. coli, reduced TNF-alpha. All overtly pathogenic species increased both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA. CONCLUSION: Commensal and pathogenic species induced fundamentally different cytokine responses in human intestinal epithelial cell lines. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Interactions between commensal bacteria tested in this study and the innate immune system were shown to be anti-inflammatory in nature, in contrast to the pathogenic organisms investigated. These data contribute towards our understanding of how potential probiotic species can be used to suppress the pro-inflammatory response in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dinitrofluorobenzene/dinitrosulfonic acid (DNFB/DNS) model was originally described as an experimental model of intestinal inflammation resembling human ulcerative colitis (UC). Due to the absence of acceptable UC experimental models for pharmacological preclinical assays, here we examine the immune response induced in this model. METHODS: Balb/c mice were sensitized by skin application of DNFB on day 1, followed by an intrarectal challenge with DNS on day 5. We further expanded this model by administering a second DNS challenge on day 15. The features of colonic inflammation and immune response were evaluated. RESULTS: The changes observed in colonic tissue corresponded, in comparison to the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis model, to a mild mucosal effect in the colon, which spontaneously resolved in less than 5 days. Furthermore, the second hapten challenge did not exacerbate the inflammatory response. In contrast to other studies, we did not observe any clear involvement of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or other Th1 cytokines during the initial inflammatory response; however, we found that a more Th2-humoral response appeared to mediate the first contact with the hapten. An increased humoral response was detected during the second challenge, although an increased Th1/Th17-cytokine expression profile was also simultaneously observed. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these results, although the DNFB/DNS model can display some features found in human UC, it should be considered as a model for the study of the intestinal hypersensitivity seen, for example, during food allergy or irritable bowel syndrome but not intestinal inflammation per se.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprising of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) is a major ailment affecting the small and large bowel. In clinics, IBD is treated using 5-amninosalicylates, antibiotics, the steroids and immunomodulators. Unfortunately, the long term usages of these agents are associated with undue side effects and compromise the therapeutic advantage. Accordingly, there is a need for novel agents that are effective, acceptable and non toxic to humans. Preclinical studies in experimental animals have shown that curcumin, an active principle of the Indian spice turmeric (Curcuma longa Linn) is effective in preventing or ameliorating UC and inflammation. Over the last few decades there has been increasing interest in the possible role of curcumin in IBD and several studies with various experimental models of IBD have shown it to be effective in mediating the inhibitory effects by scavenging free radicals, increasing antioxidants, influencing multiple signaling pathways, especially the kinases (MAPK, ERK), inhibiting myeloperoxidase, COX-1, COX-2, LOX, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, iNOS; inhibiting the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Clinical studies have also shown that co-administration of curcumin with conventional drugs was effective, to be well-tolerated and treated as a safe medication for maintaining remission, to prevent relapse and improve clinical activity index. Large randomized controlled clinical investigations are required to fully understand the potential of oral curcumin for treating IBD.},

   abstract = {Although numerous studies have assessed the effect of foods and nutrients on colorectal carcinogenesis, few studies have investigated human eating behavior in relation to risk of colorectal cancer. In our study, we assessed whether the reported behavior of eating anything at anytime influenced colorectal cancer risk and related plasma biomarkers. We prospectively followed up 55,540 women in the Nurses' Health Study who were aged 48-73 years, had no history of cancer, ulcerative colitis or diabetes and responded to the item "I eat anything I want, anytime I want" in the 1994 questionnaire. We also analyzed blood samples for 1,994 women, which were collected in 1989-1990. During 12 years of follow-up, 552 colorectal cancer cases were documented. After adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, physical activity, red and processed meat and other known risk factors for colorectal cancer, women who reported eating anything at anytime experienced an increased risk of colorectal cancer (relative risk = 1.28, 95% confidence interval = 1.06-1.56) compared to those who did not report this behavior. In addition, reporting eating anything at anytime was associated with higher fasting plasma levels of insulin (p = 0.04) and C-peptide (p = 0.05). In conclusion, reports of eating anything at anytime are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer in this large prospective cohort study, independent of other potential risk factors for colorectal cancer.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effect of AMFE was studied on acetic acid induced ulcerative colitis (1 ml of 4% acetic acid solution, transrectal) and indomethacin-induced enterocolitis (10 mg/kg, single dose, p.o) in Wistar albino rats. The extract was administered orally at different dose of 150, 200 and 250 mg/kg body weight. Disease pathogenesis was assessed by measuring disease activity index (DAI), macroscopic score, microscopic score, mesenteric mast cell protection, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malonaldehyde (MDA) levels in the above two models. RESULTS: The results showed a dose dependent decrease in intestinal inflammation following treatment with AMFE. Significant protection in mast cell degranulation was observed in acetic acid and indomethacin-induced IBD models. Treatment with AMFE significantly decreased the MDA levels and increased SOD activity. CONCLUSION: In our study, AMFE produced anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and mast cell stabilizing effects demonstrating protective effect in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to describe long-term adjustment to life with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis after surgery for ulcerative colitis, to investigate the relationship of pouch function to adjustment, and to explore factors affecting quality of life. METHODS: A total of 369 patients treated between 1982 and 1993 were included in the study. Questionnaires designed to assess bowel (pouch) function (Oresland score) and disease-specific adjustment (Swedish version of the Ostomy Adjustment Scale), plus open-ended questions regarding quality of life, were sent by mail. Open-ended questions were analyzed with qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 252 patients (84%) returned the disease-specific adjustment questionnaire (141 males/111 females); median age, 51 (range, 26-77) years; median follow-up, 15 (range, 10-21) years after construction of the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. High adjustment ratings were found for all statements, with the maximum median score of 6 on 28 of the 36 items. Items with the lowest ratings (median score, 5) pertained to things one would do if not for the IPAA, feeling free to travel, ability to enjoy sexual activities, comfort with body image, ability to laugh about awkward situations, confidence in the appliance, and whether the surgery helped with decisions on what things are most important in life. Participants with the lowest adjustment scores had low bowel function scores (P < .0001). Open-ended quality of life questions were answered by 150 patients (59.5%). The most important areas for quality of life were health, family, restroom access, and friends. Five categories emerged from the qualitative content analysis: living a "normal" life, food restrictions, physical limitations, influence of restroom access on social life, and being dependent on medical care. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants had adjusted well to life with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and considered life to be normal. Good public restrooms were important for quality of life. Improving pouch function may help patients adjust to the postoperative state, but deeper understanding of reasons for poor adjustment despite good pouch function is needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Soybean oil is rich in omega-6 fatty acids, which are associated with higher incidence and more severe cases of inflammatory bowel diseases. The authors evaluated whether partial replacement of soybean oil by medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) or olive oil influenced the incidence and severity of experimental ulcerative colitis by using different parenteral lipid emulsions (LEs). METHODS: Wistar rats (n = 40) were randomized to receive parenteral infusion of the following LE: 100% soybean oil (SO), 50% MCT mixed with 50% soybean oil (MCT/SO), 80% olive oil mixed with 20% soybean oil (OO/SO), or saline (CC). After 72 hours of infusion, acetic acid experimental colitis was induced. After 24 hours, colon histology and cytokine expression were analyzed. RESULTS: SO was not significantly associated with overall tissue damage. MCT/SO was not associated with necrosis (P < .005), whereas OO/SO had higher frequencies of ulcer and necrosis (P < .005). SO was associated with increased expression of interferon-gamma (P = .005) and OO/SO with increased interleukin (IL)-6 and decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression (P < .05). MCT/SO appeared to decrease IL-1 (P < .05) and increase IL-4 (P < .001) expression. CONCLUSIONS: Parenteral SO with high concentration of omega-6 fatty acids was not associated with greater tissue damage in experimental colitis. SO partial replacement with MCT/SO decreased the frequency of histological necrosis and favorably modulated cytokine expression in the colon; however, replacement with OO/SO had unfavorable effects.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A significant fraction of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) is not sufficiently controlled with conventional therapy or suffers from therapy related side effects. Anthocyanins, highly abundant in bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus), were shown to have antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. We aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of bilberries in active UC. METHODS: In an open pilot trial with a total follow-up of 9 weeks the effect of a daily standardized anthocyanin-rich bilberry preparation was tested in 13 patients with mild to moderate UC. Clinical, biochemical, endoscopic and histologic parameters were assessed. RESULTS: At the end of the 6 week treatment interval 63.4% of patients achieved remission, the primary endpoint, while 90.9% of patients showed a response. In all patients a decrease in total Mayo score was detected (mean: 6.5 and 3.6 at screening and week 7, respectively; p<0.001). Fecal calprotectin levels significantly decreased during the treatment phase (baseline: mean 778 mug/g, range 192-1790 mug/g; end of treatment: mean 305 mug/g, range <30-1586 mug/g; p=0.049), including 4 patients achieving undetectable levels at end of treatment. A decrease in endoscopic Mayo score and histologic Riley index confirmed the beneficial effect. However, an increase of calprotectin levels and disease activity was observed after cessation of bilberry intake. No serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the promising therapeutic potential of a standardized anthocyanin-rich bilberry preparation in UC in humans. These results clearly indicate a therapeutic potential of bilberries in UC. Further studies on mechanisms and randomized clinical trials are warranted.},

   abstract = {Leptin plays not only an important role in regulation of food intake, but also in the mechanism of inflammation. The universal presence of leptin in the cells of immune system and its secretion by these cells caused increasing interest in the role of this hormone in ulcerative colitis (UC). We determined the role of leptin in 80 patients, aged from 18 to 69 years, including 50 patients with active UC and 30 patients with infectious diarrhea. The tests were performed within 48 hours of the first symptoms, in the period of remission of UC and 8 weeks after resolution of infectious diarrhea. Endoscopy was performed in each patient, and the biopsy samples were taken for the assessments of expression of mRNA for leptin, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha by RT-PCR and Western blot. Blood tests included concentrations of leptin, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. In addition, the plasma levels of leptin, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were assessed by ELISA. Serum concentrations of leptin was significantly increased in patients with exacerbation of UC over that in patients with UC in remission. The serum leptin concentration was significantly higher in patients with infectious diarrhea, than the patients that recovered from infectious diarrhea. The leptin protein was overexpressed in the biopsy samples of the mucosa of large intestine compared to those with exacerbation of UC, and in patients after successful recovery from infectious diarrhea. The leptin mRNA was overexpressed in patients with infectious diarrhea compared with that in the group of patients after successful recovery from this condition. Serum concentrations of leptin failed to correlate with severity of exacerbation of UC and with extent of intestinal inflammatory lesions in patients with UC. However, the correlation was observed between serum concentrations of leptin in patients with exacerbation of UC and serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. We conclude that 1) the increased leptin in exacerbated UC is related to the increased serum proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels; 2) In patients with infectious diarrhea, the concentrations of leptin in intestinal mucosa correlates with serum concentrations of cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha and with an increased expression of leptin mRNA in intestinal mucosa but not with alterations in serum levels of this hormone; 3) leptin may serve as useful predictive marker of inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).},

   abstract = {Several substances, including glutamine and propionic acid but in particular butyric acid, have been proposed to be important for colonic health. beta-Glucans lead to the formation of comparatively high amounts of butyric acid, and germinated barley foodstuff obtained from brewer's spent grain (BSG), containing high amounts of beta-glucans and glutamine, has been reported to reduce the inflammatory response in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis. The present study examines how 3 barley products, whole grain barley, malt, and BSG, affect SCFA in the hindgut and serum of rats and whether the addition of Lactobacillus rhamnosus 271 to each of these diets would have further effects. Amino acids in plasma and the cecal composition of the microbiota were also analyzed. The butyric acid concentration in the distal colon and serum was higher in the malt groups than in the other groups as was the serum concentration of propionic acid. The concentrations of propionic and butyric acids were higher in the cecum and serum of rats given L. rhamnosus than in those not given this strain. The proportion of plasma glutamine and the cecal number of bifidobacteria were lower in the malt groups than in the other groups. L. rhamnosus decreased the number of cecal bifidobacteria, whereas plasma glutamine was unaffected. We conclude that malt together with L. rhamnosus 271 had greater effects on propionic and butyric acid concentrations in rats than the other barley products. This is interesting when developing food with effects on colonic health.},

The dietary suggestions derived from sources found in this article include nutritional deficiency screening, avoiding foods that worsen symptoms, eating smaller meals at more frequent intervals, drinking adequate fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, taking vitamin/mineral supplementation, eliminating dairy if lactose intolerant, limiting excess fat, reducing carbohydrates and reducing high-fiber foods during flares. Mixed advice exists regarding probiotics. Enteral nutrition is recommended for Crohn's disease patients in Japan, which differs from practices in the USA.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will be discussed.},

   abstract = {First defined in the mid-1990s, prebiotics, which alter the composition and activity of gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota to improve health and well-being, have generated scientific and consumer interest and regulatory debate. The Life Sciences Research Organization, Inc. (LSRO) held a workshop, Prebiotics and the Health Benefits of Fiber: Future Research and Goals, in February 2011 to assess the current state of the science and the international regulatory environment for prebiotics, identify research gaps, and create a strategy for future research. A developing body of evidence supports a role for prebiotics in reducing the risk and severity of GI infection and inflammation, including diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, and ulcerative colitis as well as bowel function disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics also increase the bioavailability and uptake of minerals and data suggest that they reduce the risk of obesity by promoting satiety and weight loss. Additional research is needed to define the relationship between the consumption of different prebiotics and improvement of human health. New information derived from the characterization of the composition and function of different prebiotics as well as the interactions among and between gut microbiota and the human host would improve our understanding of the effects of prebiotics on health and disease and could assist in surmounting regulatory issues related to prebiotic use.},

   abstract = {The human intestinal cell line Caco-2 is a well-established model system to study cellular differentiation of human enterocytes of intestinal origin, because these cells have the capability to differentiate spontaneously into polarized cells with morphological and biochemical features of small intestinal enterocytes. Therefore, the cells are widely used as an in vitro model for the human intestinal barrier. In this study, a proteomic approach was used to identify the molecular marker of intestinal cellular differentiation. The proteome of proliferating Caco-2 cells was compared with that of fully differentiated cells. Two-dimensional gel analysis yielded 53 proteins that were differently regulated during the differentiation process. Pathway analysis conducted with those 34 proteins that were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis revealed subsets of proteins with common molecular and cellular function. It was shown that proteins involved in xenobiotic and drug metabolism as well as in lipid metabolism were upregulated upon cellular differentiation. In parallel, proteins associated with proliferation, cell growth and cancer were downregulated, reflecting the loss of the tumorigenic phenotype of the cells. Thus, the proteomic approach in combination with a literature-based pathway analysis yielded valuable information about the differentiation process of Caco-2 cells on the molecular level that contributes to the understanding of the development of colon cancer or inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis--diseases associated with an imbalanced differentiation process of intestinal cells.},

   abstract = {Besides their possible effects on the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), some environmental factors can modulate the clinical course of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). This review is mainly devoted to describing the current knowledge of the impact of some of these factors on the outcome of IBD, with special emphasis on smoking and diet. Although the impact of smoking on the susceptibility to develop CD and UC is firmly established, its influence on the clinical course of both diseases is still debatable. In CD, active smoking is a risk factor for postoperative recurrence. Beyond this clinical setting, smoking cessation seems to be advantageous in those CD patients who were smokers at disease diagnosis, while smoking resumption may be of benefit in ex-smokers with resistant UC. The role of dietary habits on the development of IBD is far from being well established. Also, food intolerances are very frequent, but usually inconsistent among IBD patients, and therefore no general dietary recommendations can be made in these patients. In general, IBD patients should eat a diet as varied as possible. Regarding the possible therapeutic role of some dietary components in IBD, lessons should be drawn from the investigation of the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in CD. Low-fat diets seem to be particularly useful. Also, some lipid sources, such as olive oil, medium-chain triglycerides, and perhaps omega-3 fatty acids, might have a therapeutic effect. Fermentable fiber may have a role in preventing relapses in inactive UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIM: Despite their well known anti-inflammatory actions, the clinical usefulness of omega-3 PUFA in inflammatory bowel disease is controversial. We aimed to systematically review the available data on the performance of omega-3 PUFA as therapeutic agents in these patients. METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched for RCT of fish oil or omega-3 PUFA therapy in both active and inactive ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, without limitation on either the length of therapy or the form it was given, including nutritional supplements and enteral formula diets. Eligible articles were assessed for methodological quality on the basis of the adequacy of the randomisation process, concealment of allocation, blinding of intervention and outcome, possible biases, and completeness of follow-up. The five-point Oxford quality score was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 19 RCT were finally selected for this review. Overall, available data do not allow to support the use of omega-3 PUFA supplementation for the treatment of both active and inactive inflammatory bowel disease. Negative results are quite consistent in trials assessing the use of omega-3 PUFA to maintain disease remission, particularly ulcerative colitis, and to a lesser extent Crohn's disease. Trials on their use in active disease do not allow to draw firm conclusions mainly because the heterogeneity of design (ulcerative colitis) or their short number (Crohn's disease). In most trials, the appropriateness of the selected placebo is questionable. CONCLUSION: The present systematic review does not allow to make firm recommendations about the usefulness of omega-3 PUFA in inflammatory bowel disease.},

Despite widespread use of these natural therapies by patients, health care providers may be unfamiliar with probiotics as a treatment modality. This review describes the rationale for use of probiotics in IBD, the history behind current research directions, and recent controlled clinical studies in which efficacy of probiotics has been explored in patients with IBD. Emphasis is placed upon critical analysis of study designs for investigations that used lactic acid-producing bacteria or Saccharomyces boulardii in management of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. While there is suggestion of benefit when patients with ulcerative colitis use bacterial therapies and when patients with Crohn's disease use S boulardii, small sample sizes and methodological flaws in study designs necessitate that additional investigations be conducted before probiotics can be routinely recommended in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Intestinal epithelial cell damage is frequently seen in the mucosal lesions of inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Complete remission of these diseases requires both the cessation of inflammation and the migration of enterocytes to repair the damaged epithelium. Lyophilized Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb, Biocodex) is a nonpathogenic yeast widely used as a therapeutic agent for the treatment and prevention of diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disorders. In this study, we determined whether Sb could accelerate enterocyte migration. Cell migration was determined in Sb force-fed C57BL6J mice and in an in vitro wound model. The impact on alpha2beta1 integrin activity was assessed using adhesion assays and the analysis of alpha2beta1 mediated signaling pathways both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that Sb secretes compounds that enhance the migration of enterocytes independently of cell proliferation. This enhanced migration was associated with the ability of Sb to favor cell-extracellular matrix interaction. Indeed, the yeast activates alpha2beta1 integrin collagen receptors. This leads to an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic molecules, including focal adhesion kinase and paxillin, involved in the integrin signaling pathway. These changes are associated with the reorganization of focal adhesion structures. In conclusion Sb secretes motogenic factors that enhance cell restitution through the dynamic regulation of alpha2beta1 integrin activity. This could be of major importance in the development of novel therapies targeting diseases characterized by severe mucosal injury, such as inflammatory and infectious bowel diseases.},

This plant is the main botanical source of Brazilian green propolis, a natural product incorporated into food and beverages to improve health. The present study aimed to investigate the chemical profile and intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of B. dracunculifolia extract on experimental ulcerative colitis induced by trinitrobenzenosulfonic acid (TNBS). Colonic damage was evaluated macroscopically and biochemically through its evaluation of glutathione content and its myeloperoxidase (MPO) and alkaline phosphatase activities. Additional in vitro experiments were performed in order to test the antioxidant activity by inhibition of induced lipid peroxidation in the rat brain membrane. Phytochemical analysis was performed by HPLC using authentic standards. The administration of plant extract (5 and 50 mg kg(-1)) significantly attenuated the colonic damage induced by TNBS as evidenced both macroscopically and biochemically. This beneficial effect can be associated with an improvement in the colonic oxidative status, since plant extract prevented glutathione depletion, inhibited lipid peroxidation and reduced MPO activity. Caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, aromadendrin-4-O-methyl ether, 3-prenyl-p-coumaric acid, 3,5-diprenyl-p-coumaric acid and baccharin were detected in the plant extract.},

The aim of the present work was to determine whether the anti-inflammatory effects reported for yoghurt in acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced intestinal inflammation in mice also could prevent or attenuate the recurrent intestinal inflammation, thus maintaining remission. The innate response also was evaluated through participation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the analysis of T-cell populations to determine the effects of yoghurt in an acute inflammatory bowel disease model. Yoghurt exerted a beneficial effect on acute intestinal inflammation by regulating T-cell expansion and modulating the expression of TLRs, with decrease of TLR4(+) and increase of TLR9(+) cells. The anti-inflammatory effect of yoghurt also was demonstrated in a recurrent inflammation model. Yoghurt administration during the remission phase prevented the recurrence of inflammation without producing undesirable side effects. The yoghurt effect may be mediated by increased interleukin 10 production and changes in intestinal microbiota.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Grape seed extract (GSE) constitutes a rich source of procyanidins. GSE has been demonstrated to exert encouraging anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer properties in experimental settings, although its effects on inflammation of the colon remain undefined. AIM: To determine the effects of GSE in a rat model of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) for ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged daily (days 0-10) with GSE (400 mg/kg). Ulcerative colitis was induced by substituting DSS (2 % w/v) for drinking water from days 5-10. A sucrose breath test was performed on day 11 to determine small bowel function and intestinal tissues were collected for histological analyses. Statistical analysis was by one-way or repeated-measures ANOVA and p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Compared to DSS-treated controls, GSE significantly decreased ileal villus height (14 %; p < 0.01) and mucosal thickness (13 %; p < 0.01) towards the values of normal controls. GSE reduced qualitative histological severity score (p < 0.05) in the proximal colon, although no significant effect was evident in the distal colon. However, GSE failed to prevent DSS-induced damage to the crypts of both colonic regions. Administration of GSE did not negatively impact metabolic parameters, nor did it induce any deleterious gastrointestinal side effects in healthy animals. CONCLUSIONS: GSE decreased the severity of selected markers of DSS-induced colitis in the distal ileum and proximal colon, suggesting the potential as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Future studies of GSE should investigate alternative delivery methods and treatment regimens, further seeking to identify the individual bioactive factors.},

Moreover, the integrity of the in vitro epithelial monolayer under the CGN insult was maintained by both activated pro-inflammatory transcription factors NF-kappaB and EGR-1. Suppression of NF-kappaB or EGR-1 aggravated barrier disruption by CGN, which was associated with the reduced gene expression of tight junction component zonula occludens 1 and its irregular localization in the epithelial monolayer.},

   abstract = {In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), it is known that besides genetic and environmental factors (e.g. diet, drugs, stress), the microbiota play an important role in the pathogenesis. Patients with IBD have an altered microbiota (dysbiosis) and therefore, probiotics, defined as 'live micro-organisms that when administered in adequate amounts can confer a health benefit on the host', have been suggested as nutritional supplements to restore these imbalances. The best response on probiotics among the different types of IBD appears to be in the case of ulcerative colitis. Although probiotics show promise in IBD in both clinical and animal studies, further mechanistic studies are necessary to optimize the use of probiotics as supporting therapy in IBD. Murine models of experimental colitis have been used for decades to study this pathology, and these models have been proven useful to search for new therapeutic approaches. The purpose of this review is to summarize probiotic-host interaction studies in murine models of experimental colitis and to evaluate how these models can further help in understanding these complex interactions. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms behind the beneficial effects will assist in better and possibly more efficient probiotic formulations.},

   abstract = {The research reported herein was designed to assess whether the bacterium, Dietzia subspecies C79793-74, used as a probiotic, could prevent development of parameters indicative of bovine paratuberculosis after potential in utero, birthing and neonatal (colostrum) exposure to Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). Such exposure avenues are especially relevant for dairy farms practicing good management procedures since calves on these farms could be infected via dams that have yet to be identified as MAP-positive. Indeed, of 18 calves in the present study that became paratuberculosis parameter-positive, five had dams that were negative for all parameters pre-calving. Parameters used herein to define paratuberculosis status were serum ELISA, serum agar gel immunodiffusion, cultureable fecal MAP, histopathology at necropsy and clinical disease. Thirty-four newborn calves, whose dams were paratuberculosis-positive, were assigned to four different treatment groups. Ten were treated daily for 60 days with viable Dietzia added to their antibiotic-free milk feedings; none became positive for any parameter with age. In contrast, seven of eight calves that were not treated became positive for one or more paratuberculosis-associated parameter. Sixteen calves were treated with viable Dietzia for the first two days of life; eight were then not treated further, whereas the other eight were treated an additional 58 days with Dietzia added to tetracycline-fortified milk (Dietzia is sensitive to tetracycline). In these two groups, positivity developed in five of eight and six of eight, respectively. These results indicated that (a) a daily, 60-day treatment with viable Dietzia effectively prevented development of parameters indicative of paratuberculosis and (b) this treatment, in combination with good management practices, has the potential to eradicate MAP from animals/herds, which should curtail the spread of MAP. Such results should significantly reduce human exposure to MAP, which in turn, could have relevance for the controversial role of MAP in Crohn's disease, type-1 diabetes mellitus, sarcoidosis, Blau syndrome, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and multiple sclerosis.},

   abstract = {A naturally occurring gastrointestinal disease, primarily of ruminants (Johne disease), is a chronic debilitating disease that is caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). MAP infection occurs primarily in utero and in newborns. Outside our Dietzia probiotic treatment, there are no preventive/curative therapies for bovine paratuberculosis. Interestingly, MAP is at the center of controversy as to its role in (cause of) Crohn disease (CD) and more recently, its role in diabetes, ulcerative colitis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); the latter two, like CD, are considered to be a result of chronic intestinal inflammation. Treatments, both conventional and biologic agents, which induce and maintain remission are directed at curtailing processes that are an intricate part of inflammation. Most possess side effects of varying severity, lose therapeutic value, and more importantly, none routinely result in prevention and/or cures. Based on (a) similarities of Johne disease and Crohn disease, (b) a report that Dietzia inhibited growth of MAP under specific culture conditions, and (c) findings that Dietzia when used as a probiotic, (i) was therapeutic for adult bovine paratuberculosis, and (ii) prevented development of disease in MAP-infected calves, the goal of the present investigations was to design protocols that have applicability for IBD patients. Dietzia was found safe for cattle of all ages and for normal and immunodeficient mice. The results strongly warrant clinical evaluation as a probiotic, in combination with/without dexamethasone.},

Conventional therapy and more recently biologic agents, all with varying degrees of drawbacks, have resulted in improved control of these diseases. However, as the incidence and prevalence continue to rise, needs for prevention, permanent remission and cures remain unmet, plus there still remain needs for improved control of symptoms, such as pain and diarrhea.

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), results in substantial morbidity and is difficult to treat. New strategies for adjunct therapies are needed. One candidate is the semi-essential amino acid, L-arginine (L-Arg), a complementary medicine purported to be an enhancer of immunity and vitality in the lay media. Using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) as a murine colonic injury and repair model with similarities to human UC, we assessed the effect of L-Arg, as DSS induced increases in colonic expression of the y(+) cationic amino acid transporter 2 (CAT2) and L-Arg uptake. L-Arg supplementation improved the clinical parameters of survival, body weight loss, and colon weight, and reduced colonic permeability and the number of myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils in DSS colitis. Luminex-based multi-analyte profiling demonstrated that there was a marked reduction in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression with L-Arg treatment. Genomic analysis by microarray demonstrated that DSS-treated mice supplemented with L-Arg clustered more closely with mice not exposed to DSS than to those receiving DSS alone, and revealed that multiple genes that were upregulated or downregulated with DSS alone exhibited normalization of expression with L-Arg supplementation. Additionally, L-Arg treatment of mice with DSS colitis resulted in increased ex vivo migration of colonic epithelial cells, suggestive of increased capacity for wound repair. Because CAT2 induction was sustained during L-Arg treatment and inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) requires uptake of L-Arg for generation of NO, we tested the effect of L-Arg in iNOS(-/-) mice and found that its benefits in DSS colitis were eliminated. These preclinical studies indicate that L-Arg supplementation could be a potential therapy for IBD, and that one mechanism of action may be functional enhancement of iNOS activity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Probiotics are increasingly advocated in the management of various gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the current attitudes and prescribing practices of surgeons and gastroenterologists for probiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: A questionnaire was designed to look at the frequency of probiotic prescribing, types of probiotics used, indications for and duration of treatment and clinicians' experiences with probiotic use. A total of 220 questionnaires were mailed to consultant gastroenterologists and surgeons practicing in the UK. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 80.5%, of which 69.5% of respondents said they recommended or prescribed probiotic food supplements to their patients, including 53.4% of surgeons and 80.8% of gastroenterologists (P = 0.00013). The most popular probiotic supplements among surgeons were probiotic-containing yoghurt and drinks (79.5% and 71.8%, respectively), whereas VSL#3 was more popular with gastroenterologists (83.3%). The most popular indications were irritable bowel syndrome (70.7% of prescribers) and pouchitis (67.5% of prescribers). Many respondents prescribed long-term probiotics. Most consultants had been prescribing probiotics for a period of 1 to 5 years. CONCLUSION: Probiotics are popular among gastroenterologists and surgeons in the UK for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Further evidence to support their routine use, by way of large, well-designed randomized controlled trials, is necessary.},

   abstract = {VSL#3 probiotics can be effective on induction and maintenance of the remission of clinical ulcerative colitis. However, the mechanisms are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of VSL#3 probiotics on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in rats. Acute colitis was induced by administration of DSS 3.5 % for 7 days in rats. Rats in two groups were treated with either 15 mg VSL#3 or placebo via gastric tube once daily after induction of colitis; rats in other two groups were treated with either the wortmannin (1 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection or the wortmannin + VSL#3 after induction of colitis. Anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Expression of inflammatory related mediators (iNOS, COX-2, NF-kappaB, Akt, and p-Akt) and cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10) in colonic tissue were assessed. TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10 serum levels were also measured. Our results demonstrated that VSL#3 and wortmannin have anti-inflammatory properties by the reduced disease activity index and MPO activity. In addition, administration of VSL#3 and wortmannin for 7 days resulted in a decrease of iNOS, COX-2, NF-kappaB, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and p-Akt and an increase of IL-10 expression in colonic tissue. At the same time, administration of VSL#3 and wortmannin resulted in a decrease of TNF-alpha and IL-6 and an increase of IL-10 serum levels. VSL#3 probiotics therapy exerts the anti-inflammatory activity in rat model of DSS-induced colitis by inhibiting PI3K/Akt and NF-kappaB pathway.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Activated eosinophils can infiltrate the intestinal mucosa in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and eosinophils are also implicated in the histological damage seen in allergic diseases. AIM: To assess, in a group of patients with IBD in remission or with a mild disease activity, whether serological markers of eosinophil activation, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophil protein X (EPX), are related to evidence of IgE hypersensitivity and to the eosinophilia in gut mucosa. METHODS: Sixty-one patients with IBD (21 Crohn's disease and 40 ulcerative colitis) in remission or with a mild disease activity were screened for IgE hypersensitivity and serological levels of ECP and EPX. Colonic biopsies were taken to assess mucosal eosinophilic infiltration. RESULTS: Skin prick test were positive in 31.1% of the patients with IBD, showing skin reactions to food allergens in 17.7%. Skin prick test findings were unrelated to ECP or EPX levels, or to clinical activity or eosinophil counts in the gut mucosa. A significant correlation was found between ECP and EPX levels (r=0.77; P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Serological ECP and EPX findings did not correlate with IgE hypersensitivity findings or eosinophilic colonic infiltration in patients with IBD in remission or with mild disease activity. The role of eosinophils in IBD needs to be better characterized in the colonic mucosa, instead of relying on serological tests.},

Understanding the microbiota's role in the pathogenesis of the disease could lead to new IBD treatments aimed at shifting the bacteria in the gut back to eubiosis. Probiotics have some efficacy in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), but our current repertoire is limited in potency. Fecal microbiota therapy (FMT) is an emerging treatment for several gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders. It has demonstrated efficacy in treating refractory Clostridium difficile infection, and there are case reports of FMT successfully treating UC. Further clinical studies are justified, and could be complemented by mouse models of fecal transplantation, in which variables can be controlled and manipulated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Defective detoxification of sulfides leads to damage to the mucosa and may play a role in the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). The colonic mucosal thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST) enzyme removes H(2) S by conversion to the less toxic thiocyanate. In this study we measured colonic mucosal TST enzyme activity and gene expression in UC and controls. In addition, the influence of sulfides on butyrate oxidation was evaluated. METHODS: Colonic mucosal biopsies were collected from 92 UC patients and 24 controls. TST activity was measured spectrophotometrically. To assess gene expression, total RNA from biopsies was used for quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In 20 UC patients, gene expression was reassessed after their first treatment with infliximab. To evaluate the effect of sulfides on butyrate oxidation, biopsies were incubated with 1.5 mM NaHS. RESULTS: TST enzyme activity and gene expression were significantly decreased in UC patients vs. controls (P < 0.001). UC patients, classified into disease activity subgroups, showed a significantly decreased TST activity and gene expression in the subgroups as compared to healthy subjects (P < 0.05 for all). In 20 patients, gene expression was reassessed after their first infliximab therapy. In responders to infliximab, a significant increase in TST gene expression was observed. However, TST mRNA levels did not return to control values after therapy in the responders. In controls, but not in UC, sulfide significantly decreased butyrate oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: We found an impaired detoxification mechanism of sulfide at TST protein and RNA level in UC. Inflammation was clearly associated with the observed TST deficiency.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In ulcerative colitis (UC) butyrate metabolism is impaired due to a defect in the butyrate oxidation pathway and/or transport. In the present study we correlated butyrate uptake and oxidation to the gene expression of the butyrate transporter SLC16A1 and the enzymes involved in butyrate oxidation (ACSM3, ACADS, ECHS1, HSD17B10, and ACAT2) in UC and controls. METHODS: Colonic mucosal biopsies were collected during endoscopy of 88 UC patients and 20 controls with normal colonoscopy. Butyrate uptake and oxidation was measured by incubating biopsies with (14) C-labeled Na-butyrate. To assess gene expression, total RNA from biopsies was used for quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In 20 UC patients, gene expression was reassessed after treatment with infliximab. RESULTS: Butyrate uptake and oxidation were significantly decreased in UC versus controls (P < 0.001 for both). Butyrate oxidation remained significantly reduced in UC after correction for butyrate uptake (P < 0.001), suggesting that the butyrate oxidation pathway itself is also affected. Also, the mucosal gene expression of SLC16A1, ACSM3, ACADS, ECHS1, HSD17B10, and ACAT2 was significantly decreased in UC as compared with controls (P < 0.001 for all). In a subgroup of patients (n = 20), the gene expression was reassessed after infliximab therapy. In responders to therapy, a significant increase in gene expression was observed. Nevertheless, only ACSM3 mRNA levels returned to control values after therapy in the responders groups. CONCLUSIONS: The deficiency in the colonic butyrate metabolism in UC is initiated at the gene expression level and is the result of a decreased expression of SLC16A1 and enzymes in the beta-oxidation pathway of butyrate.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors is unclear, whether related to concomitant thiopurines usage or due to the underlying inflammatory disease. We sought to review all cases of T-cell NHL reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in patients receiving TNF-alpha inhibitors for all approved indications and examine the risk of T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors in comparison with the use of thiopurines in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) was queried for all lymphomas following treatment with the following TNF-alpha inhibitors: infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, and their trade names. Full reports for T-cell NHL cases were identified using the Freedom of Information Act. In addition, T-cell NHL reported in patients IBD with the use of the thiopurines-azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and their trade names were also collected. A search of MEDLINE was performed for additional T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors or thiopurines, not reported to the FDA but available in published literature. The histological subtypes of T-cell NHL reported with TNF-alpha inhibitors were compared with reported subtypes in Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) -17 registry. Reported risk of T-cell NHL in IBD with TNF-alpha inhibitors, thiopurines, or concomitant use was calculated using Fisher's exact test using 5-aminosalicylates as control drugs. RESULTS: A total of 3,130,267 reports were downloaded from the FDA AERS (2003-2010). Ninety-one cases of T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors were identified in the FDA AERS and nine additional cases were identified on MEDLINE search. A total of 38 patients had rheumatoid arthritis, 36 cases had Crohn's disease, 11 had psoriasis, 9 had ulcerative colitis, and 6 had ankylosing spondylitis. Sixty-eight of the cases (68%) involved exposure to both a TNF-alpha inhibitor and an immunomodulator (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, leflunomide, or cyclosporine). Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) was the most common reported subtype, whereas mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome and HSTCL were identified as more common with TNF-alpha-inhibitor exposure compared with SEER-17 registry. Nineteen cases of T-cell NHL with thiopurines were identified in the FDA AERS and one additional case on MEDLINE. Reported risk of T-cell NHL was higher with TNF-alpha inhibitor use in combination with thiopurines (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.98-354.09; P<0.0001) and thiopurines alone (95% CI 8.32-945.38; P<0.0001) but not with TNF-alpha inhibitor use alone (95% CI 0.13-10.61; P=1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Risk of T-cell NHL is increased with TNF-alpha inhibitor use in combination with thiopurines but not with TNF-alpha inhibitors alone.},

This group includes approximately 80 disorders, some of which can at times be associated in a single patient. In psoriasis, Crohn's disease may be observed slightly more frequently, but ulcerative colitis and celiac disease are also an issue. The underlying relations between these disorders comprise: i) genetic data obtained by genome-wide association studies that show the involvement of shared predisposing loci and/or genes, for example, in innate immunity; ii) immunological data: these disorders share inflammation effector mechanisms, particularly the activation pathway of Th17 lymphocytes, which explains the efficacy of anti-TNF antibodies and anti-IL-12/23; and iii) environmental co-factors such as smoking, possibly certain food proteins (gliadin, etc.), and bacterial infections that are probably decisive elements in the genesis of these diseases.},

Most studies are limited by design or do not show that probiotic treatment is effective. Only a few randomised controlled trials have demonstrated any beneficial effect of probiotic use in IBD; namely, the use of VSL#3 in patients with pouchitis and ulcerative colitis. So far, the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of Crohn's disease has not been clearly demonstrated. Furthermore, issues pertaining to their mechanisms of action, dosages and dosing intervals, safety, and health insurance coverage are currently unresolved. Given the limited body of evidence of their efficacy from controlled trials and the many unanswered questions on probiotic treatment, we recommend following the evidence obtained from well-designed randomised controlled trials and only prescribing probiotic treatment (e.g. VSL #3) for the prevention of pouchitis and the treatment of patients with mildly active ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An imbalance in gut microbiota seems to contribute to the development of chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as ulcerative colitis (UC). Although it has been suggested that probiotic supplementation is an effective approach to colitis, its effects on intestinal flora and on mucosal cytokine balance have never been explored. AIM: To evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) DG, a probiotic strain, on colonic-associated microbiota, mucosal cytokine balance, and toll-like receptor (TLR) expression. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with mild left-sided UC were randomly allocated to one of three groups for an 8-week treatment period: the first group of 7 patients received oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) alone, the second group of 8 patients received oral 5-ASA plus oral L. casei DG, and the third group of 11 patients received oral 5-ASA and rectal L. casei DG. Biopsies were collected from the sigmoid region to culture mucosal-associated microbes and to assess cytokine and TLR messenger RNA (mRNA) levels by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: 5-ASA alone or together with oral L. casei DG failed to affect colonic flora and TLR expression in a significant manner, but when coupled with rectally administered L. casei DG, it modified colonic microbiota by increasing Lactobacillus spp. and reducing Enterobacteriaceae. It also significantly reduced TLR-4 and interleukin (IL)-1beta mRNA levels and significantly increased mucosal IL-10. CONCLUSIONS: Manipulation of mucosal microbiota by L. casei DG and its effects on the mucosal immune system seem to be required to mediate the beneficial activities of probiotics in UC patients.},

METHODS: Real time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) assays were used to enumerate DSV in gastrointestinal tract of 58 subjects. Diversity of gut microbiota was analyzed by PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and 16S rRNA V3 sequencing. RESULTS: RT-PCR detected DSV in all samples. Significantly increased numbers of DSV were observed for UC and PP groups compared with CRC and H groups. No significant difference was observed for CRC and H groups with gene copy numbers of DSV. Alterations of DSV and gut microbiota were observed in disease groups. CONCLUSION: We found that quantity and diversity of DSV are significantly increased in UC and PP compared to controls. The increased numbers of DSV in disease groups suggests a possible harmful role.},

   abstract = {Autism is a heterogeneous group of life-long neurologic problems that begin in childhood. Success in efforts to understand and treat autism has been mostly elusive. The role of autoimmunity in autism has gained recognition both for associated systemic autoimmune disease and the presence of brain autoantibodies in autistic children and their family members. There is an acknowledged genetic susceptibility to autism--most notably allotypes of complement C4. C4 defects are associated with several autoimmune diseases and also confer susceptibility to mycobacterial infections. Mycobacterium avium ss. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes an enteric inflammatory disease in ruminant animals (Johne's disease) and is the putative cause of the very similar Crohn's disease in humans. Humans are widely exposed to MAP in food and water. MAP has been also linked to ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, sarcoidosis, Blau syndrome, autoimmune (Type 1) diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and multiple sclerosis. Environmental agents are thought to trigger autism in the genetically at risk. Molecular mimicry is the proposed mechanism by which MAP is thought to trigger autoantibodies. Autoantibodies to brain myelin basic protein (MBP) is a common feature of autism. This article considers the subset of autoimmunity-related autism patients and postulates that MAP, through molecular mimicry to its heat shock protein HSP65, triggers autism by stimulating antibodies that cross react with myelin basic protein (MBP).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Many species within the phylum Firmicutes are thought to exert anti-inflammatory effects. We quantified bacteria belonging to the genus Butyricicoccus in stools of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). We evaluated the effect of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum in a rat colitis model and analysed the ability to prevent cytokine-induced increases in epithelial permeability. DESIGN: A genus-specific quantitative PCR was used for quantification of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC or CD and healthy subjects. The effect of B pullicaecorum on trinitrobenzenesulfonic (TNBS)-induced colitis was assessed and the effect of B pullicaecorum culture supernatant on epithelial barrier function was investigated in vitro. RESULTS: The average number of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC and CD in active (UC: 8.61 log10/g stool; CD: 6.58 log10/g stool) and remission phase (UC: 8.69 log10/g stool; CD: 8.38 log10/g stool) was significantly lower compared with healthy subjects (9.32 log10/g stool) and correlated with disease activity in CD. Oral administration of B pullicaecorum resulted in a significant protective effect based on macroscopic and histological criteria and decreased intestinal myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-12 levels. Supernatant of B pullicaecorum prevented the loss of transepithelial resistance (TER) and the increase in IL-8 secretion induced by TNFalpha and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in a Caco-2 cell model. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have lower numbers of Butyricicoccus bacteria in their stools. Administration of B pullicaecorum attenuates TNBS-induced colitis in rats and supernatant of B pullicaecorum cultures strengthens the epithelial barrier function by increasing the TER.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), which includes both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is caused by a complex interplay involving genetic predisposition, environmental factors and an infectious agent. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is a promising pathogen candidate since it produces a chronic intestinal inflammatory disease in ruminants that resembles CD in humans. MAP is a ubiquitous microorganism, although its presence in the food chain, especially in milk from infected animals, is what made us think that there could be an association between lactase persistence (LP) and IBD. The LCT mutation has brought adaptation to dairy farming which in turn would have increased exposure of the population to infection by MAP. NOD2 gene mutations are highly associated to CD. METHODS: In our study, CD and UC patients and controls from the North of Spain were genotyped for the lactase gene (LCT) and for three NOD-2 variants, R702W, G908R and Cins1007fs. MAP PCR was carried out in order to assess MAP infection status and these results were correlated with LCT and NOD2 genotypes. RESULTS: As for LP, no association was found with IBD, although UC patients were less likely to present the T/T-13910 variant compared to controls, showing a higher C-allele frequency and a tendency to lactase non-persistence (LNP). NOD2 mutations were associated to CD being the per-allele risk higher for the Cins1007fs variant. MAP infection was more extended among the healthy controls (45.2%) compared to CD patients (21.38%) and UC patients (19.04%) and this was attributed to therapy. The Asturian CD cohort presented higher levels of MAP prevalence (38.6%) compared to the Basque CD cohort (15.5%), differences also attributed to therapy. No interaction was found between MAP infection and LCT or NOD2 status. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that LP is not significantly associated with IBD, but that MAP infection and NOD2 do show not mutually interacting associations with IBD.},

Similarly, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are also prevalent in these regions. Evidence exists to support that factors, such as lack of zinc (it is common in patients with IBD, in particular Crohn's patients) may significantly affect the activity of some enzymes, such as, disaccharidases and other digesting enzymes of carbohydrates and that would lead to the recruitment of incompletely digested carbohydrates to the terminal ileum and continual stimulation of the immune-response accordingly. This concept may explain the observation of the existence of higher significant percentage of severe disease in Caucasian patients with IBD comparable with the respected Asian patients who consume less.},

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of administration of GBF on serum TNF-alpha, IL-6 and -8 levels in UC patients in remission. METHODS: Forty-one patients with UC were divided into two groups, namely control and GBF group. Twenty-one patients in the control group received standard treatment while 20 patients in the GBF group received 30 g of GBF daily by oral administration during two months of the study along with standard drug therapy. RESULTS: Levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and -8 all decreased in the GBF group compared with baseline during the two-month study, while in the control group all values rose. For IL-6 and -8 this effect was significant, P = 0.034 and 0.013, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study showed that the consumption of GBF may reduce the level of serum TNF-alpha, IL-6 and -8 in patients with UC. This investigation was designed as a pilot study and the results may provide a basis for more future clinical trials.},

   abstract = {Innate immunity prevents pathogens from entering and spreading within the body. This function is especially important in the gastrointestinal tract and skin, as these organs have a large surface contact area with the outside environment. In the intestine, luminal commensal bacteria are necessary for adequate food digestion and play a crucial role in tolerance to benign antigens. Immune system damage can create an intestinal inflammatory response, leading to chronic disease including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an IBD of unknown etiology with increasing worldwide prevalence. In the intestinal mucosa of UC patients, there is an imbalance in the IL-33/ST2 axis, an important modulator of the innate immune response. This paper reviews the role of the IL-33/ST2 system in innate immunity of the intestinal mucosa and its importance in inflammatory bowel diseases, especially ulcerative colitis.},

Intra-colonic AA administration increased colonic mucosal damage and inflammation, mucus/bloody diarrhoea, stool frequency, but decreased body weight which were reversed by TCE and sulfasalazine (SS, positive control) treatments. TCE showed antibacterial activity and both TCE and SS enhanced the antioxidants, but decreased free radicals and myeloperoxidase activities affected in acetic acid-induced colitis. TCE indicated the presence of active principles with proven antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and free radical scavenging and healing properties.

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory conditions, which are increasing in incidence, prevalence, and severity, in many countries. While there is genetic susceptibility to IBD, the probability of disease development is modified by diet, lifestyle, and endogenous factors, including the gut microbiota. For example, high intakes of mono- and disaccharides, and total fats consistently increases the risk developing both forms of IBD. High vegetable intake reduces the risk of UC, whereas increased fruit and/or dietary fiber intake appears protective against CD. Low levels of certain micronutrients, especially vitamin D, may increase the risk of both diseases. Dietary patterns may be even more important to disease susceptibility than the levels of individual foods or nutrients. Various dietary regimes may modify disease symptoms, in part through their actions on the host microbiota. Both probiotics and prebiotics may modulate the microflora, and reduce the likelihood of IBD regression. However, other dietary factors affect the microbiota in different ways. Distinguishing cause from effect, and characterizing the relative roles of human and microbial genes, diet, age of onset, gender, life style, smoking history, ethnic background, environmental exposures, and medications, will require innovative and internationally integrated approaches.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: The plant Moringa oleifera Lam (Moringaceae), commonly known as the drumstick tree, is an indigenous species in India. This species has been of interest to researchers because traditionally its roots are reported in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). Traditionally it is reported that Citrus sinensis Linn (Rutaceae) fruit rind when combined with M. oleifera will increase the efficacy of the plant in the treatment of UC. OBJECTIVE: The present work was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of M. oleifera root alone and in combination with C. sinensis fruit rind in the treatment of UC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethanol and aqueous extracts of M. oleifera roots (100 and 200 mg/kg, body weight) were screened alone and in equal combination with ethanol extract of C. sinensis fruit rind, i.e., 50 mg/kg each of C. sinensis and M. oleifera for their activity on acetic acid-induced UC in mice. RESULTS: Treatment with combination of extracts of M. oleifera root and C. sinensis fruit rind (50 mg/kg, each) showed less ulceration and hyperemia than individual extract (200 mg/kg) in histopathological observation. Acetic acid increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) level in blood and colon tissue to 342 U/mL and 384 U/mg, respectively. Combination of ethanol extract of M. oleifera root with C. sinensis fruit rind extract significantly (p<0.05) decreased MPO in blood and tissue to 278 U/mL and 291 U/mg, respectively. MPO in blood and tissue in control group was 85 +/- 1.2 U/mL and 96 +/- 1.3 U/mg, respectively. Similarly this combination significantly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) level in blood and tissue to 7.11 nmol/mL and 8.19 nmol/mg, from 11.20 nmol/mL and 13.20 nmol/mg, respectively. MDA in blood and tissue in control group was 2.76 +/- 1.2 nmol/mL and 3.76 +/- 1.2 nmol/mg, respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Results show that a combination of M. oleifera root extracts with C. sinensis fruit rind extract is effective in the treatment of UC and results are comparable with the standard drug prednisolone.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are more likely to have Crohn's disease (CD) than ulcerative colitis (UC) and their disease tends to be more extensive and severe than in adults. We hypothesized that the prevalence of anemia would therefore be greater in children and adolescents than in adults attending IBD outpatient clinics. METHODS: Using the WHO age-adjusted definitions of anemia we assessed the prevalence, severity, type, and response to treatment of anemia in patients attending pediatric, adolescent, and adult IBD clinics at our hospital. RESULTS: The prevalence of anemia was 70% (41/59) in children, 42% (24/54) in adolescents, and 40% (49/124) in adults (P < 0.01). Overall, children (88% [36/41]) and adolescents (83% [20/24]) were more often iron-deficient than adults (55% [27/49]) (P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression showed that both active disease (odds ratio [OR], 4.7 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5, 8.8) and attending the pediatric clinic (OR 3.7; 95% CI, 1.6, 8.4) but not the adolescent clinic predicted iron deficiency anemia. Fewer iron-deficient children (13% [5/36]) than adolescents (30% [6/20]) or adults (48% [13/27]) had been given oral iron (P < 0.05); none had received intravenous iron compared with 30% (6/20) adolescents and 41% (11/27) adults (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is even more common in children than in older IBD patients. Oral iron was given to half of adolescents and adults but, despite similar tolerance and efficacy, only a quarter of children with iron-deficient anemia. Reasons for the apparent underutilization of iron therapy include a perceived lack of benefit and concerns about side effects, including worsening of IBD activity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of krill oil (KO) on inflammation and redox status in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: Control, DSS, and DSS + KO 5% in a 4-week diet study. Colitis was induced by 5% DSS in the drinking water the last week of the experiment. Weight and disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histological combined score (HCS), colon levels of selected cytokines and prostaglandins, markers of protein oxidative damage, fatty acid profile, and expression of selected genes were measured. RESULTS: Rats in the DSS group increased their DAI and HCS compared with healthy controls. The colon length was significantly preserved after KO diet. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta were elevated in the DSS group compared with controls. Cytokines and HCS were nonsignificantly lower in the KO versus the DSS group. Prostaglandin (PG)E(3) increased significantly in the KO versus the other groups. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma expression was nonsignificantly increased while PPAR-gamma coactivator 1alpha (Pparg1alpha) expression increased significantly after KO. The levels of protein oxidation markers decreased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: KO showed protective potential against DSS colitis based on the preservation of colon length, reduction of oxidative markers and the consistent beneficial changes of HCS, cytokine, and (PG)E(3) levels, as well as PPAR-gamma and Pparg1alpha expression compared with DSS alone. These findings indicate an anti-inflammatory and a protein antioxidant effect of KO.},

   abstract = {The role of the gut microbiome in human health and disease with a particular emphasis on therapeutic use of probiotics under specific medical conditions was mainly highlighted in 1st Annual conference of Probiotic Association of India (PAi) and International Symposium on "Probiotics for Human Health - New Innovations and Emerging Trends" held on 27th-28th August, 2012 at New Delhi, India. There is increasing recognition of the fact that dysbiosis or alteration of this gut microbiome may be implicated in gastro-intestinal disorders including diarrheal diseases, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, life style diseases viz. Diabetes Mellitus-2 and obesity etc. This report summarizes the proceedings of the conference and the symposium comprehensively. Although, research on probiotics has been continuing for the past few decades, the subject has been currently the major focus of attention across the world due to recent advances and new developments in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and emergence of new generation of high through put sequencing technologies that have immensely helped in understanding the probiotic functionality and mode of action from nutritional and health perspectives. There is now sufficient evidence backed up with good quality scientific clinical data to suggest that probiotic interventions could indeed be effective in various types of diarrheal diseases, other chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders like pouchitis, necrotizing entero-colitis, allergic responses and lactose intolerance etc. This report makes a modest attempt to give all the stake holders involved in development of probiotic based functional/health foods an overview of the current status of probiotics research at the Global and National level. The most crucial issues that emerged from the lead talks delivered by the eminent speakers from India and abroad were the major focus of discussions in different plenary and technical sessions. By discussing some of these issues from scientific perspectives, the conference could achieve its prime objective of disseminating the current knowledge on the prospects of probiotics as potential biotherapeutics in the management of human health and diseases.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are chronically relapsing, immune-mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. A major challenge in the treatment of IBD is the heterogenous nature of these pathologies. Both, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are of multifactorial etiology and feature a complex interaction of host genetic susceptibility and environmental factors such as diet and gut microbiota. Genome-wide association studies identified disease-relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms in approximately 100 genes, but at the same time twin studies also clearly indicated a strong environmental impact in disease development. However, attempts to link dietary factors to the risk of developing IBD, based on epidemiological observations showed controversial outcomes. Yet, emerging high-throughput technologies implying complete biological systems might allow taking nutrient-gene interactions into account for a better classification of patient subsets in the future. In this context, 2 new scientific fields, "nutrigenetics" and "nutrigenomics" have been established. "Nutrigenetics," studying the effect of genetic variations on nutrient-gene interactions and "Nutrigenomics," describing the impact of nutrition on physiology and health status on the level of gene transcription, protein expression, and metabolism. It is hoped that the integration of both research areas will promote the understanding of the complex gene-environment interaction in IBD etiology and in the long-term will lead to personalized nutrition for disease prevention and treatment. This review briefly summarizes data on the impact of nutrients on intestinal inflammation, highlights nutrient-gene interactions, and addresses the potential of applying "omic" technologies in the context of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to determine therapeutic efficacy of the biological agents for the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, the external validity of findings from RCTs might be compromised by their stringent selection criteria. We investigated the proportion of patients encountered during routine clinical practice who would qualify for enrollment into a pivotal RCT of biological agents for IBD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with moderate-severe IBD who presented to a tertiary referral center. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were extracted from published RCTs of biologics approved by the Food and Drug Administration and applied to the study population. RESULTS: Only 31.1% of 206 patients with IBD (34% with Crohn's disease [CD], 26% with ulcerative colitis) would have been eligible to participate in any of the selected RCTs. Patients would have been excluded because they had stricturing or penetrating CD, took high doses of steroids, had comorbidities or prior exposure to biologics, or received topical therapies. Of the trial-ineligible patients with ulcerative colitis, 23.3% had colectomies, and 31.7% received infliximab, with a 63.2% response rate. Approximately half (49.4%) of the 82 trial-ineligible patients with CD received biological therapies, with lower response rates (60%) than trial-eligible patients (89%; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with moderate-severe IBD evaluated in an outpatient practice would not qualify for enrollment in a pivotal RCT of biological reagents; this finding raises important questions about their therapeutic efficacy beyond the clinical trial populations. Additional evaluation of the transparency of RCT design and selection criteria is needed to determine whether trial results can be generalized to the population.},

   abstract = {With the use of molecular techniques, numerous studies have evaluated the composition of the intestinal microbiota in health and disease. However, it is of major interest to supplement this with a functional analysis of the microbiota. In this review, the different approaches that have been used to characterize microbial metabolites, yielding information on the functional end products of microbial metabolism, have been summarized. To analyze colonic microbial metabolites, the most conventional way is by application of a hypothesis-driven targeted approach, through quantification of selected metabolites from carbohydrate (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) and protein fermentation (e.g., p-cresol, phenol, ammonia, or H(2)S), secondary bile acids, or colonic enzymes. The application of stable isotope-labeled substrates can provide an elegant solution to study these metabolic pathways in vivo. On the other hand, a top-down approach can be followed by applying metabolite fingerprinting techniques based on (1)H-NMR or mass spectrometric analysis. Quantification of known metabolites and characterization of metabolite patterns in urine, breath, plasma, and fecal samples can reveal new pathways and give insight into physiological regulatory processes of the colonic microbiota. In addition, specific metabolic profiles can function as a diagnostic tool for the identification of several gastrointestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, future research will have to evaluate the relevance of associations between metabolites and different disease states.},

   abstract = {Bacteria play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), its complications and its symptoms. Antibiotics can decrease tissue invasion and eliminate aggressive bacterial species. They are used in IBD to treat infective complications and for altering bacterial flora, which may result in specific anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, suppression of bacterial metabolic activities or direct effects of antibiotics on intestinal structures and functions may result in symptoms which cannot be differentiated from symptoms caused by inflammation. Although current clinical trials do not fulfill criteria of evidence-based treatment, a few placebo- or standard treatment-controlled studies suggest that metronidazole and ciprofloxacin are effective in Crohn's colitis and ileocolitis, perianal fistulae and pouchitis. Administration of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics can restore a predominance of beneficial species. However, beneficial effects of probiotics in IBD are modest, strain-specific and limited to certain manifestations of disease and duration of use of the probiotic. For probiotics there is reasonable evidence of efficacy in relapse prevention in chronic pouchitis and ulcerative colitis, and suggestive evidence for postoperative prevention in pouchitis. Therapeutic manipulation of the intestinal flora offers considerable promise for treating IBD, but must be supported by large controlled therapeutic trials before widespread clinical acceptance. These agents may become a component of treating IBD in combination with traditional anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. Probiotic strategies, based on metagenomic or metabonomic analyses, and new classes of probiotics might play an important role in the future management of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of environmental factors in development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains uncertain. The aim of the present study was to assess a number of formerly suggested environmental factors in a case-control study of an unselected and recently diagnosed group of patients with IBD and a control group of orthopaedic patients. METHODS: A total of 123 patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) and 144 with ulcerative colitis (UC) in Copenhagen (2003-2004) were matched 1:1 on age and gender to 267 orthopaedic controls. Participants received a questionnaire with 87 questions concerning environmental factors prior to IBD/orthopaedic admission. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by logistic regression. RESULTS: Being breastfed >6 months (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.23-1.11) and undergoing tonsillectomy (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.31-0.78) decreased the odds for IBD, whereas appendectomy decreased the odds for UC only (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12-0.71). Vaccination against pertussis (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.07-4.03) and polio (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.04-5.43) increased the odds for IBD, whereas measles infection increased the odds for UC (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.15-10.6). Low consumption of fibres and high consumption of sugar were significantly associated with development of CD and UC. Smoking increased the risk for CD and protected against UC. CONCLUSION: Among Danish patients with CD and UC belonging to an unselected cohort, disease occurrence was found to be associated both with well-known factors such as smoking and appendectomy, and with more debated factors including breastfeeding, tonsillectomy, childhood vaccinations, childhood infections, and dietary intake of fibres and sugar.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In normal mucosa, intestinal lamina propria macrophages (IMACs) maintain tolerance against food antigens and the commensal bacterial flora. Several mechanisms have been identified that mediate tolerance. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a large multiprotein complex that degrades cellular proteins. As the UPS may modulate immune functions of IMACs, we performed a detailed investigation of UPS expression and function under normal conditions and in cells derived from patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: IMACs were isolated from intestinal mucosa. mRNA expression of macrophages differentiated in vitro (i.v. MACs) and IMACs was compared by Affymetrix(R) oligonucleotide arrays. Quantitative Taqman-PCR was performed on five exemplary proteasomal and five ubiquitinylation genes each. Proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Proteasome function was assessed by a fluorimetric test. RESULTS: Affymetrix analysis showed downregulation of mRNA expression of almost all represented proteasomal and of 22 ubiquitination-associated genes in IMACs as compared to i.v. MACs and monocytes. By quantitative PCR, up to tenfold higher mRNA expression of 10 exemplary genes of the UPS (UBE2A, UBE2D2, UBE2L6, USP14, UBB and ATPase2, beta2, beta5, beta2i/MECL-1, beta5i/LMP7) was demonstrated in i.v. MACs as compared to IMACs. Immunohistochemistry and Western blots confirmed these findings in intestinal mucosa of controls and patients suffering from diverticulitis. In contrast, a significant increase in protein amounts was found in mucosa of patients with IBD. CONCLUSION: Reduced expression of subunits of the UPS in IMACs of normal mucosa supports the concept of the presence of a nonreactive, anergic macrophage phenotype in the gut under normal conditions. Reinduction in IMACs of IBD mucosa reflects activated IMACs which can present antigenic peptides and thus support inflammation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing. Dietary factors such as the spread of the "Western" diet, high in fat and protein but low in fruits and vegetables, may be associated with the increase. Although many studies have evaluated the association between diet and IBD risk, there has been no systematic review. METHODS: We performed a systematic review using guideline-recommended methodology to evaluate the association between pre-illness intake of nutrients (fats, carbohydrates, protein) and food groups (fruits, vegetables, meats) and the risk of subsequent IBD diagnosis. Eligible studies were identified via structured keyword searches in PubMed and Google Scholar and manual searches. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included, encompassing 2,609 IBD patients (1,269 Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,340 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients) and over 4,000 controls. Studies reported a positive association between high intake of saturated fats, monounsaturated fatty acids, total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), total omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, mono- and disaccharides, and meat and increased subsequent CD risk. Studies reported a negative association between dietary fiber and fruits and subsequent CD risk. High intakes of total fats, total PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were associated with an increased risk of UC. High vegetable intake was associated with a decreased risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: High dietary intakes of total fats, PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were associated with an increased risk of CD and UC. High fiber and fruit intakes were associated with decreased CD risk, and high vegetable intake was associated with decreased UC risk.},

METHOD: Seventy-two male SD rats were separated into 6 groups randomly. Rat model of ulcerative colitis was established by intra-colonic administration of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). Purslane (2.5, 5, 10 g x kg(-1)) and sulfasalazine(0.5 g x kg(-1)) was administered by enemata, 3 days after TNBS instillation and daily during 10 days before killing the rats. Colons were removed for histological analysis and measurement of myeloperoxidase (MPO). RESULT: Rats treated with purslane (5 and 10 g x kg(-1)) were significantly healthier than TNBS-alone rats, as shown by improved food intake and reduced diarrhea, corrected the disorders in morphology associated to lesions, significantly reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels. CONCLUSION: purslane exerts protective effect in experimental colitis, the effect seems to be related to relieving inflammatory reaction and repairing lesions.},

   abstract = {One of the promising approaches in the therapy of ulcerative colitis is administration of butyrate, an energy source for colonocytes, into the lumen of the colon. This study investigates the effect of butyrate producing bacterium Clostridium tyrobutyricum on dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Immunocompetent BALB/c and immunodeficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice reared in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions were treated intrarectally with C. tyrobutyricum 1 week prior to the induction of DSS colitis and during oral DSS treatment. Administration of DSS without C. tyrobutyricum treatment led to an appearance of clinical symptoms - bleeding, rectal prolapses and colitis-induced increase in the antigen CD11b, a marker of infiltrating inflammatory cells in the lamina propria. The severity of colitis was similar in BALB/c and SCID mice as judged by the histological damage score and colon shortening after 7 days of DSS treatment. Both strains of mice also showed a similar reduction in tight junction (TJ) protein zonula occludens (ZO)-1 expression and of MUC-2 mucin depression. Highly elevated levels of cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the colon of SCID mice and of interleukin (IL)-18 in BALB/c mice were observed. Intrarectal administration of C. tyrobutyricum prevented appearance of clinical symptoms of DSS-colitis, restored normal MUC-2 production, unaltered expression of TJ protein ZO-1 and decreased levels of TNF-alpha and IL-18 in the descending colon of SCID and BALB/c mice, respectively. Some of these features can be ascribed to the increased production of butyrate in the lumen of the colon and its role in protection of barrier functions and regulation of IL-18 expression.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis represent distinct phenotypic forms of inflammatory bowel disease and continue to be a common cause of morbidity. The corticosteroids and the immunomodulatory drugs, which are the basis of treatment for the inflammatory bowel diseases, do not assure always satisfactory outcomes. Nutrition has been used in order to modify the inflammatory response of various chronic inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases, the intestinal microflora and the intestinal mucosal disorders play a crucial role. Also, the release of reactive oxygen species is a significant factor of initiation and preservation of the inflammatory reaction in these diseases. The advantages of the nutritional treatment derive from the sequestration of intraluminal agents which may promote the inflammatory bowel response or, alternatively, nutrition is able to modify the immune response, reducing the uncontrolled inflammatory reaction. Furthermore, nutrition can enhance the mucosal barrier function and consists a significant source of antioxidants. This review focuses on certain nutritional components that modulate the inflammatory response of the bowel and aims to present a rational thesis regarding the use of nutritional agents in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: In previous studies, we described the beneficial effects of bifidobacteria-fermented milk in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Here, we examined the effects of a live Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult, a probiotic contained in bifidobacteria-fermented milk, and galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) as synbiotics in UC patients. METHODS: Forty-one patients with mild to moderate UC were assigned to two groups; one group was treated with the synbiotics and the other was not (control). The treatment group ingested 1 g of the probiotic powder (10(9) CFU/g) three times a day, and 5.5 g of GOS once a day for one year. At the start and the end of this study, colonoscopic index and the amount of myeloperoxidase in a lavage solution were used as disease activity indices. Bacterial counts in the feces at the start and the end of this study were also examined. RESULTS: After a one-year treatment with the synbiotics, the clinical status of the UC patients as assessed by colonoscopy, significantly improved. Furthermore, the amount of myeloperoxidase in the lavage also decreased in these patients after the synbiotic treatment. The synbiotics significantly reduced the fecal counts of Bacteroidaceae and fecal pH. CONCLUSION: Administration of live B. breve strain Yakult and GOS can improve the clinical condition of patients with UC. These results encouraged us to perform a large-scale randomized, placebo-controlled trial.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To identify environmental risk factors for developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children <15 years of age. METHODS: IBD patients and randomly selected healthy controls from a well defined geographical area in Denmark were prospectively recruited in the period 1.1.2007-31.12.2009. Data regarding socioeconomic status, area of residence, living conditions, infections and diet were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 118 IBD patients (59 Crohn's disease (CD), 56 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 IBD unclassified (IBDU)) and 477 healthy controls filled out the questionnaire. The response rates were 91% in patients and 45% in controls, respectively. Several risk factors for IBD were identified: IBD in first degree relatives (IBD: OR (odds ratio): 6.1 (95%CI: 2.5-15.0), CD (OR: 6.8 (2.3-20.2)) and UC (OR: 6.1 (2.3-16.0))); bedroom sharing (IBD: OR: 2.1 (1.0-4.3), CD (OR: 3.6 (1.3-9.4))); high sugar intake (IBD: OR: 2.5 (1.0-6.2), CD (OR: 2.9 (1.0-8.5))); prior admission to a hospital for gastrointestinal infections (IBD: 7.7 (3.1-19.1), CD (7.9 (2.5-24.9)) and UC (7.4 (2.5-21.6))); stressful events (IBD: 1.7 (1.0-2.9)). Protective factors were daily vs. less than daily vegetable consumption (CD: 0.3 (0.1-1.0), UC (0.3 (0.1-0.8))) and whole meal bread consumption (IBD: OR: 0.5 (0.3-0.9), CD (0.4 (0.2-0.9))). An increased risk of diagnosis of CD compared to UC was shown for patients living in more urban areas (OR: 1.3 (1.1-1.6)). CONCLUSION: We identified several risk and protective factors for developing IBD. Studies on the influence of environmental factors are important in our understanding of aetiology and phenotypes of paediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {The incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases has increased during recent decades. Within the colon, the families of mucins (MUC) and trefoil factors (TFF) facilitate mucosal protection. Probiotic administration influences the intestinal MUC layer. Additionally, food components may affect gut microflora or have direct effects on the MUC barrier. Our objective was to determine whether diet and/or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) would mediate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis by altering expression of the MUC and TFF genes. C57BL/6 mice were fed diets containing 20% (wt:wt) casein, soy, or whey proteins with or without LGG for 12 d. Seven days after starting LGG diets, the mice were given 2% DSS in drinking water for 4 d. Two additional casein groups with or without LGG were given tap water, for a total of 8 groups. One day after the DSS treatment, the mice were killed and the colon and cecum tissues and cecum contents were collected and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Whey protein significantly increased cecal LGG content compared with the other diets. In the casein diet groups, MUC1 and TFF-3 expression in colon was significantly induced by DSS independent of LGG. Compared with other DSS-treated groups, soy protein decreased MUC-1 and TFF-3 in the colon. Similarly, soy protein decreased the impact of DSS on inflammatory scores, TNFalpha gene expression, and colon shortening. There was no overall effect of LGG on these measurements. In conclusion, soy protein suppressed the DSS-induced inflammatory stimulation of MUC, TFF, and TNFalpha gene expression independently of LGG.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Mounting evidence suggests an important role for the intestinal microbiota in the chronic mucosal inflammation that occurs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and novel molecular approaches have further identified a dysbiosis in these patients. Several mechanisms of action of probiotic products that may interfere with possible aetiological factors in IBD have been postulated. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to discuss the rationale for probiotics in IBD and to systematically review clinical intervention studies with probiotics in the management of IBD in adults. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed up to 1 October 2011, using defined keywords. Only full-text papers in the English language addressing clinical outcomes in adult patients were included. The 41 eligible studies were categorized on disease type (ulcerative colitis [UC] with/without an ileo-anal pouch and Crohn's disease [CD]) and disease activity. Pooled odds ratios were only calculated per probiotic for a specific patient group when more than one randomized controlled trial was available. RESULTS: Well designed randomized controlled trials supporting the application of probiotics in the management of IBD are still limited. Meta-analyses could only be performed for a limited number of studies revealing overall risk ratios of 2.70 (95% CI 0.47, 15.33) for inducing remission in active UC with Bifido-fermented milk versus placebo or no additive treatment (n = 2); 1.88 (95% CI 0.96, 3.67) for inducing remission in active UC with VSL#3 versus placebo (n = 2); 1.08 (95% CI 0.86, 1.37) for preventing relapses in inactive UC with Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 versus standard treatment (n = 3); 0.17 (95% CI 0.09, 0.33) for preventing relapses in inactive UC/ileo-anal pouch anastomosis (IPAA) patients with VSL#3 versus placebo; 1.21 (95% CI 0.57, 2.57) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in inactive CD with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG versus placebo (n = 2); and 0.93 (95% CI 0.63, 1.38) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in inactive CD with Lactobacillus johnsonii versus placebo (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Further well designed studies based on intention-to-treat analyses by several independent research groups are still warranted to support the promising results for E. coli Nissle in inactive UC and the multispecies product VSL#3 in active UC and inactive pouch patients. So far, no evidence is available to support the use of probiotics in CD. Future studies should focus on specific disease subtypes and disease location. Further insight into the aetiology of IBD and the mechanisms of probiotic strains will aid in selecting probiotic strains for specific disease entities and disease locations.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic recurrent disease characterized by acute inflammation of the colonic mucosa. In Japan, a dietary supplementation product enriched with glutamine, dietary fiber, and oligosaccharide (GFO) is widely applied for enteral nutrition support. These three components have been suggested to improve intestinal health. In this study, we investigated whether GFO has suppressive effects on mucosal damage in ulcerative colitis in an experimental mouse model. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice received 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water for 5 d to induce colitis. Then, they were given 0.25 mL of GFO or a 20% glucose solution twice daily for 10 d. Another set of mice receiving unaltered drinking water was used as the normal control group. RESULTS: The body weight loss and disease activity index were significantly lower in the GFO-treated mice compared with the glucose-treated mice (P < 0.05). The decrease in colon length induced by dextran sulfate sodium was significantly alleviated in GFO-treated mice compared with glucose-treated mice (P < 0.01). In addition, the histologic findings showed that intestinal inflammation was significantly attenuated in mice treated with GFO. Furthermore, treatment with GFO significantly inhibited the dextran sulfate sodium-induced increase in the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that GFO has potential therapeutic value as an adjunct therapy for ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fecal bacteriotherapy (FB) has been proposed as a safe and effective alternative treatment for a number of gastrointestinal conditions including ulcerative colitis (UC). We performed a qualitative study to explore the attitudes and concerns of adult patients and parents of children with UC regarding FB as a potential treatment. METHODS: We conducted six focus groups for adult patients with UC and parents of children with UC or indeterminate colitis. Participants were asked about their perceptions of and interest in FB as a treatment for UC. Sessions were recorded, transcribed, and reviewed to identify domains, themes, and major concepts. RESULTS: The focus groups included 15 adult patients and seven parents of children with colitis. We identified five major domains pertaining to FB: impressions of treatment, benefits, risks, potential mechanisms, and social concerns. All but one participant expressed interest in FB and several wished it were already available. Participants compared FB to probiotics, felt it was "natural," easier than current therapies, and with donor screening would be safe. Although initial distaste and the "yuck factor" were uniformly mentioned, these concerns were outweighed by perceived benefits. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine important ethical and social issues surrounding FB as a treatment for UC. Given adequate supporting research, donor selection, and screening, adult patients and parents of children with UC will consider FB and are eager for it to become available. These findings have important implications for future microbiome-based treatments.},

The objective of this study was to investigate whether inclusion of this bacterial meal in the diet could abrogate disease development in a murine model of epithelial injury and colitis and thus possibly have therapeutic potential in human inflammatory bowel disease. C57BL/6N mice were fed ad libitum a control diet or an experimental diet containing 254 g/kg of body weight BioProtein, a bacterial meal consisting of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), together with the heterogenic bacteria Ralstonia sp., Brevibacillus agri, and Aneurinibacillus sp. At day 8, colitis was induced by 3.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) ad libitum in the drinking water for 6 days. Symptoms of DSS treatment were less profound after prophylactic treatment with the diet containing the BioProtein. Colitis-associated parameters such as reduced body weight, colon shortening, and epithelial damage also showed significant improvement. Levels of acute-phase reactants, proteins whose plasma concentrations increase in response to inflammation, and neutrophil infiltration were reduced. On the other, increased epithelial cell proliferation and enhanced mucin 2 (Muc2) transcription indicated improved integrity of the colonic epithelial layer. BioProtein mainly consists of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) (88%). The results that we obtained when using a bacterial meal consisting of M. capsulatus (Bath) were similar to those obtained when using BioProtein in the DSS model. Our results show that a bacterial meal of the noncommensal bacterium M. capsulatus (Bath) has the potential to attenuate DSS-induced colitis in mice by enhancing colonic barrier function, as judged by increased epithelial proliferation and increased Muc2 transcription.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) is a prebiotic product that reduces colonic mucosal inflammation and the clinical symptoms observed in ulcerative colitis (UC). The risk of contracting colorectal cancer is higher in patients with UC than in that of the general population. The aim of this study is to apply this prebiotic approach to control chronic colitis and to reduce the incidence of colitic cancer. METHODS: Repeated and intermitted dextran sulfate sodium administration to male Sprague-Dawley rats was used for the chronic and subacute colitis models. GBF was added as the diet (10% w/v). The incidence of adenomatous high-grade dysplasia, and pathophysiological observations, including the proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labeling index, and clinical score, cecal organic acid profile, and the accompanying beta-glucosidase activity were determined. RESULTS: In the chronic phase, the incidence of adenomatous dysplasia was only confirmed in the control group, and the GBF group had no dysplasia in the entire colon; the stratified squamous epithelium area of GBF was significantly lower than that of the controls. GBF treatment significantly lowered the cecal succinate content and significantly increased beta-glucosidase activity compared to the controls. In addition, colonic mucosal inflammatory damage was comparable between the two groups, while the PCNA labeling index of the colonic mucosa in the GBF group was significantly lower than that of the control group. However, in the subacute phase, the mucosal damage score of GBF was significantly attenuated, and the PCNA labeling index of the colonic mucosa in the GBF group was significantly higher than that of the control group. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study demonstrated that GBF effectively prevents colitis-related dysplasia and inflammatory change in chronic and subacute colitis models by modulating the intestinal environment as a prebiotic. This prebiotic might contribute to the prevention of mucosal damage, to show different proliferative effects on the epithelium in the regeneration and steady states.},

METHODS: The study included 39 patients with mild to moderate UC defined as a Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) > 4 and < 12 (median: 7.5), who were treated open-label with Profermin((R)) twice daily for 24 wk. Daily SCCAI was reported observer blinded via the Internet. RESULTS: In an intention to treat (ITT) analysis, the mean reduction in SCCAI score was 56.5%. Of the 39 patients, 24 (62%) reached the primary endpoint, which was proportion of patients with >/= 50% reduction in SCCAI. Our secondary endpoint, the proportion of patients in remission defined as SCCAI </= 2.5, was in ITT analysis reached in 18 of the 39 patients (46%). In a repeated-measure regression analysis, the estimated mean reduction in score was 5.0 points (95% CI: 4.1-5.9, P < 0.001) and the estimated mean time taken to obtain half the reduction in score was 28 d (95% CI: 26-30). There were no serious adverse events (AEs) or withdrawals due to AEs. Profermin((R)) was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Profermin((R)) is safe and may be effective in inducing remission of active UC.},

   abstract = {Embelin has been used to treat fever, inflammatory diseases, and a variety of gastrointestinal ailments for thousands of years. Although reports indicate that embelin has anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects, its effects on ulcerative colitis have not been previously explored. The purpose of the present work was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of embelin on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Experimental colitis was induced in BALB/c mice by dissolving 5% DSS in their drinking water for 7days. Embelin (10, 30 or 50mg/kg body weight) was administrated daily per oral route for 7days. Embelin significantly attenuated DSS-induced DAI scores and tissue MPO accumulation, which implied that it suppressed weight loss, diarrhea, gross bleeding, and the infiltrations of immune cells. Embelin administration also effectively and dose-dependently prevented shortening of colon length and enlargement of spleen size. Histological examinations indicated that embelin suppressed edema, mucosal damage, and the loss of crypts induced by DSS. Furthermore, embelin inhibited the abnormal secretions and mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6. These results suggest that embelin has an anti-inflammatory effect at colorectal sites that is due to the down-regulations of the productions and expressions of inflammatory mediators, and that it may have therapeutic value in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).},

Up to four samples per individual were collected over 2 years giving a total of 124 samples. Multivariate discriminant analysis, based on NMR data from all three groups, was able to predict UC and C group membership with good sensitivity and specificity; classification of IBS samples was less successful and could not be used for diagnosis. Trends were detected toward increased taurine and cadaverine levels in UC with increased bile acid and decreased branched chain fatty acids in IBS relative to controls; changes in short chain fatty acids and amino acids were not significant. Previous PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis of the same fecal material had shown alterations of the gut microbiota when comparing UC and IBS groups with controls. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that DGGE profiles from the same individual were stable over time, but NMR spectra were more variable; canonical correlation analysis of NMR and DGGE data partly separated the three groups and revealed a correlation between the gut microbiota profile and metabolite composition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease that characteristically has a relapsing and remitting course. Probiotics might possibly induce remission in the treatment of active UC. Aims of our study were to assess the efficacy of VSL#3 on clinical response and colonic tissue cytokine concentration changes in patients with active UC. METHODS: Twenty-four eligible patients with mild to moderate UC received open-label VSL#3 4 sachets daily in 2 divided doses for 8 weeks. The disease activity pre- and post-VSL#3 therapy was assessed by ulcerative colitis disease activity score and colonic tissue cytokine profiling done at baseline and at week 8. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (mean age, 43.7 years; range, 20-70 years; male/female, 15/9) were enrolled and 2 patients did not have the final endoscopic assessment. A total of 22 patients were analyzed. Intent to treat analysis demonstrated remission in 45.8% of subjects (n=11); partial response in 20.8% (n=5); no change or worse in 25.0% (n=6) of subjects. The mean ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI) scores decreased from 7.09+/-1.81 to 1.45+/-1.29 in patients with a remission (p<0.001). The mean endoscopic scores had also significantly decreased from 1.91+/-0.54 to 0.63+/-0.50 in patients with a remission (p<0.001). The concentrations of colonic cytokines did not change significantly during treatment in patients with a remission. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that VSL#3 is effective in achieving clinical responses and remissions in patients with mild-to moderately active UC, further supporting the potential role in UC therapy.},

   abstract = {Tributyrin (TBT) is a TAG composed of three butyric acids that has beneficial effects on ulcerative colitis due to its trophic, anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic and anti-carcinogenic properties. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of action of TBT supplementation in the prevention of mucosal damage in experimental colitis. Mice received either a control diet or a TBT-supplemented diet for 15 d. Colitis was induced by dextran sodium sulphate administration during the last 7 d. Mucosal damage and the activation of immune cells and cytokines were determined by histological score, flow cytometry and ELISA. Leucocyte rolling and adhesion were assessed by intravital microscopy. Oxidative stress was determined by monitoring hydroperoxide concentration and evaluating superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities. Intestinal permeability was analysed using diethylenetriaminepentaacetate acid (99mTcDTPA). Compared with the colitis group, the animals in the colitis+TBT group had reduced mucosal damage and neutrophil and eosinophil mucosal infiltration, which were associated with a higher percentage of regulatory T cells (Treg) and higher levels of transforming growth factor beta and IL-10 in the lamina propria. The level of in vivo leucocyte adhesion in the colon microvasculature was reduced after TBT supplementation. A lower level of hydroperoxide and higher levels of SOD and catalase activities were associated with TBT supplementation. TBT-supplemented mice showed reduced intestinal permeability to the levels intermediate between the control and colitis groups. In conclusion, the present results show that TBT has positive effects on colonic restructuring in experimental colitis. Additionally, TBT supplementation changes the immune response by controlling inflammation and regulating the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and Treg.},

METHODS: Sixty rats were divided into normal control group, ulcerative colitis group, ulcerative colitis with syndrome of spleen deficiency and dampness stagnancy group (model group) and strengthening spleen for resolving dampness group. Ulcerative colitis in rats was induced by enema containing trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) and ethanol. The rats in the model group were suffered from standing in water, limiting sleeping time and abnormal diet based on administration of TNBS and ethanol. The rats in the spleen strengthening and dampness resolving group were gastrically administered with Shenlin Baizhu Powder, a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine. Symptoms, signs and pathological changes in colon tissue of rats were observed after modeling. The levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in serum of rats were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The rats in the model group showed lethargy, poor appetite, loss of energy, diarrhea and bloody stool. Their body weight decreased significantly compared with the normal control group, and similar changes were found in the comparison of food intake, drinking amount, urine amount, stool wet weight and assay of spontaneous activity (P<0.05). When observed under a light microscope, the colon tissues of rats in the model group showed mucosal edema, congestion, inflammatory cell infiltration and ulceration. The degree of colon injury and IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha levels were significantly increased (P<0.05) as compared to those in the normal control group. The changes mentioned above were improved by Shenlin Baizhu Powder (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The rat model of ulcerative colitis with syndrome of spleen deficiency and dampness stagnancy is successfully induced and has the characteristics of ulcerative colitis of humans both in pathological changes and in syndrome.},

   abstract = {Many different kinds of fermented food are consumed daily in Taiwan, such as stinky tofu, suan-tsai, and fu-tsai. We have previously reported the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) at different stages of fermentation in the production of suan-tsai and fu-tsai. In this study, the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities of Lactobacillus plantarum K68 (K68) isolated from fu-tsai were evaluated. K68 significantly inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells and stimulated interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs). Additionally, orally administered K68 ameliorated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in BALB/c mice. Both the disease activity index (DAI) and histological scores (HIS) showed that the severity of UC was significantly reduced by oral administration of K68. Furthermore, the production of pro inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly reduced in K68-administered group. Colonic mRNA expression levels of TNF-alpha, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), and toll like receptor 4 (TLR4), were also reduced in the K68-administered group. These results suggest that K68 exhibits anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities that ameliorate DSS-induced experimental colitis.},

   abstract = {Nutritional assessment and dietary advice are fundamental to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient management and all patients should have access to a dietitian. Newly diagnosed patients often think that their pre-illness diet has contributed to the development of their IBD. However, epidemiological evidence to support diet as a risk factor is lacking. How the diet contributes to the gastrointestinal microbiota is interesting, although the role is not yet clearly defined. Nutritional problems in IBD are common. Malnutrition occurs in up to 85% of patients and weight loss affects up to 80% of patients with Crohn's disease and 18-62% of patients with ulcerative colitis. Nutritional deficiencies are prevalent, particularly in relation to anaemia and osteoporosis. Intestinal strictures can be problematic in Crohn's disease and limiting fibrous foods that may cause a mechanical obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract is helpful. Patients often explore dietary exclusion to alleviate symptoms but such changes may be self-directed or inappropriately advised and can lead to further nutritional deficiencies. Some patients experience concurrent functional symptoms (e.g. abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence and diarrhoea) that can significantly affect quality of life. Recently, a group of poorly absorbed carbohydrates that occur naturally in the diet called fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols have been associated with functional symptoms by intestinal bacterial fermentation leading to rapid gas production, and an osmotic effect increasing fluid delivery to the colon. Emerging evidence indicates that a diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols can alleviate functional symptoms in IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a risk factor for the development of colon cancer. Environmental factors including diet and the microflora influence disease outcome. Folate and homocysteine have been associated with IBD-mediated colon cancer but their roles remain unclear. We used a model of chemically induced ulcerative colitis (dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)) with or without the colon carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) to determine the impact of dietary folic acid (FA) on colonic microflora and the development of colon tumours. Male mice (n 15 per group) were fed a FA-deficient (0 mg/kg), control (2 mg/kg) or FA-supplemented (8 mg/kg) diet for 12 weeks. Folate status was dependent on the diet (P< 0.001) and colitis-induced treatment (P= 0.04) such that mice with colitis had lower circulating folate. FA had a minimal effect on tumour initiation, growth and progression, although FA-containing diets tended to be associated with a higher tumour prevalence in DSS-treated mice (7-20 v. 0%, P= 0.08) and the development of more tumours in the distal colon of AOM-treated mice (13-83% increase, P= 0.09). Folate deficiency was associated with hyperhomocysteinaemia (P< 0.001) but homocysteine negatively correlated with tumour number (r - 0.58, P= 0.02) and load (r - 0.57, P= 0.02). FA had no effect on the intestinal microflora. The present data indicate that FA intake has no or little effect on IBD or IBD-mediated colon cancer in this model and that hyperhomocysteinaemia is a biomarker of dietary status and malabsorption rather than a cause of IBD-mediated colon cancer.},

   abstract = {Complex and highly variable site-dependent bacterial ecosystems exist throughout the length of the human gastrointestinal tract. Until relatively recently, the majority of our information on intestinal microbiotas has come from studies on feces, or from aspirates taken from the upper gut. However, there is evidence showing that mucosal bacteria growing in biofilms on surfaces lining the gut differ from luminal populations, and that due to their proximity to the epithelial surface, these organisms may be important in modulating the host's immune system and contributing to some chronic inflammatory diseases. Over the past decade, increasing interest in mucosal bacteria, coupled with advances in molecular approaches for assessing microbial diversity, has begun to provide some insight into the complexity of these mucosa-associated communities. In gastrointestinal conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), it has been shown that a dysbiosis exists in microbial community structure, and that there is a reduction in putatively protective mucosal organisms such as bifidobacteria. Therefore, manipulation of mucosal communities may be beneficial in restoring normal functionality in the gut, thereby improving the immune status and general health of the host. Biofilm structure and function has been studied intensively in the oral cavity, and as a consequence, mucosal communities in the mouth will not be covered in this chapter. This review addresses our current knowledge of mucosal populations in the gastrointestinal tract, changes that can occur in community structure in disease, and therapeutic modulation of biofilm composition by antibiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics.},

   abstract = {A complex set of interactions between the human genes encoding innate protective functions and immune defenses and the environment of the intestinal mucosa with its microbiota is currently considered key to the pathogenesis of the chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Probiotics offer a method to potentially alter the intestinal microbiome exogenously or may provide an option to deliver microbial metabolic products to alter the chronicity of intestinal mucosal inflammation characterizing IBD. At present, there is little evidence for the benefit of currently used probiotic microbes in Crohn's disease or associated conditions affecting extra-intestinal organs. However, clinical practice guidelines are now including a probiotic as an option for recurrent and relapsing antibiotic sensitive pouchitis and the use of probiotics in mild ulcerative colitis is provocative and suggests potential for benefit in select patients but concerns remain about proof from trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment resistant chronic pouchitis causes significant morbidity. Elemental diet is effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Since pouchitis shares some similarities to Crohn's disease we hypothesised that elemental diet may be an effective treatment. METHOD: Seven pouchitis patients (with ulcerative colitis) were studied. All had active pouchitis with a pouch disease activity index (PDAI) >/=7. Exclusion criteria were recent NSAIDs, antibiotics or probiotics. Sufficient elemental diet to achieve energy requirements was provided. Flexible-pouchoscopy was performed, and the Cleveland Global Quality of Life score (CGQoL), Pouch Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and BMI were recorded at baseline and following 28 days of elemental diet. Faecal samples were also collected at these time points and analysed for major bacterial groups using culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Data were analysed using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. RESULTS: Following 28 days of exclusive elemental diet, median stool frequency decreased from 12 to 6 per day (p=0.028), median clinical PDAI decreased from 4 to 1 (p=0.039). There was no significant difference in quality of life scores or PDAI before and following treatment. There was a trend towards an increase in the concentration of Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale (median 7.9 to 8.5 log(1)(0)/g, p=0.08) following exclusive elemental diet. CONCLUSION: Treatment with four weeks elemental diet appeared to improve the symptoms of chronic pouchitis in some patients but is not an effective strategy for inducing remission. Although a potential symptom modifier, elemental diet cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of active pouchitis.},

Over the last decade, the rational to use probiotics and its beneficial efficacy in the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasingly under scrutiny. Although it has become clear that intestinal epithelial-mucosal immune interactions and enteric bacteria play a critical role in the development of IBD, the substantial clinical efficacy of probiotics in these disorders is less evident. This review outlines the clinical studies regarding probiotics before October 2007. These studies formed the foundation of probiotic clinical trials in IBD, but they also indicated the need of larger and better-controlled studies than the past experimental approaches. Furthermore, this review also examines in-depth the probiotic clinical trials published between 2007 and December 2010, providing new insights into the role of probiotics for inducing and maintaining remission of IBD, and highlighting some of the breakthroughs, especially regarding induction of remission for ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have access to a growing number of probiotic products marketed to improve digestive health. It is unclear how patients make decisions about probiotics and what role they expect their gastroenterologists to play as they consider using probiotics. Understanding patients' knowledge, attitudes and expectations of probiotics may help gastroenterologists engage patients in collaborative discussions about probiotics. STUDY: Focus groups were conducted with patients with IBD and IBS at the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and Johns Hopkins University. Inductive analytic methods were used to identify common themes and draw interpretations from focus group narratives. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six patients participated in 22 focus groups between March and August 2009. Patients viewed probiotics as an appealing alternative to pharmaceutical drugs and understood probiotics as a more "natural," low-risk therapeutic option. Many patients were hesitant to use them without consulting their gastroenterologists. Patients would weigh the risks and benefits of probiotics, their disease severity and satisfaction with current treatments when considering probiotic use. CONCLUSIONS: Patients are interested in probiotics but have many unanswered questions about their use. Our findings suggest that patients with IBD and IBS will look to gastroenterologists and other clinicians as trustworthy advisors regarding the utility of probiotics as an alternative or supplement to pharmaceutical drugs. Gastroenterologists and other clinicians who care for patients with these diseases should be prepared to discuss the potential benefits and risks of probiotics and assist patients in making informed decisions about their use.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colonic mucosa that can dramatically increase the risk of colon cancers. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a dietary intervention of freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB), a natural food product with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bioactivities, on disease severity in an experimental mouse model of UC using 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). C57BL/6J mice were fed either a control diet or a diet containing BRB (5 or 10%) for 7-14 days and then the extent of colonic injury was assessed. Dietary BRB markedly reduced DSS-induced acute injury to the colonic epithelium. This protection included better maintenance of body mass and reductions in colonic shortening and ulceration. BRB treatment, however, did not affect the levels of either plasma nitric oxide or colon malondialdehyde, biomarkers of oxidative stress that are otherwise increased by DSS-induced colonic injury. BRB treatment for up to 7 days suppressed tissue levels of several key pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1beta. Further examination of the inflammatory response by western blot analysis revealed that 7 day BRB treatment reduced the levels of phospho-IkappaBalpha within the colonic tissue. Colonic cyclooxygenase 2 levels were also dramatically suppressed by BRB treatment, with a concomitant decrease in the plasma prostaglandin E(2) (276 versus 34 ng/ml). These findings demonstrate a potent anti-inflammatory effect of BRB during DSS-induced colonic injury, supporting its possible therapeutic or preventive role in the pathogenesis of UC and related neoplastic events.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic relapsing disease characterised by diffuse mucosal inflammation limited to the colon. Current maintenance treatments have multiple adverse events and an effective treatment with minimal adverse events is desired. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of intestinal flora in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. It has been suggested that modifying the bacterial flora with probiotics may attenuate the inflammatory process and prevent relapses in ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives were to determine the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Tials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2011), EMBASE (1974 to July 2011), CINAHL (1982 to July 2011) and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialised Trial Register were searched. Manufacturers of probiotics were contacted to identify any unpublished trials. References of trials were also searched for any additional trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared probiotics against placebo or any other intervention for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality of included studies were independently performed by two authors. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of clinical or endoscopic relapse. MAIN RESULTS: Four studies (n = 587) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Three trials compared probiotics to mesalazine and one trial compared probiotics with placebo. The studies ranged in length from 3 to 12 months. The risk of bias was high in two studies due to incomplete outcome data and lack of blinding. The methods used for allocation concealment were unclear for all four studies. There was no statistically significant difference between probiotics and mesalazine for maintenance of remission in UC. Relapse was reported in 40.1% of patients in the probiotics group compared to 34.1% of patients in the mesalazine group (3 studies; 555 patients: OR 1.33; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.90 ; I(2) = 11%). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse events. Twenty-six per cent of patients in the probiotics group experienced at least one adverse event compared to 24% of patients in the mesalazine group (2 studies; 430 patients OR 1.21; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.84; I(2) =27%). Adverse events reported in the mesalazine-controlled studies include diarrhea, mucous secretion, bloody stools, abdominal pain, flatulence and distension, nausea and vomiting and headache. A small placebo controlled trial (n = 32) found no statistically significant difference in efficacy. Seventy-five per cent of probiotic patients relapsed at one year compared to 92% of placebo patients (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.03 to 2.68). Adverse events reported in the placebo-controlled study include flatulence, abdominal bloating and pain, changes in faecal consistency, arthralgia, sacroiliitis, tiredness, incontinence, stress, oral blisters, eye dryness, headache, dizziness, influenza, gastroenteritis, cystitis and pneumonia. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Given the relatively small number of patients in the pooled analysis, the small number of events and the high risk and unclear risk of bias in the included studies, there is insufficient evidence to make conclusions about the efficacy of probiotics for maintenance of remission in UC. There is a lack of well-designed RCTs in this area and further research is needed.},

   abstract = {In vitro and animals models have long been used to study human diseases and identify novel therapeutic approaches that can be applied to combat these conditions. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two main entities of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is an intricate relationship between IBD features in human patients, in vitro and animal colitis models, mechanisms and possible therapeutic approaches in these models, and strategies that can be extrapolated and applied in humans. Malnutrition, particularly protein-energy malnutrition and vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies, as well as dysregulation of the intestinal microbiota, are common features of IBD. Based on these observations, dietary supplementation with essential nutrients known to be in short supply in the diet in IBD patients and with other molecules believed to provide beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, as well as with probiotic organisms that stimulate immune functions and resistance to infection has been tested in colitis models. Here we review current knowledge on nutritional and probiotic supplementation in in vitro and animal colitis models. While some of these strategies require further fine-tuning before they can be applied in human IBD patients, their intended purpose is to prevent, delay or treat disease symptoms in a non-pharmaceutical manner.},

Although biological agents are alternative treatments, they may not be suitable or available to some patients. AIM: To review the evidence for use of nonbiological drugs in the treatment of patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines. METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed for English language publications with predetermined search criteria to identify relevant studies. RESULTS: Published evidence from uncontrolled series and controlled clinical trials has been used to produce a practical approach relevant to clinical practice which incorporates the indication, optimal dose, and side effects of various therapies including tacrolimus, methotrexate, thalidomide, tioguanine, mycophenolate mofotil, leucocyte apheresis, nutritional therapy, antibiotics, probiotics, allopurinol, rectal acetarsol and ciclosporin in the treatment of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Approaches to optimise thiopurine efficacy are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines may respond to alternative anti-inflammatory chemical molecules, but the evidence base for many of these alternatives is limited and further trials are needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: The effect of vitamin D supplementation on immune disorders has been a topical research focus. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the current evidence of the effect of vitamin D supplementation as a therapy for colitis. METHODS: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Cinicaltrials.gov and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using the terms 'inflammatory bowel disease' 'Crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'colitis' [and] 'vitamin D'. Both human and animal studies published in English language were examined. The reference lists of included studies and review articles were manually searched for any relevant studies. RESULTS: Four studies were included in this systematic review. All reported an improvement in disease activity with vitamin D supplementation. The only high quality human study reported a non-significant reduction of relapse rate for Crohn's disease. No major adverse effects of vitamin D supplementation were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is some evidence that supplemental vitamin D, as an adjunctive treatment, may help in controlling colitis, this evidence is not enough to justify using vitamin D in treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Large high quality placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials are needed to explore a possible benefit of using vitamin D in treating IBD.},

   abstract = {IBD is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gut that demands long-lasting treatment targeting both flare-up periods and maintenance of remission. Oral systemic steroids have been used to induce remission in patients with active IBD for over 50 years due to their potent anti-inflammatory effects. The efficacy of systemic steroids in this setting has been largely demonstrated. However, the wide range of adverse events associated with these drugs has prompted the development of equally effective but less toxic steroid compounds. Currently, topically acting oral steroids are an important therapeutic option for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and microscopic colitis, being oral budesonide and oral beclomethasone established elements of the IBD armamentarium. At present, oral budesonide is the first-line therapy to induce remission in microscopic colitis and mild to moderate ileocaecal CD patients and oral beclomethasone is effective treating mild to moderate UC patients with left-sided or extensive disease. This review aims at evaluating the current role of these compounds in IBD clinical practice.},

AIM: To assess in children with active distal UC the effectiveness of Lactobacillus (L) reuteri ATCC 55730 enema on inflammation and cytokine expression of rectal mucosa. METHODS: A total of 40 patients (median age: 7.2 years range 6-18) with mild to moderate UC were enrolled in a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled study. They received an enema solution containing 10(10) CFU of L. reuteri ATCC 55730 or placebo for 8 weeks, in addition to oral mesalazine. Clinical endoscopic and histological scores as well as rectal mucosal expression levels of IL-10, IL-1beta, TNFalpha and IL-8 were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the trial. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients accomplished the trial (17 males, median age 13 year, range 7-18). Mayo score (including clinical and endoscopic features) decreased significantly in the L. reuteri group (3.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 8.6 +/- 0.8, P < 0.01) compared with placebo (7.1 +/- 1.1 vs. 8.7 +/- 0.7, NS); furthermore, histological score significantly decrease only in the L. reuteri group (0.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.6, P < 0.01) (placebo: 2.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.6 +/- 0.6, NS). At the post-trial evaluation of cytokine mucosal expression levels, IL-10 significantly increased (P < 0.01) whereas IL-1beta, TNFalpha and IL-8 significantly decreased (P < 0.01) only in the L. reuteri group. CONCLUSIONS: In children with active distal ulcerative colitis, rectal infusion of L. reuteri is effective in improving mucosal inflammation and changing mucosal expression levels of some cytokines involved in the mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease.},

CAM services were utilized by 27% (95% CI: 23-31) of the patients, 21% (95% CI: 16-23) reported use of CAM products, and 28% (95% CI: 23-31) used CAM self-help practices. The most common pattern of CAM use was to combine CAM services and CAM products. Significantly, more UC patients (56%) than CD patients (44%) reported CAM use, p = 0.03. In UC, only the presence of at least one comorbid condition was directly related to CAM use. In CD, being a woman, being aged 31-50 years, having a higher education level, and experiencing adverse drug reactions from IBD medication were factors independently associated with the use of CAM. CONCLUSION: Use of CAM was common among IBD patients attending outpatient clinics. Both demographic and clinical factors were associated to CAM use, but the factors differed in their significance for UC and CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In ulcerative colitis (UC), reduction of inflammation may represent a key mechanism in UC therapy, and anti-inflammatory agents would be good candidates for preventing UC. Kaempferol, a natural flavonoid, is believed to have anti-inflammatory activities and has been shown to be potentially immune-modulatory. AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine whether kaempferol alleviates the inflammatory responses of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. METHODS: Female C57BL/6J mice were divided into six groups: a negative control group, a DSS control group, and DSS + 0.1% or 0.3% kaempferol pre- or post-fed groups. At the end of the experimental period, clinical and biochemical markers were evaluated. RESULTS: Plasma levels of NO and PGE(2) were significantly decreased in both the 0.3% kaempferol pre- and post-fed groups. The plasma LTB(4) level was profoundly decreased in all animals fed kaempferol. Colonic mucosa MPO activity was also suppressed in both the 0.3% kaempferol pre- or post-fed groups. TFF3 mRNA, a marker for goblet cell function, was up-regulated in kaempferol pre-fed animals. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that kaempferol is an effective anti-inflammatory agent that protects colonic mucosa from DSS-induced UC. Dietary kaempferol fed prior to colitis induction was more effective to suppress some of the colitis-associated markers.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Aloe has been a very popular folk remedy for inflammation-related pathological conditions despite the lack of studies reporting its efficacy in vivo. The present study evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of aloe components (aloin, aloesin and aloe-gel) known to be biologically active in the rat model of colitis. MAIN METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed experimental diets for 2 weeks before and during the induction of colitis. Drinking water containing 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) was provided for 1 week to induce colitis. At the end of the experimental period, clinical and biochemical markers were compared. KEY FINDINGS: Plasma leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations were significantly decreased in all groups supplemented with aloe components compared to the colitis control group (p<0.05). Animals fed both a 0.1% and 0.5% aloesin supplemented diet showed colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities which were decreased by 32.2% and 40.1%, respectively (p<0.05). Colonic mucosa TNF-alpha and interleukin-1ss (IL-1beta) mRNA expressions were significantly reduced in all animals fed aloin, aloesin, or aloe-gel (p<0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: Dietary supplementation of aloe components ameliorates intestinal inflammatory responses in a DSS-induced ulcerative colitis rat model. In particular, aloesin was the most potent inhibitor. Further studies are required for a more complete understanding of the specific mechanism of the action of these supplements.},

Our aim was to describe the proteomic profile of UC and search for markers associated with disease exacerbation. Therefore, we aimed to characterize specific proteins associated with inflamed colon mucosa from patients with acute UC using mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. METHODS: Biopsies were sampled from rectum, sigmoid colon and left colonic flexure from twenty patients with active proctosigmoiditis and from four healthy controls for proteomics and histology. Proteomic profiles of whole colonic biopsies were characterized using 2D-gel electrophoresis, and peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was applied for identification of differently expressed protein spots. RESULTS: A total of 597 spots were annotated by image analysis and 222 of these had a statistically different protein level between inflamed and non-inflamed tissue in the patient group. Principal component analysis clearly grouped non-inflamed samples separately from the inflamed samples indicating that the proteomic signature of colon mucosa with acute UC is strong. Totally, 43 individual protein spots were identified, including proteins involved in energy metabolism (triosephosphate isomerase, glycerol-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase, alpha enolase and L-lactate dehydrogenase B-chain) and in oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase, thioredoxins and selenium binding protein). CONCLUSIONS: A distinct proteomic profile of inflamed tissue in UC patients was found. Specific proteins involved in energy metabolism and oxidative stress were identified as potential candidate markers for UC.},

   abstract = {In vitro and animal studies point to numerous mechanisms by which fatty acids, especially long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), can modulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. These data strongly suggest that improving the fatty acid supply of young children in low-income countries might have immune benefits. Unfortunately, there have been virtually no studies of fatty acid/immune interactions in such settings. Clinical trial registers list over 150 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving PUFAs, only one in a low-income setting (the Gambia). We summarize those results here. There was evidence for improved growth and nutritional status, but the primary end point of chronic environmental enteropathy showed no benefit, possibly because the infants were still substantially breastfed. In high-income settings, there have been RCTs with fatty acids (usually LCPUFAs) in relation to 18 disease end points, for some of which there have been numerous trials (asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis). For these diseases, the evidence is judged reasonable for risk reduction for childhood asthma (but not in adults), as yielding possible benefit in Crohn's disease (insufficient evidence in ulcerative colitis) and for convincing evidence for rheumatoid arthritis at sufficient dose levels, though formal meta-analyses are not yet available. This analysis suggests that fatty acid interventions could yield immune benefits in children in poor settings, especially in non-breastfed children and in relation to inflammatory conditions such as persistent enteropathy. Benefits might include improved responses to enteric vaccines, which frequently perform poorly in low-income settings, and these questions merit randomized trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which may result in nutrition problems that impact on patient health, nutritional status and quality of life. Subjective reports of how IBD patients experience these problems as part of their disease process, including comparisons between patient groups, or the need for tailored nutrition advice as perceived by these patients, have not been widely studied. This survey aimed to identify and explore nutritional problems that are important to CD and UC patients and to investigate their views on the IBD health services provided to help them with these. METHODS: Eighty-seven IBD patients were invited to take part in a nutrition survey using face-to-face questionnaire interviews. The survey asked about food and nutrition problems that patients have experienced, identifying which were most significant and the extent to which they had been addressed by the clinical service. RESULTS: Seventy-two IBD patients completed the evaluation (47 CD, 25 UC). Of these, 45 (62.5%) felt that food and nutrition were either 'important' or 'extremely important' in their experience of IBD, and 59 (82%) reported problems with food and nutrition. Patients with CD and UC reported similar frequencies of most nutritional problems. However, 44 (94%) CD vs. 16 (64%) UC patients reported problems with weight (p=0.002). Less than half of patients had seen a dietitian for tailored nutritional advice to address these problems. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional problems experienced and reported by IBD patients are numerous and varied. They are considered important by patients with CD and UC, both of whom would generally value specific dietary counselling, highlighting a need for further research in this area and adequate and equal provision of services for both groups.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is suspected to be a causative agent in human Crohn's disease (CD). Recent evidence suggests that pathogenic mycobacteria and MAP can induce the expression of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP), which are the main proteases in the pathogenesis of mucosal ulcerations in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Within this study we assessed the prevalence of intestinal MAP specific DNA in patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and healthy controls. We further analysed regulation patterns of MMPs in mucosal tissues of UC patients with and without intestinal MAP DNA detection. METHODS: Colonic biopsy samples were obtained from 63 Norwegian and German IBD patients and 21 healthy controls. RNA was quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to study MMP gene expression in both pathological and healthy mucosal specimens. The presence of MAP DNA in colonic mucosa was examined using MAP specific PCR. RESULTS: MAP DNA was detected in 20% of UC patients and 33% of healthy controls but only in 7% of patients with CD. UC patients treated with corticosteroids exhibited a significantly increased frequency of intestinal MAP DNA compared to those not receiving corticosteroids. Expression of MMP-1, -2, -7, -9, -13, -19, -28 and TNF-alpha did not differ between UC patients with presence of intestinal MAP DNA compared to those without. MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-13 were significantly decreased in UC patients receiving corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of intestinal MAP specific DNA is not associated with altered MMP expression in UC in vivo. Corticosteroids are associated with increased detection of intestinal MAP DNA and decreased expression of certain MMPs. Frequent detection of MAP DNA in healthy controls might be attributable to the wide environmental distribution of MAP and its presence in the food-chain.},

   abstract = {During the last few years a significant advance has been achieved in the understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). From twin studies it was evident that there is more that 50% concordance of Crohn's disease (CD) in monozygotic twin pairs, however it is only 3.6% among dizygotic twins. These data indicate that the genetic background may be responsible for 50% of the risk or 'susceptibility' to develop CD. Obviously it is not a sufficient condition as otherwise there would be 100% concordance of disease in monozygotic twin pairs. Environmental factors as well must play an important role. This is further supported by the fact that there is only low development in genetic risk factors over ten thousands of years. In contrast, the incidence of CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) has dramatically increased in Western countries in the last 100 years. This further supports the concept of a 'Western lifestyle factor(s)' that triggers chronic intestinal inflammation in a genetically susceptible host. The proof of the concept of a genetic susceptibility was achieved in 2001 with the discovery that NOD2 is the most important susceptibility gene for CD. The function of NOD2 has been investigated in detail. NOD2 is an intracellular 'alarm button', a receptor recognizing invading bacteria that entered the mucosal wall. NOD2 mutants associated with susceptibility to CD seem to be deficient in their recognition of bacterial wall products. In a genome-wide association study a disease association was found in the autophagy-related 16-like 1 gene (ATG16L1). The ATG16L1 gene encodes a protein in the autophagosome pathway that processes intracellular bacteria. Based on these findings, CD is now discussed as an impaired and inadequate immune reaction to the gut bacteria which are a part of our environment (or perhaps 'in-vironment'). In addition to NOD2 and ATG16L1, there are more 'innate' pathways by which commensal and pathogenic bacteria can directly interact with cells of the intestinal mucosa. The 'environment concept' and the 'genetic concept' of IBD pathophysiology are converging. With the finding that most susceptibility genes for CD and UC are involved in innate immune mechanisms and the primary defense against bacteria entering the mucosa, for the first time a unifying concept of the 'genetic pathophysiology hypothesis' and the 'environment pathophysiology hypothesis' of IBD was possible. Bacteria are the link between the environment and mucosal defense system.},

   abstract = {Objective. Study the functional results and mucosal changes in the ileal pouch after restorative proctocolectomy with J-reservoir for ulcerative colitis. Material and Methods. Followup study of 125 patients with J-reservoir with one disease-specific- and one general (SF-36) quality of life-questionnaire, rectoscopy with biopsies, and stool samples to evaluate inflammation, dysplasia, presence of Helicobacter pylori and calprotectin level. Results. Fourteen J-reservoirs were removed or deactivated, leaving 111 patients for followup. The followup time was 6.8 (1-15) years. 87.4% of the patients were satisfied. 93.1% had some kind of functional restriction: food- (75.5%), social- (28.9%), physical- (37%) or sexual restriction (15.3%). 18.6% had often or sometimes faecal incontinence. Low daytime faecal frequency was associated with good quality of life. 13 patients (12.6%) had a less favourable result. There was no pouch-dysplasia. Calprotectin levels were increased in patients with visible pouch inflammation or history of pouchitis. HP was diagnosed by RUT in 42.3%, but was not associated with inflammation or pouchitis. Conclusions. Most patients were satisfied with the J-reservoir in spite of a high frequency of various restrictions. 12.6% (13 patients) had a less favourable functional result, partly due to a high frequency of defecations, pain, pouchitis and inflammation.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic inflammatory disorders that can affect the gastrointestinal tract of children and adults. Like other autoimmune processes, the cause(s) of these disorders remain unknown but likely involves some interplay between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. Children, in particular with UC or CD, can present to their primary care providers with similar symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloody stool. Although UC and CD are more predominant in adults, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that a significant percentage of these patients were diagnosed during childhood. The chronic nature of the inflammatory process observed in these children and the waxing and waning nature of their clinical symptoms can be especially disruptive to their physical, social, and academic development. As such, physicians caring for children must consider these diseases when evaluating patients with compatible symptoms. Recent research efforts have made available a variety of more specific and effective pharmacologic agents and improved endoscopic and radiologic assessment tools to assist clinicians in the diagnosis and interval assessment of their patients with IBD; however, as the level of complexity of these interventions has increased, so too has the need for practitioners to become familiar with a wider array of treatments and the risks and benefits of particular diagnostic testing. Nonetheless, in most cases, and especially when frequent visits to subspecialty referral centers are not geographically feasible, primary care providers can be active participants in the management of their pediatric patients with IBD. The goal of this article is to educate and assist pediatricians and adult gastroenterology physicians caring for children with IBD, and in doing so, help to develop more collaborative care plans between primary care and subspecialty providers.},

   abstract = {Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has demonstrated immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory properties in murine experimental ulcerative colitis (UC). In addition to its high monounsaturated fatty acid content, evidences have accumulated on the favorable properties of minor, although highly bioactive, components present in the unsaponifiable fraction (UF). The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of dietary EVOO's UF supplementation on acute UC. C57BL/6 mice were fed from weaning with sunflower oil (SD), EVOO diet and UF-enriched SD at 5% oil (SD+UF). After 30 days, mice were exposed to 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 5 days developing acute colitis. After 4 days of DSS removal, animals were sacrificed and colons were histological and biochemically processed. Disease activity index and microscopic damage score were significantly improved in EVOO and SD+UF dietary groups versus SD group. In addition, both dietary treatments significantly induced decreases in MCP-1 and TNF-alpha levels, iNOS and COX-2 overexpression and p38 MAPKs activation in colon mucosa. Moreover, an upregulation of IkappaB expression was also observed after feeding the animals with both diets. However, no statistically differences between data from mice fed with EVOO or UF+SD diets were observed. Dietary enrichment with EVOO's UF reduces the damage in acute colitis model, alleviating the oxidative events and returning proinflammatory proteins expression to basal levels probably through p38 MAPK and NFkappaB signalling pathways. EVOO's UF diet might provide a basis for developing a new strategy in dietary supplementation for the prevention of UC.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Recent epidemiological studies have shown that habitual consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), the characteristic culinary fat of the Mediterranean area, is effective in the prevention of diverse types of digestive disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. Many of these benefits are, in addition to its high proportion of oleic acid, due to the high content of phenolic compounds. METHODS: Six-week-old mice were randomized into three dietary groups: standard, EVOO and hydroxytyrosol-enriched EVOO. After 30 days, mice that were exposed to 3% DSS for 5 days developed acute colitis that progressed to severe chronic inflammation during a regime of 21 days of water. RESULTS: Diets enriched with EVOO significantly attenuated the clinical and histological signs of damage, improving results from disease activity index and reducing about 50% the mortality caused by DSS. Moreover, hydroxytyrosol supplement showed better results. Cytokines study showed that TNF-alpha was maintained near to sham control and IL-10 levels were significantly improved in EVOO and EVOO plus hydroxytyrosol diet-DSS groups. In the same way, COX-2 and iNOS were downregulated, and the activation of p38 MAPK was reduced. We also observed a higher significant reduction in iNOS in hydroxytyrosol-enriched EVOO compared with EVOO alone. CONCLUSIONS: EVOO diets exerted a noteworthy beneficial effect in chronic DSS-induced colitis by cytokine modulation and COX-2 and iNOS reduction via downregulation of p38 MAPK. In addition to the beneficial effect by EVOO, supplementation of the diet with hydroxytyrosol may improve chronic colitis through iNOS downregulation plus its antioxidant capacity.},

During enterohepatic circulation, the intestinal micro flora cause 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), yielding deoxycholic acid(DCA) and lithocholic acid, respectively. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of probiotics in patients with UC by examining changes of the serum BA profile. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-seven patients were divided into the following 2 groups based on endoscopic findings: Fifteen patients with distal UC (dUC group) and 12 patients with pancolitis (pUC group). After treatment with mesalazine or salazosulfapyridine (5-ASA), all patients achieved remission. Then they were given 5-ASA plus the probiotic Clostridium butyricum Miyairi (3.0 g/day) for 4 weeks. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of probiotic treatment, %CDCA was significantly higher and %DCA was significantly lower in the pUC group than in the HV group. In contrast, the dUC group showed no significant differences of %CDCA or %DCA from the HV group after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic therapy restored intestinal flora involved in 7 alpha-dehydroxylation in the dUC group, but not in the pUC group.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: While probiotic bacteria are successfully used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, the effect of commercially available probiotic products is still controversial. Here, we study whether the number of living probiotic bacteria in yoghurts is altered by an interruption of the cold chain. METHODS: Three commonly available probiotic yoghurts were kept at 4 degrees C or put at room temperature (RT) for 6 h or 24 h. An aliquot of each yoghurt was applied on Man-Rogosa-Sharpe agar and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Colony forming units (CFU) were counted by microscopy. RESULTS: The first yoghurt, containing Lactobacillus johnsonii, showed a significant decrease in CFU after 6 h of storage at RT, which was further pronounced after 24 h. The number of CFU of the second yoghurt, containing Lactobacillus GG, was also decreased after 6 h and further diminished after 24 h at RT. From the third yoghurt, containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, only 53.8% of the CFU remained after 6 h at RT; after 24 h, only about one fourth of the CFU were found. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the number of living probiotic bacteria in yoghurt products decreases dramatically after exposure to RT. This represents an important information for consumers of such products.},

   abstract = {Many foods have been implicated in theories about the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. While evidence has accumulated that nutritional factors as part of overall lifestyle changes may play a role in the growing incidence, no specific dietary recommendations except the promotion of breastfeeding can currently be given to decrease the risk of developing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. For the treatment of Crohn's disease in children and adolescents, however, enteral feeding with a semi-elemental diet seems to be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing and maintaining remission. In the meta-analyses, advantages of one formula over the other are evened out, and more research is warranted into the anti-inflammatory properties of different nutrients, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, butyrate, glutamine, and cytokines, such as transforming growth factors-beta. Unfortunately, for practical reasons, nutritional therapy remains underutilized, even though pediatric patients are most vulnerable to the harmful effects of nutrient deficiencies on growth, pubertal development, and bone health. There is hope that in the future the new field of nutrigenomics may enable physicians to more accurately tailor a specific diet to the patient genotype.},

The authors report a case in which infliximab is surmised to cause NSIP in the absence of other steroid sparing immunosuppressants in a young female with ulcerative colitis. Of importance, the patient was taking no additional steroid sparing immunomodulating agents. The diagnosis was based on clinical presentation and radiologic and histopathological data. Cessation of infliximab and high-dose steroid therapy resulted in complete resolution of the patient's presenting signs and symptoms.},

   abstract = {The probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) is one of the few probiotics licensed as a medication in several countries. Best documented is its effectiveness in keeping patients suffering from ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission. This might be due to its ability to induce the production of human beta-defensin 2 (HBD2) in a flagellin-dependent way in intestinal epithelial cells. In contrast to ulcerative colitis, for Crohn's disease (CD) convincing evidence is lacking that EcN might be clinically effective, most likely due to the genetically based inability of sufficient defensin production in CD patients. As a first step in the development of an alternative approach for the treatment of CD patients, EcN strains were constructed which were able to produce human alpha-defensin 5 (HD5) or beta-defensin 2 (HBD2). For that purpose, codon-optimized defensin genes encoding either the proform with the signal sequence of human alpha-defensin 5 (HD5) or the gene encoding HBD2 with or without the signal sequence were cloned in an expression vector plasmid under the control of the T7 promoter. Synthesis of the encoded defensins was shown by Western blots after induction of expression and lysis of the recombinant EcN strains. Recombinant mature HBD2 with an N-terminal His-tag could be purified by Ni-column chromatography and showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes. In a second approach, that part of the HBD2 gene which encodes mature HBD2 was fused with the yebF gene. The resulting fusion protein YebFMHBD2 was secreted from the encoding EcN mutant strain after induction of expression. Presence of YebFMHBD2 in the medium was not the result of leakage from the bacterial cells, as demonstrated in the spent culture supernatant by Western blots specific for beta-galactosidase and maltose-binding protein. The dialyzed and concentrated culture supernatant inhibited the growth of E. coli, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and L. monocytogenes in radial diffusion assays as well as in liquid culture. This demonstrates EcN to be a suitable probiotic E. coli strain for the production of certain defensins.},

Various nutrients were found to be involved, sometimes with controversial results, possibly pertaining to geographic regions. Nutrition has to be especially considered in children as disease itself and/or the medication can severely impair normal growth and development, sometimes with permanent long-term sequels. We reviewed the data on the possible roles of diet in preventing the disease and relapses.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) mediate pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation. We characterized the role of the gelatinase (GelE), a metalloprotease from Enterococcus faecalis, in the development of colitis in mice. METHODS: Germ-free, interleukin-10-deficient (IL-10(-/-)) mice were monoassociated with the colitogenic E faecalis strain OG1RF and isogenic, GelE-mutant strains. Barrier function was determined by measuring E-cadherin expression, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), and translocation of permeability markers in colonic epithelial cells and colon segments from IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice. GelE specificity was shown with the MMP inhibitor marimastat. RESULTS: Histologic analysis (score 0-4) of E faecalis monoassociated IL-10(-/-) mice revealed a significant reduction in colonic tissue inflammation in the absence of bacteria-derived GelE. We identified cleavage sites for GelE in the sequence of recombinant mouse E-cadherin, indicating that it might be degraded by GelE. Experiments with Ussing chambers and purified GelE revealed the loss of barrier function and extracellular E-cadherin in mice susceptible to intestinal inflammation (IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice) before inflammation developed. Colonic epithelial cells had reduced TER and increased translocation of permeability markers after stimulation with GelE from OG1RF or strains of E faecalis isolated from patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: The metalloprotease GelE, produced by commensal strains of E faecalis, contributes to development of chronic intestinal inflammation in mice that are susceptible to intestinal inflammation (IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice) by impairing epithelial barrier integrity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease, a chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, presents in two variations, Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Given that treatment of CD differs from UC, a single test that provided strong diagnostic ability would offer great clinical value. Two previous studies have indicated that CD can be distinguished from UC, and that both can be distinguished from non-IBD-type gastrointestinal disease, based on urinary and faecal metabolite profiling. METHODS: Analysis of healthy as well as CD and UC patients attending an IBD clinic was performed. IBD patients were classified into two groups (CD or UC) based on chart review of clinical, endoscopic, and histological assessment. Urine samples were obtained and analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with targeted profiling techniques, followed by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. RESULTS: Based on urinary metabolomics, individuals with IBD could be differentiated from healthy. Major differences between IBD and healthy included TCA cycle intermediates, amino acids, and gut microflora metabolites. Comparison of CD and UC patients revealed discrimination, but removal of patients with the surgical intervention confounder revealed that CD could not be discriminated from UC. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential for metabolomics to distinguish IBD from the healthy state but shows that careful consideration must be given to establishing disease-representative cohorts that are free of confounding factors.},

   abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway has an important role in the regulation of inflammatory responses. Most recently, we have shown that the activation of the AhR pathway by a potent AhR agonist inhibits the development of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, a model of human ulcerative colitis, by the induction of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the large intestine. Because several strains of probiotic lactic acid bacteria have been reported to inhibit DSS-induced colitis by unidentified mechanisms, we hypothesized that particular strains of lactic acid bacterium might have the potential to activate the AhR pathway, thereby inhibiting DSS-induced colitis. This study investigated whether there are specific lactic acid bacterial strains that can activate the AhR pathway, and if so, whether this AhR-activating potential is associated with suppression of DSS-induced colitis. By using AhR signaling reporter cells, we found that Lactobacillus bulgaricus OLL1181 had the potential to activate the AhR pathway. OLL1181 also induced the mRNA expression of cytochrome P450 family 1A1 (CYP1A1), a target gene of the AhR pathway, in human colon cells, which was inhibited by the addition of an AhR antagonist, alpha-naphthoflavon (alphaNF). In addition, mice treated orally with OLL1181 showed an increase in CYP1A1 mRNA expression in the large intestine and amelioration of DSS-induced colitis. Thus, OLL1181 can induce activation of the intestinal AhR pathway and inhibit DSS-induced colitis in mice. This strain of lactic acid bacterium has therefore the potential to activate the AhR pathway, which may be able to suppress colitis.},

An extract of the herb, HMPL-004, inhibits TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, and prevents colitis in animal models. AIM: To determine the efficacy and safety of HMPL-004 in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, multicentre, 8-week parallel group study was conducted using HMPL-004 1200 mg/day compared with 4500 mg/day of slow release mesalazine (mesalamine) granules in patients with mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis. Disease activity was assessed at baseline and every 2 weeks for clinical response, and at baseline and 8 weeks by colonoscopy. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients at five centres in China were randomised and dosed. Clinical remission and response were seen in 21% and 76% of HMPL-004-treated patients, and 16% and 82% of mesalazine-treated patients. By colonoscopy, remission and response were seen in 28% and 74% of HMPL-004-treated patients and 24% and 71% of mesalazine-treated patients, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: HMPL-004 may be an efficacious alternative to mesalazine in ulcerative colitis.},

To identify published studies, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, The Cochrane Library, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 2009 (January) to 2011 (October). We also searched the US Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research website for additional unpublished data, requested dossiers of information from pharmaceutical manufacturers, and retrieved relevant citations from reference lists of included studies. Study selection, data abstraction, validity assessment, grading the strength of the evidence, and data synthesis were all carried out according to our standard review methods. Overall, targeted immune modulators are highly effective medications for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and plaque psoriasis that substantially improve the burden of disease and are generally safe for short-term treatment. For rheumatoid arthritis, low-and moderate-strength evidence indicated that some targeted immune modulators are more efficacious than others. These results were based on three head-to-head trials, several large observational studies, and indirect comparisons of placebo-controlled trials. The evidence is currently insufficient to reliably determine the comparative effectiveness for other indications and in subgroups. Low-strength evidence indicated that serious infections are less common with abatacept than the other drugs and that the rate of adverse events is greater with infliximab than adalimumab or etanercept. Likewise, more patients receiving infliximab withdrew due to adverse events than abatacept, adalimumab, etanercept, and golimumab. Infusion or allergic reactions contributed to the difference in risk.},

   abstract = {Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb) is a probiotic yeast that has demonstrated efficacy in pilot studies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Microbial antigen handling by dendritic cells (DC) is believed to be of critical importance for immunity and tolerance in IBD. The aim was to characterize the effects of Sb on DC from IBD patients. Highly purified (>95%), lipopolysaccharide-stimulated CD1c(+)CD11c(+)CD123(-) myeloid DC (mDC) from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 36), Crohn's disease (CD; n = 26), or infectious controls (IC; n = 4) were cultured in the presence or absence of fungal supernatant from Sb (SbS). Phenotype and cytokine production and/or secretion of IBD mDC were measured by flow cytometry and cytometric bead arrays, respectively. T cell phenotype and proliferation were assessed in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) with allogenic CD4(+)CD45RA(+) naive T cells from healthy donors. Mucosal healing was investigated in epithelial wounding and migration assays with IEC-6 cells. SbS significantly decreased the frequency of CD40-, CD80-, and CD197 (CCR7; chemokine receptor-7)-expressing IBD mDC and reduced their secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 while increasing IL-8. In the MLR, SbS significantly inhibited T cell proliferation induced by IBD mDC. Moreover, SbS inhibited T(H)1 (TNF-alpha and interferon-gamma) polarization induced by UC mDC and promoted IL-8 and transforming growth factor-beta-dependent mucosal healing. In summary, we provide novel evidence of synergistic mechanisms how Sb controls inflammation (inhibition of T cell costimulation and inflammation-associated migration and mobilization of DC) and promotes epithelial restitution relevant in IBD.},

   abstract = {The gut of a healthy adult harbours a myriad of different microbial species. It is estimated that approximately 10 14 are present in total bacterial colony forming units (CFU). Each colony colonizes a specific intestinal tract. In healthy adult, the main control of intestinal bacterial colonization occurs through gastric acidity but also other factors can influence the intestinal microenvironment such as pH, temperature, competition among different bacterial strains, peristalsis, drugs, radiotherapy and much more. Impaired microbial homeostasis leads to an alteration of the permeability of tissue, together with the activation of the intestinal immune system MALT (mucosal associated lymphoid tissue). In this regard we discuss the increasing experimental evidences of the role of commensal microbiota in the activation of specific intestinal immunocompetent cells. The aforementioned micro-environmental changes provide the substrate for the etiopathogenetic outbreak of numerous pathologies of gastro-intestinal tract, such as intestinal chronic inflammation (Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis), together with a miscellany of extra intestinal disorders. This article is an overview of the latest scientific findings about the close causal relationship between intestinal microbial flora and inflammatory bowel diseases or other extra-intestinal diseases; it is also mentioned the possible relationship between mycobacteria and Chron's disease. Finally we analyse the beneficial role of probiotics.},

   abstract = {In an earlier work, the role of heat shock protein (Hsp60) in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) was suggested by its significant increase in the pathological mucosa parallel with an increase in inflammatory cells. More data in this direction are reported in this work. We analyzed by immunohistochemistry biopsies of colon tissue from 2 groups of patients with UC and treated with either 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) alone or in combination with a probiotic. We looked for inflammatory markers and Hsp60. Both the treatments were effective in reducing symptoms but the group treated with both 5-ASA and probiotics showed better clinical results. Amelioration of symptoms was associated with reduction of both inflammation and Hsp60, a reduction that was most marked in the group treated with 5-ASA and probiotics. The levels of Hsp60 positively correlated with those of CD68-positive cells, and double immunofluorescence showed a high index of colocalization of the chaperonin and CD68 in lamina propria. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that Hsp60-classically a mitochondrial protein-was abundantly also present in cytosol in biopsies taken at the time of diagnosis, but not after the treatment. Our data suggest that Hsp60 is an active player in pathogenesis of UC and it can be hypothesized that the chaperonin is responsible, at least in part, for initiation and maintenance of disease.},

   abstract = {Pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) has a more severe phenotype, reflected by more extensive disease and a higher rate of acute severe exacerbations. The pooled steroid-failure rate among 291 children from five studies is 34% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27%-41%). It is suggested that corticosteroids should be dosed between 1-1.5 mg/kg up to 40-60 mg daily. Food restriction has a limited role in severe UC and should be generally discouraged in children who do not have a surgical abdomen. Appraisal of radiologic findings in children must recognize the variation in colonic width with age and size. Data suggest that the Pediatric UC Activity Index (PUCAI), determined at day 3, should be used to screen for patients likely to fail corticosteroids (>45 points), and at day 5 to dictate the introduction of second-line therapy (>65-70 points). Cyclosporine is successful in children with severe colitis but its use should be restricted to 3-4 months while bridging to thiopurine treatment (pooled short-term success rate 81% [95% CI: 76%-86%]; n = 94 from eight studies). Infliximab may be as effective as cyclosporine (75% pooled short-term response (95% CI: 67%-83%); n = 126, six studies) with a pooled 1-year response of 64% (95% CI: 56%-72%). In toxic megacolon, in patients refractory to one salvage medical therapy, and in chronic severe disease, colectomy may be preferred. Decision-making regarding colectomy in children must consider the toxicity of medication consumed over many future years, the quality of life and self-image associated with either choice, as well as both functional outcomes and, in females, fertility following pouch procedures.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression may be increased in segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis (SCAD). Our aim was to assess TNF-alpha expression in SCAD in relationship to the treatment. METHODS: 10 patients affected by severe (type B and D) SCAD were studied (6 males, 4 females, mean age 60.54 years, range 43-85 years). All patients were treated with beclomethasone dipropionate 10 mg/day plus a probiotic preparation VSL#3 for 8 weeks. At that time, clinical, endoscopic and histological reassessment was performed. Controls were 5 patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC). RESULTS: After treatment, all SCAD B and no SCAD D patients were in remission. The TNF-alpha expression dropped from 42.7% (+/-7.58) to 15.7% (+/-2.6) in SCAD B patients (p=0.001), and from 40% (+/-5.9) to 28.6% (+/-5.3) in SCAD D patients (p=0.005). In UC patients, the TNF-alpha expression dropped from 45.5% (+/-5.09) to 22.5% (+/-2.5) (p=0.001). Neither SCAD B nor SCAD D patients showed a significant difference in TNF-alpha expression compared to UC after treatment. Finally, TNF-alpha was significantly overexpressed in SCAD D than in SCAD B at the end of treatment (p=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: TNF-alpha expression in SCAD down regulates after treatment, and seems to be related to the clinical response to therapy. This behaviour, similar to that of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), confirms that this disease should be considered as a subtype of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to longitudinally study serum homocysteine levels in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in relation to disease activity and B vitamin status. METHODS: In all, 98 consecutive adult patients (age 25-55 years) with CD (n = 70) and UC (n = 28) were enrolled and assessed at three timepoints over 1 year. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in levels of homocysteine, B vitamins, or dietary intake by disease type, disease activity, or across visits. 13% of all inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients had elevated homocysteine at least once during the study. Nine patients with CD had fluctuating homocysteine levels during the study but these were inconsistent, ranging from within normal range to elevated levels in any individual. Six of these nine patients were persistently in remission. 30% of all IBD patients had vitamin B6 deficiency, 11% had vitamin B12 deficiency, and one patient (CD) had folate deficiency. All vitamins showed a significant correlation between intake and serum levels (B6; r = 0.46, P < 0.001, B12; r = 0.42, P < 0.001, and folate; r = 0.26, P = 0.008). There was an inverse relationship between serum homocysteine in the blood and serum vitamin B12 (r = -0.241, P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Serum homocysteine was mostly normal in patients with IBD and changed minimally over time. There was no association between disease activity and elevation of serum homocysteine. 30% of patients have vitamin B6 deficiency but vitamin B6 is not associated with elevated homocysteine. The routine measurement of homocysteine is not warranted.},

METHODS: The iterative process included multiphase qualitative methods. A literature review of GI disorders was conducted to generate domains for the focus interviews. Six pediatric gastroenterologists with extensive clinical experience in GI disorders provided expert opinion regarding the conceptual framework. A total of 98 participants, 46 pediatric patients ages 5 to 18, and 52 parents of patients ages 2 to 18 with physician-diagnosed GI disorders (chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease [Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis], gastroesophageal reflux disease), participated in the focus interviews and cognitive interviewing phases, including think-aloud and cognitive debriefing protocols. RESULTS: Eleven domains were derived from the qualitative methods involving patient and parent interviews and expert opinion, with content saturation achieved, resulting in 76 items. The 11 domains consisted of items measuring stomach pain, stomach upset, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, gas and bloating, constipation, diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative methods involving pediatric patients and their parents in the item generation process support the content validity for the new PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module. The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module is undergoing national multisite field testing as the next iterative phase.},

With recent evidence implicating a disruption in the balance of the gastrointestinal microbiome and intestinal immunity as a potential trigger for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there has been growing interest in using probiotics as an adjunct to standard anti-inflammatory and immune suppressing therapy. Animal models describe potential and plausible mechanisms of action for probiotics to counter inflammation of colonic mucosa. Although there are insufficient data to recommend probiotics in ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, good evidence supports the use of specific probiotics for maintenance of remission in pouchitis. Although there are limited regulatory standards for the agents, probiotics are relatively safe with minimal reported side effects or contraindications. More rigorous studies need to be published supporting efficacy and safety of these agents before they become a mainstay of IBD medical treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is used to describe a state of idiopathic, chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The two main phenotypes of IBD are Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The major cause of IBD-associated mortality is colorectal cancer. Although both host-genetic and exogenous factors have been found to be involved, the aetiology of IBD is still not well understood. In this study we characterized thirteen Escherichia coli strains from patients with IBD by comparative genomic hybridization employing a microarray based on 31 sequenced E. coli genomes from a wide range of commensal and pathogenic isolates. RESULTS: The IBD isolates, obtained from patients with UC and CD, displayed remarkably heterogeneous genomic profiles with little or no evidence of group-specific determinants. No IBD-specific genes were evident when compared with the prototypic CD isolate, LF82, suggesting that the IBD-inducing effect of the strains is multifactorial. Several of the IBD isolates carried a number of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC)-related virulence determinants such as the pap, sfa, cdt and hly genes. The isolates were also found to carry genes of ExPEC-associated genomic islands. CONCLUSIONS: Combined, these data suggest that E. coli isolates obtained from UC and CD patients represents a heterogeneous population of strains, with genomic profiles that are indistinguishable to those of ExPEC isolates. Our findings indicate that IBD-induction from E. coli strains is multifactorial and that a range of gene products may be involved in triggering the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: High-fat diets have been shown to be a risk factor for ulcerative colitis (UC). Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are considered to increase lipid peroxidation, while the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid exerts a chemopreventative effect. We evaluated the effect of high-fat diets (20%) enriched with fish or soybean oil on colonic inflammation and DNA damage in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (28-30 days) were fed an American Institute of Nutrition (AIN)-93 diet for 47 days and divided into five groups: control normal fat non-colitic (C) or control colitis (CC), high soybean fat group (HS) colitis, high fish fat group colitis, or high-fat soybean plus fish oil colitis. UC was induced from day 35 until day 41 by 3% dextran sulfate sodium. On day 47, the rats were anesthetized; blood samples collected for corticosterone determination, and the distal colon was excised to quantify interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-10, and interferon-gamma levels, myeloperoxidase activity, histological analyses, and DNA damage. The disease activity index was recorded daily. RESULTS: The disease activity index, histological analysis, myeloperoxidase activity, IL-4, interferon-gamma, and corticosterone levels did not differ among the colitic groups. IL-10 was significantly increased by the high fish fat group diet in relation to HS, but only the high soybean-fish fat diet increased the IL-10/IL-4 ratio (anti-inflammatory/pro-inflammatory) to levels closer to the C group and reduced DNA damage compared to the HS group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The data show that high-fat diets did not exacerbate UC and suggest that the soybean and fish oil mixture, more than the fish oil alone, could be a complementary therapy to achieve a cytokine balance in UC.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the faecal microbiota in patients either with UC in remission (n=6) or with active disease (n=6), and in healthy controls (n=6). The composition of Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria was examined. Antigenic structures of Gram-negative bacteria such as lipopolysaccharides have been related to the inflammatory responses and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Dice cluster analysis and principal component analysis of faecal microbiota profiles obtained by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative PCR, respectively, revealed that the composition of faecal bacteria from UC patients with active disease differed from the healthy controls and that this difference should be ascribed to Gram-negative bacteria. The analysis did not show any clear grouping of UC patients in remission. Even with the relatively low number of subjects in each group, we were able to detect a statistically significant underrepresentation of Lactobacillus spp. and Akkermansia muciniphila in UC patients with clinically active disease compared to the healthy controls. In line with previous communications, we have shown that the microbiota in UC patients with active disease differ from that in healthy controls. Our findings indicate that alterations in the composition of the Gram-negative bacterial population, as well as reduced numbers of lactobacilli and A. muciniphila may play a role in UC.},

These results were compared to those for fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), which are known to have a prebiotic effect. Fermentation studies were carried out using a small-scale static batch system, and changes in the fecal microbial communities and metabolites were monitored after 24 h by quantitative real-time PCR and short-chain fatty acid analysis. With a few minor exceptions, AOS affected the communities similarly to what was seen for FOS. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. were selectively increased after fermentation of AOS or FOS by fecal microbiota derived from UC patients. The stimulation of growth of Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. was accompanied by a high production of acetate and hence a decrease of pH. The fermentation of AOS may help improve the inflammatory conditions in UC patients through stimulation of bacteria eliciting anti-inflammatory responses and through production of acetate. AOS may therefore represent a new prebiotic candidate for reduction of the risk of flare-ups in UC patients. However, human trials are needed to confirm a health-promoting effect.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the current literature concerning the medical treatment of acute and chronic pouchitis. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched (both 1965-February 2011) using the following terms: pouchitis, Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment. Bibliographies from key articles were also searched, and all pertinent articles were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All available primary literature published in English on treatment for pouchitis was considered, with controlled trials receiving highest priority. DATA SYNTHESIS: Pouchitis occurs in up to 50% of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) patients with inflammatory bowel disease within 10 years of the procedure. Symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, and fecal incontinence with frequent diarrhea. The diagnosis of pouchitis is usually made based on symptoms as well as endoscopic and histologic findings. Treatment of acute pouchitis includes antimicrobials such as ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and rifaximin. If these fail, limited data suggest that oral budesonide, mesalamine, or infliximab may be effective treatments. Surgical revision may be necessary if medical treatments fail. Emerging evidence suggests that the probiotic compound VSL#3 may be effective in preventing the recurrence of pouchitis. CONCLUSIONS: Pouchitis is a common complication of IPAA surgery. The strongest data suggest that antimicrobial therapy is an effective first-line treatment for acute pouchitis, and VSL#3 may be effective for prevention of recurrence.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: We aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of Peifeikang, a probiotics compound, on colitis in rats induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and to elucidate its potential mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated the therapeutic effects of Peifeikang by analysis of the disease activity index, colonic mucosa damage index, and histopathological score of the inflamed colons, by measurement of colonic myeloperoxidase activity through spectrophotometric assay, by determination of colonic positivities of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-10 via immunochemical staining, and by detection of serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-10 with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid caused colonic inflammation similar to human ulcerative colitis with significantly increased disease activity index, colonic mucosa damage index, histopathological score, and colonic myeloperoxidase activities (p<0.05). After treatment with Peifeikang or olsalazine alone, or both, disease activity index, colonic mucosa damage index, histopathological score, and colonic myeloperoxidase activities decreased significantly (p<0.05). The relief of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis was accompanied by significantly decreased production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in both serum and intra-colon (p<0.05) and by significantly increased production of interleukin-10 in both serum and intra-colon (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Peifeikang can effectively ameliorate trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis in rats, the underlying mechanism of which may be attributed to the modulatory effects of Peifeikang on the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-10.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effects of proanthocyanidins from grape seeds (GSPE) on recurrent ulcerative colitis (UC) in rats. GSPE in doses of 100, 200, and 400mg/kg were intragastrically administered per day for 7 days after recurrent colitis was twice-induced by TNBS. The levels of GSH, as well as the activity of GSH-Px and SOD in colon tissues were measured by biochemical methods. The expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and the nuclear translocation levels of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) in the colon tissues were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. Western blotting analysis was used to determine the protein expression levels of inhibitory kappa B-alpha (IkappaBalpha), inhibitor kappa B kinase (IKKalpha/beta), phosphorylated IkappaBalpha and phosphorylated IKKalpha/beta. GSPE treatment was associated with a remarkable increased the activity of GSH-Px and SOD with GSH levels in TNBS-induced recurrent colitis rats as compared to the model group. GSPE also significantly reduced the expression levels of TNF-alpha, p-IKKalpha/beta, p-IkappaBalpha and the translocation of NF-kappaB in the colon mucosa. GSPE exerted a protective effect on recurrent colitis in rats by modifying the inflammatory response and promoting damaged tissue repair to improve colonic oxidative stress. Moreover, GSPE inhibited the TNBS-induced inflammatory of recurrent colitis though blocking NF-kappaB signaling pathways.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective method of treatment in achieving remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. The objective of our study was to assess the influence of EEN on serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) in children and adolescents with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine children and adolescents with IBD (24 with Crohn disease [CD] and 15 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 25 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. VEGF and TGF-beta1 were assessed at the baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of EEN in CD and UC groups and once in controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immunoassays. RESULTS: At the baseline, we found increased serum VEGF in the CD versus UC group and controls (P < 0.05) and serum TGF-beta1 in the UC versus CD group and controls (P < 0.05). During EEN, VEGF decreased in the UC and CD groups, whereas TGF-beta1 increased in the CD group and decreased in the UC group. The CD group achieved disease remission faster than the UC group, and the weight gain of patients with CD during EEN was higher compared with patients with UC. Additionally, TGF-beta1 concentration correlated with protein and energies daily intake in the CD group (R = 0.95; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different effectiveness of EEN in achieving remission in CD and UC may result from a modification of growth factor production. EEN stimulated TGF-beta1 production in CD but not in UC, which possibly resulted in higher effectiveness of EEN in this group of patients.},

The SenseWearPro(2) armband allows to measure physical activity under everyday life conditions. METHODS: Thirty-nine IBD patients (27 Crohn's disease, 12 ulcerative colitis, 24 boys) in remission (n=26) or with only mild disease activity (n=13) were compared to 39 healthy age and sex-matched controls. Body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), lean body mass as phase angle alpha (determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis), and dynamometric grip force were expressed as age- and sex-related Z-scores. SenseWearPro(2) armbands were applied for three consecutive days to record number of steps, duration of physical activity and sleeping time. Quality of life was assessed with the German KINDL and IMPACT III questionnaires, energy intake with prospective food protocols. Differences between patients and pair-matched controls were analysed by paired t-test. RESULTS: Patients showed lower Z-scores for phase angle alpha (difference -0.72; 95% CI [-1.10; -0.34]) and lower grip strength (-1.02 [-1.58; -0.47]) than controls. They tended towards lesser number of steps per day (-1339 [-2760; 83]) and shorter duration of physical activity (-0.44 h [-0.94; 0.06]), particularly in females and patients with mild disease. Quality of life and energy intake did not differ between patients and controls. CONCLUSION: In spite of quiescent disease lean body mass and physical activity were reduced. Interventions to encourage physical activity may be beneficial in this lifelong disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To investigate the clinical effect of treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (Probio-Tec AB-25) to maintain remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis in remission - including proctitis and at least one relapse within the last year were randomised (2:1) in a double-blind placebo-controlled study to Probio-Tec AB-25 or placebo for 52 weeks. The patients were evaluated clinically, endoscopically and histologically at entry and if relapsing. No other medication for ulcerative colitis than the study drug was allowed during the study. Primary endpoint was maintenance of clinical remission, secondary endpoints comparisons of days to relapse, and safety and tolerability of the study drug. The concentrations of the probiotic bacterial strains in stool were analysed in a subset of patients. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were randomised. Twenty patients received Probio-Tec AB-25 and twelve patients received placebo. Five patients (25%) in the Probio-Tec AB-25 group and one patient (8%) in the placebo group maintained remission after 1 year of treatment (p=0.37). The median time to relapse was 125.5days (range 11-391 days) in the probiotic group and 104 days (range 28-369 days) in the placebo group respectively, (p=0.683). Probio-Tec AB-25 was overall well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In this small randomised placebo-controlled trial no significant clinical benefit of Probio-Tec AB-25 could be demonstrated in comparison with placebo for maintaining remission in patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis. A difference may be achieved in larger studies, but the clinical significance of this would be questionable. This study was registered in ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT00268164).},

   abstract = {It is generally accepted that carbohydrate fermentation results in beneficial effects for the host because of the generation of short chain fatty acids, whereas protein fermentation is considered detrimental for the host's health. Protein fermentation mainly occurs in the distal colon, when carbohydrates get depleted and results in the production of potentially toxic metabolites such as ammonia, amines, phenols and sulfides. However, the effectivity of these metabolites has been established mainly in in vitro studies. In addition, some important bowel diseases such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and ulcerative colitis appear most often in the distal colon, which is the primary site of protein fermentation. Finally, epidemiological studies revealed that diets rich in meat are associated with the prevalence of CRC, as is the case in Western society. Importantly, meat intake not only increases fermentation of proteins but also induces increased intake of fat, heme and heterocyclic amines, which may also play a role in the development of CRC. Despite these indications, the relationship between gut health and protein fermentation has not been thoroughly investigated. In this review, the existing evidence about the potential toxicity of protein fermentation from in vitro animal and human studies will be summarized.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Intrarectal administration of mouse cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (mCRAMP) reduced intestinal inflammation in mice. In the current study, we examined whether mCRAMP-transformed Lactococcus lactis given orally attained similar protective effects. METHOD: mCRAMP was produced and secreted from the transformed L. lactis. Murine colitis was induced by ingestion of 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7 days. Eight or 10 log colony forming unit (cfu) L. lactis or the transformed strains with or without nisin induction were given orally as a parallel treatment with DSS. The body weight, fecal microbiota populations, clinical symptoms and histological examinations of colonic tissues were determined. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) level were also evaluated to reflect the degree of inflammation. A prototype anti-inflammatory drug sulfasalazine was used as a reference drug to compare the efficacy and mechanisms of action for ulcerative colitis (UC). RESULT: Compared with the control group with colitis, cathelicidin-transformed L. lactis could improve the clinical symptoms, maintain crypt integrity and preserve mucus content (P < 0.01). The number of apoptotic cells, MPO activity and MDA level were also significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The increases of fecal microbiota in colitis animals were markedly prevented (P < 0.001). Unlike mCRAMP-encoding L. lactis, effective doses of sulfasalazine only alleviated the clinical symptoms (P < 0.01) but not the mucosal damage in the colon. CONCLUSION: mCRAMP-transformed L. lactis has been shown to produce mCRAMP, effectively preventing murine UC. Oral administration of this biological preparation is better than sulfasalazine for the treatment of UC.},

   abstract = {Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) plays an important role in maintaining intestinal barrier homeostasis and accelerating intestinal restitution. However, studies of MFG-E8 expression in humans with ulcerative colitis are lacking. We examined MFG-E8 expression in colonic mucosal biopsies from ulcerative colitis patients and healthy controls (n = 26 each) by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. MFG-E8 mRNA and protein expression was lower in ulcerative colitis patients than in controls. MFG-E8 expression was inversely correlated with mucosal inflammatory activity and clinical disease activity in patients. MFG-E8 was present in human intestinal epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. Apoptosis induction was also detected in the intestinal epithelium of ulcerative colitis patients by terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick-end labeling assay. We used lentiviral vectors encoding human MFG-E8 targeting short hairpin RNA to obtain MFG-E8 knockdown intestinal epithelia cell clones. MFG-E8 knockdown could promote apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cell lines, accompanied by a decrease in level of the antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and induction of the proapoptotic protein BCL2-associated protein X (BAX). The addition of recombinant human MFG-E8 led to decreased BAX and cleaved caspase-3 levels and induction of BCL-2 level in intestinal epithelia cells. MFG-E8 knockdown also attenuated wound healing on scratch assay of intestinal epithelial cells. The mRNA level of intestinal trefoid factor 3, a pivotal factor in intestinal epithelial cell migration and restitution, was downregulated with MFG-E8 knockdown. In conclusion, we demonstrated that decreased colonic MFG-E8 expression in patients with ulcerative colitis may be associated with mucosal inflammatory activity and clinical disease activity through basal cell apoptosis and preventing tissue healing in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {The human gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex and abundant microbial community reaching as high as 10(13)-10(14) microorganisms in the colon. This endogenous microbiota forms a symbiotic relationship with their eukaryotic host and this close partnership helps maintain homeostasis by performing essential and non-redundant tasks (e.g. nutrition/energy and, immune system balance, pathogen exclusion). Although this relationship is essential and beneficial to the host, various events (e.g. infection, diet, stress, inflammation) may impact microbial composition, leading to the formation of a dysbiotic microbiota, further impacting on health and disease states. For example, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively termed inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), have been associated with the establishment of a dysbiotic microbiota. In addition, extra-intestinal disorders such as obesity and metabolic syndrome are also associated with the development of a dysbiotic microbiota. Consequently, there is an increasing interest in harnessing the power of the microbiome and modulating its composition as a means to alleviate intestinal pathologies/disorders and maintain health status. In this review, we will discuss the emerging relationship between the microbiota and development of colorectal cancer as well as present evidence that microbial manipulation (probiotic, prebiotic) impacts disease development.},
