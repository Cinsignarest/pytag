   abstract = {Although the intracellular Cl(-)/H(+) exchanger Clc-5 is expressed in apical intestinal endocytic compartments, its pathophysiological role in the gastrointestinal tract is unknown. In light of recent findings that CLC-5 is downregulated in active ulcerative colitis (UC), we tested the hypothesis that loss of CLC-5 modulates the immune response, thereby inducing susceptibility to UC. Acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis was induced in Clcn5 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. Colitis, monitored by disease activity index, histological activity index, and myeloperoxidase activity were significantly elevated in DSS-induced Clcn5 KO mice compared with those in WT mice. Comprehensive serum multiplex cytokine profiling demonstrated a heightened Th1-Th17 profile (increased TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-17) in DSS-induced Clcn5 KO mice compared with that in WT DSS colitis mice. Interestingly, Clcn5 KO mice maintained on a high vitamin D diet attenuated DSS-induced colitis. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses of colonic mucosa validated the systemic cytokine patterns and further revealed enhanced activation of the NF-kappaB pathway in DSS-induced Clcn5 KO mice compared with those in WT mice. Intriguingly, high baseline levels of IL-6 and phospho-IkappaB were observed in Clcn5 KO mice, suggesting a novel immunopathogenic role for the functional defects that result from the loss of Clc-5. Our studies demonstrate that the loss of Clc-5 1) exhibits IL-6-mediated immunopathogenesis, 2) significantly exacerbated DSS-induced colitis, which is influenced by dietary factors, including vitamin D, and 3) portrays distinct NF-kappaB-modulated Th1-Th17 immune dysregulation, implying a role for CLC-5 in the immunopathogenesis of UC.},

The enzyme is significantly decreased in ulcerative colitis and colon cancer. Based on this information, we wanted to investigate whether the enzyme had preventive effects against murine colitis. We report herein a method to express a biologically active Alk-SMase from Pichia pastoris yeast cells. By using the expressed enzyme to treat a rat colitis model induced by dextran sulfate sodium, we found that intrarectal instillation of Alk-SMase once daily for 1 week significantly reduced the inflammation score and protected the colonic epithelium from inflammatory destruction. We found a tendency for decreased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha expression in the Alk-SMase-treated group. This study, for the first time, provides a method to produce the enzyme and shows the potential applicability of the enzyme in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {The pathogenic mechanisms responsible for inflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcerative colitis (UC), are poorly understood. In animal models, the oral administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induces colitis, which exhibits several clinical and histological features similar to UC. In addition, the longstanding administration of DSS also induces colon cancer. However, the pathogenic factors responsible for DSS-induced colitis and the subsequent colon cancer also remain unclear. In particular, there are only limited data concerning colonic epithelia cell apoptosis and proliferation in DSS-induced colitis. Therefore, we investigated the relationships between these factors. Colitis was induced in BALB/cA Jcl mice by 8 days of oral administration of standard diets containing 5% (w/w of diet) DSS. The control mice received the standard diets only. Morphological changes in the colonic mucosa were evaluated and scored by light microscopy. Apoptosis was studied by the TUNEL assay, and cell proliferation by Ki-67 immunoreactivity. The macroscopic findings showed the most severe inflammation in the distal colon. Epithelial apoptosis increased approximately 5-fold after DSS administration as compared to the controls. On the other hand, the mitotic cells decreased about half-fold as compared to the controls. Ki-67 immunohistochemistry showed that cells with cell cycle arrest at the G0 stage in the crypt increased approximately 2-fold as compared to the controls. In conclusion, the increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation might lead to a breakdown of the epithelial barrier function, and thus facilitate the mucosal invasion of intraluminal microorganisms in DSS-induced colitis.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease is an entity with not wellknown pathogenesis, and important nutritional and metabolic implications because of the high prevalence of malnutrition, the possible implication of dietary factors in its pathogenesis and because of the hypothesis that nutritional intervention could be a primary treatment for the disease. Some nutrients could induce a low antigenic stimuli, regulate inflammatory and immunological responses and stimulate intestinal mucosal trophism. Present available evidence supports enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease as a primary treatment if treatment with steroids is not possible (failure or contraindication) (grade of recommendation A) or either combined treatment with drugs in malnourished patients or those with inflammatory bowel stenosis. In those patients with sustained clinical remission, no benefit of either enteral nutrition or supplements in the absence of nutritional deficits has been shown. Elemental or modified formula (glutamine, omega 3 fatty acids) could not be recommended. In ulcerative colitis, nutritional influence over the activity of the disease has not been shown, although there are some promising results regarding enteric coated W3 fatty acids and a possible role for probiotics. In the treatment and prevention of pouchitis, there could be a role for probiotics (VSL#3). Nutritional treatment should be considered an integral component in the Management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex and probably multifactorial. Nutrition has been proposed to be an important aetiological factor for development of IBD. Several components of the diet (such as sugar, fat, fibre, fruit and vegetable, protein, fast food, preservatives etc.) were examined as possible causative agents for IBD. According to some researchers infant feeding (breast feeding) may also contribute to the development of IBD. Though the importance of environmental factors is evidenced by the increasing incidence in developed countries and in migrant population in recent decades, the aetiology of IBD remained unclear. There are many theories, but as yet no dietary approaches have been proved to reduce the risk of developing IBD. The role of nutrition in the management of IBD is better understood. The prevention and correction of malnutrition, the provision of macro- and micronutrients and vitamins and the promotion of optimal growth and development of children are key points of nutritional therapy. In active disease, the effective support of energy and nutrients is a very important part of the therapy. Natural and artificial nutrition or the combination of two can be chosen for supporting therapy of IBD. The author summarises the aetiological and therapeutic role of nutrition in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary lipids or pharmacologic modulation of lipid metabolism are potential therapeutic strategies in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, we analysed alterations of bioactive lipids in experimental models of colitis and examined the functional consequence of the second messenger ceramide in inflammatory pathways leading to tissue destruction. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Chronic colitis was induced by dextran-sulphate-sodium (DSS) or transfer of CD4(+)CD62L(+) cells into RAG1(-/-)-mice. Lipid content of isolated murine intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) was analysed by tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of MMP-1 in supernatants of Caco-2-IEC and human intestinal fibroblasts from patients with ulcerative colitis were determined by ELISA. Imipramine was used for pharmacologic inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). Ceramide increased by 71% in chronic DSS-induced colitis and by 159% in the transfer model of colitis. Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) decreased by 22% in both models. No changes were detected for phosphatidylcholine. Generation of ceramide by exogenous SMase increased MMP-1-protein production of Caco-2-IEC up to 7-fold. Inhibition of ASM completely abolished the induction of MMP-1 by TNF or IL-1beta in Caco-2-IEC and human intestinal fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Mucosal inflammation leads to accumulation of ceramide and decrease of LPC in the intestinal epithelium. One aspect of ceramide generation is an increase of MMP-1. Induction of MMP-1 by TNF or IL-1beta is completely blocked by inhibition of ASM with imipramine. Therefore, inhibition of ASM may offer a treatment strategy to reduce MMP-1 expression and tissue destruction in inflammatory conditions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reports of an increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders in patients receiving thiopurines for inflammatory bowel disease are controversial. We assessed this risk in a prospective observational cohort study. METHODS: 19,486 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, of whom 11,759 (60.3%) had Crohn's disease and 7727 (39.7%) had ulcerative colitis or unclassified inflammatory bowel disease, were enrolled in a nationwide French cohort by 680 gastroenterologists, who reported details of immunosuppressive therapy during the observation period, cases of cancer, and deaths. The risk of lymphoproliferative disorder was assessed according to thiopurine exposure. Median follow-up was 35 months (IQR 29-40). FINDINGS: At baseline, 5867 (30.1%) of patients were receiving, 2809 (14.4%) had discontinued, and 10,810 (55.5%) had never received thiopurines. 23 new cases of lymphoproliferative disorder were diagnosed, consisting of one case of Hodgkin's lymphoma and 22 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoproliferative disorder. The incidence rates of lymphoproliferative disorder were 0.90 per 1000 (95% CI 0.50-1.49) patient-years in those receiving, 0.20/1000 (0.02-0.72) patient-years in those who had discontinued, and 0.26/1000 (0.10-0.57) patient-years in those who had never received thiopurines (p=0.0054). The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio of lymphoproliferative disorder between patients receiving thiopurines and those who had never received the drugs was 5.28 (2.01-13.9, p=0.0007). Most cases associated with thiopurine exposure matched the pathological range of post-transplant disease. INTERPRETATION: Patients receiving thiopurines for inflammatory bowel disease have an increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders.

Epidemiologic studies present data on disease burden, but may also provide clues to disease etiology. The emergence of IBD in developing nations warrants a systematic search for environmental changes in those countries to explain the evolution of IBD. The hygiene hypothesis suggests that an alteration in the microbial environment experienced by the host facilitates the evolution of chronic immune-mediated diseases. One complex database study suggested that areas with high species richness of human intestinal helminthes are areas with genetic changes in interleukin gene loci. In other words, over the years, the microbial ecology has affected human genetics, which in turn would have an impact on immune responses. Other factors affect the gut microbiome, and several studies have explored the increase in incidence of IBD in relation to such factors as exogenous infections, use of antibiotics, and diet.},

   abstract = {Changing trends in the epidemiology of IBD provide an opportunity to examine possible etiological hypotheses. Why did IBD emerge in developed nations in the middle of the 20th century? Why did it emerge initially as ulcerative colitis but now Crohn's disease has become the predominate form of IBD in developed nations? Why is IBD emerging in recent years in developing nations and why is it that ulcerative colitis is the predominate form in these countries? In this chapter we will explore what is known about environmental issues that impact on disease presentation and where they provide opportunities for therapy. Managing smoking cessation in Crohn's disease is substantiated by evidence showing that smokers have a worse course of disease than non-smokers or than persons who quit smoking. Introducing nicotine to patients with ulcerative colitis has not brought the positive results anticipated with the widespread observation that smoking cessation was associated with flaring of this disease. Assessing and managing stress in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has emerged as an important consideration for clinicians caring for patients with IBD, especially for patients with active disease who may develop maladaptive coping mechanisms. Recent data suggest that stress may antedate flares. It is unknown what may induce changes in the gut flora of patients with IBD compared to controls. There are suggestions that antibiotic use in childhood and specific diets particularly those lower in omega-3 fatty acids may impact on disease presentation and the common mechanism may be through alteration of gut flora. For at-risk families (where there are affected family members) perhaps greater vigilance with antibiotic use in childhood and ensuring diets are higher in omega-3 fatty acids can be considered. In the future there may be approaches to modulate gut flora either with antibiotics targeted against identified noxious microbes or with selective probiotics that can rebalance the gut dysbiosis.},

We aimed to assess the prevalence and usage of CAM in different geographical areas of Italy and possible predictors of their use. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A structured questionnaire, administered to outpatients, attending 8 general hospitals and 9 tertiary referral centres, was completed by 2011 patients (909 CD, 1087 UC and 15 indeterminate colitis). 583 patients lived in the North, 659 in Central Italy and 769 in the South. RESULTS: CAM users were 475 (23.6%) with no regional differences in their distribution. Usage correlated significantly with female gender (p=0.030), higher education (p=0.021), hospitalization rates (p=0.000), extra-intestinal complications (p=0.000), non-adherence to conventional treatments (p=0.054), adverse reactions to conventional treatments (p=0.000), and active disease (p=0.007); 5-ASA usage was associated with a more limited use of CAM (p=0.005). Dietary changes or supplements and prayer were significantly more frequently reported in South, while Northern Italian patients more frequently used homeopathy, herbal medicines and physical exercises. Patients in Central Italy adopted an intermediate behavior. CAM use ameliorated the patient's general well-being according to two thirds of the users. Costs were higher for Northern patients than in Central or Southern Italy. CONCLUSION: One in four IBD patients in Italy use CAM. More money is spent on CAM in Northern Italy. Regional differences emerged as regards the type of CAM but not in terms of disease features, frequency of and reasons for CAM use, or perceived effects.},

   abstract = {Several substances, including glutamine and propionic acid but in particular butyric acid, have been proposed to be important for colonic health. beta-Glucans lead to the formation of comparatively high amounts of butyric acid, and germinated barley foodstuff obtained from brewer's spent grain (BSG), containing high amounts of beta-glucans and glutamine, has been reported to reduce the inflammatory response in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis. The present study examines how 3 barley products, whole grain barley, malt, and BSG, affect SCFA in the hindgut and serum of rats and whether the addition of Lactobacillus rhamnosus 271 to each of these diets would have further effects. Amino acids in plasma and the cecal composition of the microbiota were also analyzed. The butyric acid concentration in the distal colon and serum was higher in the malt groups than in the other groups as was the serum concentration of propionic acid. The concentrations of propionic and butyric acids were higher in the cecum and serum of rats given L. rhamnosus than in those not given this strain. The proportion of plasma glutamine and the cecal number of bifidobacteria were lower in the malt groups than in the other groups. L. rhamnosus decreased the number of cecal bifidobacteria, whereas plasma glutamine was unaffected. We conclude that malt together with L. rhamnosus 271 had greater effects on propionic and butyric acid concentrations in rats than the other barley products. This is interesting when developing food with effects on colonic health.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncommon in children younger than 2 years of age. The criteria for differentiating IBD from other diseases with similar clinical presentation is unclear. We describe 16 patients who, between 1984 and 2004, received a histological diagnosis of IBD during the first two years of life. Six patients presented with histological Crohn's disease, eight with ulcerative colitis and two with indeterminate colitis. The median age at diagnosis was 125 days (range 1 day to 18 months) and the medium follow up was 89 months (range 65 days to 20 years). The disease appeared to be very severe: four children (25%) underwent total parenteral nutrition (TPN), two received colectomy (12.5%) and three patients died. Many of the patients required an aggressive, multidrug, immunosuppressive approach (azathioprine [AZA], Infliximab, thalidomide, cyclosporine A). One child presented with a hypogammaglobulinaemia without any specific immunodeficiency, while in the other patients, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (4 cases) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (2 cases) were identified. In 6/16 cases, allergic colitis was first considered; these cases initially underwent cow's milk protein-free diet as the only therapy before IBD was finally diagnosed. In conclusion, early IBD has a severe prognosis and often needs an aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, an improper diagnosis of allergic colitis might cause an important diagnostic delay. Some severe immunodeficiencies, such as WAS and CGD, may represent a problem in terms of differential diagnosis and might be wrongly diagnosed as very early onset IBD.},

   abstract = {Rapid increase in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) incidence in developed countries, occurrence of CD in spouses and lack of complete concordance in monozygotic twins are strong arguments for the role of environmental factors in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Only two environmental factors have an established role in IBD. Smoking is a risk factor for CD and a protective factor for UC; appendectomy is a protective factor for UC. Many other environmental factors for IBD have been investigated. These are infectious agents, diet, drugs, stress and socio-economic factors. They are detailed in this paper. Among them, adherent invasive E. coli, infectious gastroenteritis, oral contraceptives and antibiotics could play a role in CD. To date, three theories integrate environmental factors to pathogenesis of IBD: hygiene, infection and cold chain. Much work remains to be done to identify risk factors for IBD. As exemplified by smoking, research of environmental risk factors of IBD is useful since it may lead to an improved disease course among patients and perhaps, to appropriate prevention among predisposed subjects. Further studies in this field are eagerly awaited.},

For instance, patients with Crohn's Disease (CD) or Ulcerative Colitis (UC) have a 12-20% increased risk for developing CRC. Preventive strategies utilizing nontoxic natural compounds that modulate immune responses could be successful in the suppression of inflammation-driven colorectal cancer in high-risk groups. The increase of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) expression and its transcriptional activity has been identified as a target for anti-inflammatory efforts, and the suppression of inflammation-driven colon cancer. PPARgamma down-modulates inflammation and elicits antiproliferative and proapoptotic actions in epithelial cells. All of which may decrease the risk for inflammation-induced CRC. This review will focus on the use of orally active, naturally occurring chemopreventive approaches against inflammation-induced CRC that target PPARgamma and therefore down-modulate inflammation.},

The following procedures were performed at the beginning of the study (T0), after 1 month (T1) and at the end of the study (T2): collection of anthropometric data (weight and height), dietary data (24 h diet recall), and blood under fasting condition for the determination of serum folic acid, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and vitamin B12. Plasma folic acid deficiency was not detected but hyperhomocysteinemia was present in six individuals and C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased (>0.5 mg/dl) in seven patients. After the patients were instructed there was a significant increase in vitamin B6 intake (about 35%) and in folate intake (49.6%). Mean plasma levels of folic acid, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 did not change, but there was a significant decrease of CRP at T1, 0.36 mg dl(-1) on average (P = 0.01), which was maintained at T2. We conclude that the increased folate intake reported by this group of patients was not reflected in improved serum concentrations of folic acid and homocysteine. However, the guidelines for the patients probably induced them to choose a more adequate diet, providing nutrients that help control the inflammatory process.},

Malnutrition is a frequent issue during IBD flares, especially in Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and nutritional support is frequently used to treat malnutrition but also in an attempt to modulate intestinal inflammation. The use of oral or enteral nutrition intervention in IBDs may be effective, alone or in combination with drugs, to achieve and maintain remission. However, standard diets are less effective than new-generation biotherapies and could be improved by supplementation with specific immunomodulatory amino acids. Experimental studies evaluating glutamine, the preferential substrate for enterocytes, are promising. Some clinical studies with oral glutamine in CD are until now disappointing, but new formulations and targeting could enhance glutamine efficacy at the site of mucosal lesions. The role of arginine, involved in nitric oxide and polyamines synthesis, still remains debated. However, the effects of these amino acids in IBD have been poorly documented in humans. Other candidates like glycine, cysteine, histidine, or taurine should also be evaluated in the future.},

   abstract = {Current smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease and worsens its course, increasing the need for steroids, immunosuppressants, and re-operations. On the contrary, smoking protects against ulcerative colitis and after disease onset improves its course, decreasing the need for colectomy. Smoking cessation improves Crohn's disease and worsens ulcerative colitis. Achieving smoking cessation in Crohn's disease is thus an important goal of therapy, whereas patients with ulcerative colitis should not be discouraged to quit, because the beneficial effect of smoking for their disease is counterbalanced by the deleterious respiratory and cardiovascular effects of tobacco. Physical activity improves quality of life without detrimental effect on disease activity, and may contribute to increase muscle mass and to prevent osteoporosis. Regarding nutrition, a Western diet may be associated with an increased risk of IBD, and a case-control study revealed an increased consumption of linoleic acid before diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Liquid diets may improve Crohn's disease flares and decrease the need for steroids; however, there are no defined diets able to improve the disease course, and in Crohn's disease, supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids did not show a significant benefit. Obesity is becoming more prevalent in IBD and may be associated with higher disease activity. In total, adhering to four simple lifestyle factors - never smoking, physical activity, prudent diet and body mass index <25 - may have a strong impact both on the prevention of major chronic diseases and on the course of IBD.},

In fact, TGF-beta is currently added to formulas intended for patients with IBD, and several studies indicate that these formulas could induce clinical remission.

   abstract = {A multidisciplinary working group has outlined evidence-based practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in children (IBD). Both diagnosis and treatment of IBD in children differ significantly from practice in adults. The incidence of IBD in children is low (5.2 per 100,000 per year in the age group 0-17 years), but most of the presenting symptoms are non-specific; therefore it is difficult for the general practitioner to recognise the disease in children. For a correct diagnosis, ileocolonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy are necessary, often combined with radiological imaging of the small bowel. In children and adolescents with Crohn's disease, nutritional therapy is the first choice of treatment for remission induction. As maintenance treatment, immunomodulators (azathioprine or mercaptopurine) should be started from the time of initial diagnosis. In children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis, the first treatment is with aminosalicylates. Prednisone and/or immunomodulators (azathioprine, cyclosporin) are indicated if there is insufficient response to aminosalicylates. A final treatment option is colectomy. The transition from paediatric to adult health care needs special attention as the patient and his or her parents may be reluctant to change trusted contacts which they have made.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dietary arachidonic acid, an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-6 PUFA), might be involved in the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). We performed a prospective cohort study to determine whether high levels of arachidonic acid in adipose tissue samples (which reflects dietary intake) are associated with UC. METHODS: We analyzed data collected from 57,053 men and women in the EPIC-Denmark Prospective Cohort Study from 1993 to 1997. Adipose tissue biopsy samples were collected from gluteal regions at the beginning of the study, the cohort was monitored over subsequent years, and participants who developed UC were identified. A subcohort of 2510 randomly selected participants were used as controls. Concentrations of arachidonic acid were measured in adipose tissue samples. In the analysis, arachidonic acid levels were divided into quartiles; relative risks (RR) were calculated and adjusted for smoking, use of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and levels of n-3 PUFAs. RESULTS: A total of 34 subjects (56% men) developed incident UC at a median age of 58.8 years (range, 50.0-69.0 years). Those in the highest quartile for arachidonic acid concentrations in adipose tissue had an RR for UC of 4.16 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.56-11.04); a trend per 0.1% increase in arachidonic acid of 1.77 in RR was observed (95% CI: 1.38-2.27). The fraction attributed the highest levels of arachidonic acid was 40.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with the highest relative concentrations of arachidonic acid in adipose tissue have a significantly greater risk of developing UC. Dietary modifications might therefore prevent UC or reduce disease symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC) is produced by Brassica food plants. PEO is a PEITC Essential Oil containing >95% natural PEITC. PEITC is known to produce various health benefits but its effect in alleviation of ulcerative colitis signs is unknown. RESULTS: In two efficacy studies (acute and chronic) oral administration of PEO was effective at remitting acute and chronic signs of ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. Disease activity, histology and biochemical characteristics were measured in the treated animals and were compared with appropriate controls. PEO treatment significantly improved body weights and stool consistency as well as decreased intestinal bleeding. PEO treatment also reduced mucosal inflammation, depletion of goblet cells and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Attenuation of proinflammatory interleukin1beta production was observed in the colons of PEO-treated animals. Expression analyses were also carried out for immune function related genes, transcription factors and cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-activated mouse macrophage cells. PEO likely affects an intricate network of immune signaling genes including a novel concentration dependent reduction of total cellular Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) as well as nuclear phosphorylated-STAT1 (activated form of STAT1). A PEO-concentration dependent decrease of mRNA of C-X-C motif ligand 10 (a STAT1 responsive chemokine) and Interleukin 6 were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: PEO might be a promising candidate to develop as a treatment for ulcerative colitis patients. The disease attenuation by PEO is likely associated with suppression of activation of STAT1 transcription and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The utility and efficacy of the laparoscopic approach to the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children are not clearly known. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective descriptive cohort study of children with a diagnosis of IBD who underwent a laparoscopic or laparoscopy-assisted procedure at a quaternary pediatric referral center between 1999 and 2007. RESULTS: One-hundred thirty-six children underwent 154 operations (85 small bowel/ileocolic and 69 colorectal) over the 8 years of the study. Median age was 14.8 years (range = 1.8-18.8). The diagnosis was Crohn's disease in 83, ulcerative colitis in 50, and indeterminate colitis in 3. Median time to regular diet was 5 days (range = 1-19), and median postoperative stay was 7 days (range = 1-70). Seven patients undergoing a small bowel/ileocolic resection (8.2%) were converted to an open procedure. Overall morbidity for the small bowel/ileocolic procedures was 27.1%. The conversion rate during subtotal colectomy (STC) was 7.1% (3/42), and it was 0% for the 22 patients who underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) procedures. Overall morbidity associated with STC was 62.8%, and following IPAA it was 63.6%. Sixteen percent (7/69) of those who underwent a colorectal procedure developed a late postoperative bowel obstruction with three patients requiring operative intervention. CONCLUSION: A laparoscopic approach is feasible with a low conversion rate in most children with IBD. Despite superior cosmesis, perioperative morbidity is similar to that seen with open procedures. Laparoscopic colorectal IBD procedures are associated with an unexpectedly high incidence of postoperative bowel obstruction, although the rates are comparable to those seen with open surgery.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Oral mesalamine (5-aminosalicylate) is the current standard of care for mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. We investigated the efficacy and safety of once daily administration of prolonged-release mesalamine granules in maintenance of remission in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis, compared with the well established twice daily dosing regimen. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, single blind, noninferiority trial, 362 patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis were randomly assigned (1:1) to groups that were given oral mesalamine 2 g, once daily, or 1 g, twice daily, for 12 months. The primary objective was to compare remission rates at 1 year, based on the ulcerative colitis disease activity index score, using Kaplan-Meier methodology. RESULTS: At 1 year, 70.9% of the group given 2 g mesalamine once daily remained in remission vs 58.9% of the group given 1 g mesalamine twice daily; this difference was statistically significant (P = .024), indicating the increased efficacy of once daily, compared with twice daily, dosing. Self-reported adherence to therapy, measured by visual analog scale score after 4, 8, and 12 months, was significantly greater in the group given 2 g mesalamine once daily, compared with twice daily, at all but 1 study visit (P < .05). Compliance measured by medication taken was not significantly different between the groups. The difference between the 2 groups in overall incidence of adverse events was not statistically significant (P = .23). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ulcerative colitis given prolonged-release oral mesalamine 2 g once daily had better remission rates, acceptability, and self-reported adherence to therapy compared with patients given oral mesalamine 1 g twice daily.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the operation of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis. Free radical activity and the status of lipid soluble antioxidant vitamins have not been previously assessed in patients with IPAA. The aim of the present study was to measure the plasma concentrations of lipophyllic antioxidants and free radical activity in IPAA patients and compare them with normal subjects. METHOD: Forty-eight IPAA patients and 50 healthy controls were studied. A dietary assessment of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and carotene was undertaken and plasma antioxidant status was assessed. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured to assess the extent of free radical damage. In IPAA patients, association between the degree of inflammation in the pouch mucosa and the plasma concentration of lipophyllic antioxidants and extent of free radical activity was investigated. RESULTS: The dietary intake of carotene was similar in both groups. Intake of vitamin E was significantly lower in patients than controls (P = 0.01). In the IPAA group plasma concentrations of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene were significantly lower (P < 0.001) and alpha-tocopherol:cholesterol ratio significantly higher (P < 0.001). Free radical damage was significantly greater in patients than controls (P < 0.01). There were no significant correlations between the degree of inflammation in the pouch and plasma concentrations of MDA, carotenoids, alpha-tocopherol:cholesterol ratio or intake of vitamins. CONCLUSION: Compared with normal subjects, patients with IPAA have significantly lower plasma concentrations of lipophyllic antioxidants alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene and higher free radical activity suggesting increased oxidative stress. These differences do not appear to be related to diet and do not correlate with histological severity of pouch inflammation.},

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are inflammatory bowel diseases for which twin studies reveal genetic susceptibility that is impacted by diet and environment. Apparently contradictory data on the role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease would be entirely explainable if genetic variability determined dietary requirements and intolerances. Considering Crohn's disease, we recognize three major classes of genes. The first of these involves bacterial recognition through pattern recognition receptors and autophagy genes, while the second act through secondary immune response, and the third concern epithelial barrier integrity. Despite genetic overlap with CD, the first two groups of genes appear to be less important in ulcerative colitis, while other genes, particularly those involved in barrier function, gain prominence. Case-control studies suggest that these different genetic groups reflect distinct dietary requirements. Such studies suggest nutrigenomic approaches to maintaining disease remission at present, and preventing disease development in the future.},

   abstract = {The Inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are debilitating conditions, characterised by lifelong sensitivity to certain foods, and often a need for surgery and life-long medication. The anti-inflammatory effects of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated acids justify their inclusion in enteral nutrition formulas that have been associated with disease remission. However, there have been variable data in clinical trials to test supplementary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in inducing or maintaining remission in these diseases. Although variability in trial design has been suggested as a major factor, we suggest that variability in processing and presentation of the products may be equally or more important. The nature of the source, and rapidity of getting the fish or other food source to processing or to market, will affect the percentage of the various fatty acids, possible presence of heavy metal contaminants and oxidation status of the various fatty acids. For dietary supplements or fortified foods, whether the product is encapsulated or not, whether storage is under nitrogen or not, and length of time between harvest, processing and marketing will again profoundly affect the properties of the final product. Clinical trials to test efficacy of these products in IBD to date have utilised the relevant skills of pharmacology and gastroenterology. We suggest that knowledge from food science, nutrition and engineering will be essential to establish the true role of this important group of compounds in these diseases.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease, which covers Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease are both inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract. In both diseases an antigen activates several inflammatory pathways, which cause extensive damage to the intestinal mucosa and lead to increased permeability of the intestinal epithelium. The causative antigen in inflammatory bowel disease is the microflora in the intestinal lumen, facilitated by an impaired innate immune system that is unable to halt the invasion of microbes into the lamina propria. These provoke T helper 1 and T helper 17 responses in Crohn's disease and a T helper 2 response in ulcerative colitis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and interleukins produced in these processes lead to impairment of tight junctions and increased permeability of the intestinal epithelial lining. In celiac disease, inflammation is caused by dietary gluten, a peptide present in wheat, barley and rye. In genetically predisposed people, gliadin peptides (derivatives of gluten) are presented on the Human Leukocyte Antigen DQ2 or DQ-8 molecules of antigen-presenting cells to T helper cells. This provokes a T helper 1 response, which leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequent damage to, and increased permeability of the intestinal epithelium. We describe the details and overlaps in the pathomechanism and genetics of inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease, and discuss potential drug targets for intervention.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Long-term results after laparoscopic ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) have not been thoroughly evaluated. Our study prospectively compares short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic and open IPAA. METHODS: Between October 2002 and November 2007, 73 laparoscopic and 106 open IPAA patients were enrolled. Patient- and disease-specific characteristics and short- and long-term outcomes were prospectively collected. RESULTS: There were no differences in demographics, treatment, indication, duration of surgery, and diversion between groups. Laparoscopic patients had faster return of flatus (p = 0.008), faster assumption of a liquid diet (p < 0.001), and less blood loss (p = 0.026). While complications were similar, the incidence of incisional hernias was lower in the laparoscopic group (p = 0.011). Mean follow-up was 24.8 months. Average number of bowel movements was 6.8 +/- 2.8/day for laparoscopy and 6.3 +/- 1.7 for open (p = 0.058). Overall, 68.4% of patients were fully continent at 1 year, up to 83.7% long term without differences between groups. Other indicators of defecatory function and quality of life remain similar overtime. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic IPAA confers excellent functional results. Most patients are fully continent and have an average of six bowel movements/day. When present, minor incontinence improves over time. Laparoscopy mirrors the results of open IPAA and is a valuable alternative to open surgery.},

However, the benefits of laparoscopic versus open surgery remain unproven within a fast-track program. Case reports of laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) colectomies are appearing with claims of cosmetic advantage and decreased parietal trauma. This report describes the largest case series of LESS colorectal surgery and its effects on recovery. METHODS: In this series, 20 consecutive unselected patients underwent LESS colorectal surgery including right hemicolectomy (n = 3), extended right hemicolectomy, high anterior resection (n = 2), low anterior resection involving total mesorectal excision (TME; n = 3), ileocolic anastomosis (n = 2, including 1 redo surgery), colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis (n = 4, including 1 with ventral mesh rectopexy), panproctocolectomy (n = 2), proctocolectomy and ileoanal pouch (n = 2) and an abdominoperineal excision of rectum. Single-port conventional instrumentation and transversus abdominus plane (TAP) block analgesia were used. The indications included cancer (n = 8), Crohn's disease (n = 4), ulcerative colitis (n = 3) complicated diverticulosis (n = 2), and slow-transit constipation (n = 3). Eight of the patients had undergone previous surgery. RESULTS: Most of the cases (90%) were managed successfully using the LESS technique and conventional instrumentation. Two operations (10%) were converted to standard laparoscopy, due to insufficient theater time and an unstable port. The operative time ranged from 45 to 240 min (median, 110 min). A normal diet was tolerated within 6 h by 7 patients and in 12 to 16 h (overnight) by 11 patients. Complications included anastomotic bleed (n = 1), ileus (n = 2), acute renal failure secondary to hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia (n = 1), urine retention (n = 1), and wound infection (n = 1). The median hospital stay was 46 h (range, 7-384 h). Eight patients were discharged within 24 h. There was one readmission (5%). CONCLUSION: Laparoendoscopic single-site colorectal resection using conventional instrumentation is feasible and safe when performed by an experienced team. The LESS approach may have advantages in terms of minimal pain, cosmesis, lower costs, and faster recovery. A randomized trial is required to confirm whether LESS offers a true patient benefit over standard laparoscopic resection.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Functional gut symptoms are common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs) appear to play an important role in the induction of functional gut symptoms, we aimed to determine the effect of their dietary restriction on abdominal symptoms in patients with stable IBD and to examine factors associated with success of and adherence to the diet. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 52 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease and 20 with ulcerative colitis who received dietary advice at least 3 months prior at a gastrointestinal dietetic service in Victoria, Australia, underwent a retrospective telephone questionnaire. Information gathered included patient demographics, recall of dietary advice, dietary adherence, and change in gastrointestinal symptoms. RESULTS: Up to 70% of patients were adherent to the diet. Approximately one in two patients responded (defined as improvement of at least 5 out of 10 in overall symptoms). Overall abdominal symptoms, abdominal pain, bloating, wind and diarrhoea improved in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (p<0.02 for all), but constipation did not. For Crohn's disease, efficacy was associated with dietary adherence (p= 0.033) and inefficacy with non-adherence (p=0.013). Sustained response was associated with post-secondary education and working 35 h per week or less (p<0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that reduction of FODMAP intake offers an efficacious strategy for patients with IBD who have concurrent functional gut symptoms. A controlled dietary intervention trial is indicated.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) affect bone metabolism and are frequently associated with the presence of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and increased risk of fractures. Although several mechanisms may contribute to skeletal abnormalities in IBD patients, inflammation and inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6 may be the most critical. It is not clear whether the changes in bone metabolism leading to decreased mineral density are the result of decreased bone formation, increased bone resorption, or both, with varying results reported in experimental models of IBD and in pediatric and adult IBD patients. New data, including our own, challenge the conventional views, and contributes to the unraveling of an increasingly complex network of interactions leading to the inflammation-associated bone loss. Since nutritional interventions (dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation) are of limited efficacy in IBD patients, understanding the pathophysiology of osteopenia and osteoporosis in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is critical for the correct choice of available treatments or the development of new targeted therapies. In this review, we discuss current concepts explaining the effects of inflammation, inflammatory mediators and their signaling effectors on calcium and phosphate homeostasis, osteoblast and osteoclast function, and the potential limitations of vitamin D used as an immunomodulator and anabolic hormone in IBD.},

Underpinning the success has been clinical excellence and adaptation of clinicians to the changing landscape of disease severity and therapeutic options.

We now report the utility of Length Heterogeneity Polymerase Chain Reaction (LH-PCR) to survey samples and a proprietary Multitagged Pyrosequencing (MTPS) methodology to interrogate the gut microbiome in healthy and disease states. We present an overview of our studies demonstrating the application of these molecular-biology techniques to an example disease state such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The findings show that there is a core mucosal bacterial microbiome (i.e., a mucosal biofilm) that is distinct from the luminal microbiome in health, and that the mucosal microbiome appears to be dysbiotic in IBD. We propose that the mucosal microbiome forms a synergistic and stable interaction with the host immune system, while the lumen microbiome varies based on diet or other environmental factors. We define this composite ecosystem of the human microbiome and human host as the Human Metabiome.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has long been considered a disease that affects predominantly a Western population. The incidence and prevalence rates from Asian populations are much lower in comparison. More recent data, however, have shown significantly higher rates in Asians and time trend studies have shown an increase in the incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) and a similar but lower rise in Crohn's disease (CD). The epidemiological changes that are taking place mirror that of the Western experience seen 50 years previously and seem to occur in parallel with the rapid socioeconomic development taking place in Asia. It appears that certain racial groups are more prone than others to develop IBD. For instance, Indians in South-East Asia have higher rates compared to Chinese and Malays. While there is host genetic predisposition, environmental factor(s) may be responsible for this difference. Migrant studies of South Asians in the UK, where second-generation immigrants have assumed incidence rates as high as the indigenous whites and Asian Jews who develop high incidence rates comparable to Jews from Europe or North America in Israel point to the role of environmental factors. It is unclear which specific factors are responsible. Studies have suggested a change in diet to a more Westernized one may underlie this epidemiological change in the Asian population. It is likely that there are racial groups amongst Asians who are more susceptible to IBD and who will demonstrate a higher frequency of IBD when exposed to putative environmental factors.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Data concerning the anti-inflammatory effect of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are inconsistent. Salmon fillet contains n-3 PUFAs and bioactive peptides that may improve its effects compared to fish oil alone. We assessed the efficacy of a salmon-rich diet in patients with mild ulcerative colitis. METHODS: An 8-week intervention pilot study was designed to assess the effects of 600 grams Atlantic salmon consumption weekly in 12 UC patients. Simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI), a dietary questionnaire, sigmoidoscopy, selected serum inflammatory markers, fecal calprotectin, and plasma and rectal biopsy fatty acid profiles were assessed before and after intervention. RESULTS: The levels of C20:4n-6 arachidonic acid in biopsies after dietary intervention were correlated with histology and endoscopy scores. The concentrations of n-3 PUFAs, C20:5n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid, C22:6n-3 docosahexaenoic acid, and the n-3/n-6 ratio increased in plasma and rectal biopsies. The anti-inflammatory fatty acid index (AIFAI) increased both in biopsies and plasma accompanied with a significantly reduced SCCAI. CONCLUSION: Based on evidence of SCCAI and AIFAI and a tendency of decreased levels of CRP and homocysteine, intake of Atlantic salmon may have beneficial effects on disease activity in patients with mild ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The colonic mucus layer plays an important role in the protection of the intestinal epithelium and mainly consists of mucin glycoproteins (primarily MUC2 in the colon) trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) and secretory IgA. Butyrate is a major end product of fermentation of dietary fibres and is associated with beneficial effects on colonic health. Earlier in-vitro and animal studies showed that butyrate modulates MUC2 and TFF3 expression and mucin secretion, although data from human studies are not yet available. METHODS: Sixteen healthy volunteers and 35 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients in clinical remission self-administered a 60 ml rectal enema containing 100 mmol/l butyrate or placebo once daily for 2 and 3 weeks, respectively. After each treatment, biopsies were taken from the distal sigmoid for quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis of MUC2 and TFF3. In addition, mucosal sections were stained with high iron diamine-alcian blue to distinguish between sialomucins and sulphomucins. To analyse total mucin secretion and secretory IgA concentrations, 24 h faeces were collected during the day before the endoscopic examination. RESULTS: The butyrate intervention did not significantly modulate the expression of MUC2 (fold change: 1.04 and 1.05 in healthy volunteers and ulcerative colitis patients, respectively) or TFF3 (fold change: 0.91 and 0.94 in healthy volunteers and UC patients, respectively). Furthermore, the percentage of sialomucins, mucus secretion and secretory IgA concentrations were not affected by the butyrate intervention in both the groups. CONCLUSION: Butyrate exposure in healthy volunteers and UC patients in remission did not affect the measured parameters of the colonic mucus layer.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Butyrate, produced by colonic fermentation of dietary fibers is often hypothesized to beneficially affect colonic health. This study aims to assess the effects of butyrate on inflammation and oxidative stress in subjects with chronically mildly elevated parameters of inflammation and oxidative stress. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with ulcerative colitis in clinical remission daily administered 60 ml rectal enemas containing 100mM sodium butyrate (n=17) or saline (n=18) during 20 days (NCT00696098). Before and after the intervention feces, blood and colonic mucosal biopsies were obtained. Parameters of antioxidant defense and oxidative damage, myeloperoxidase, several cytokines, fecal calprotectin and CRP were determined. RESULTS: Butyrate enemas induced minor effects on colonic inflammation and oxidative stress. Only a significant increase of the colonic IL-10/IL-12 ratio was found within butyrate-treated patients (p=0.02), and colonic concentrations of CCL5 were increased after butyrate compared to placebo treatment (p=0.03). Although in general butyrate did not affect colonic glutathione levels, the effects of butyrate enemas on total colonic glutathione appeared to be dependent on the level of inflammation. CONCLUSION: Although UC patients in remission were characterized by low-grade oxidative stress and inflammation, rectal butyrate enemas showed only minor effects on inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters.},

   abstract = {Underweight and specific nutrient deficiencies are frequent in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In addition, a significant number of children with IBD, especially Crohn's disease (CD) have impaired linear growth. Nutrition has an important role in the management of IBD. In adults with CD, enteral nutrition (EN) is effective in inducing clinical remission of IBD, although it is less efficient than corticosteroids. Exclusive EN is an established primary therapy for pediatric CD. Limited data suggests that EN is as efficient as corticosteroids for induction of remission. Additional advantages of nutritional therapy are control of inflammation, mucosal healing, positive benefits to growth and overall nutritional status with minimal adverse effects. The available evidence suggests that supplementary EN may be effective also for maintenance of remission in CD. More studies are needed to confirm these findings. However, EN supplementation could be considered as an alternative or as an adjunct to maintenance drug therapy in CD. EN does not have a primary therapeutic role in ulcerative colitis. Specific compositions of enteral diets-elemental diets or diets containing specific components-were not shown to have any advantage over standard polymeric diets and their place in the treatment of CD or UC need further evaluation. Recent theories suggest that diet may be implicated in the etiology of IBD, however there are no proven dietary approaches to reduce the risk of developing IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Potentially, a binding of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) to dietary fibres could reduce the systemic absorption and increase the intraluminal amount [corrected]. The purposes of the study were to investigate if: (1) dietary fibres can bind 5-ASA in vitro, and (2) consumption of dietary fibres is related to disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) treated with 5-ASA. METHODS: In vitro: 15 g of Ispaghula Husk, wheat bran, citrus-pectin, or wheat flour were incubated in a 37 degrees C buffered solutions of 5-ASA (1 g/l) for 3 hours at pH 6 and 7. The concentrations of 5-ASA were determined before and after the incubation using HPLC. In vivo: patients with UC were interviewed two to three times during 6 months. The fibre consumption was estimated and related to the disease activity (CAI, CRP, Faecal-calprotectin) and quality of life (IBDQ). RESULTS: In vitro: 5-ASA was bound to Ispaghula Husk (5.3-10.0 mg/g) and wheat bran (4.6-5.5 mg/g), and to a minor degree to citrus-pectin. No differences were found in relation to pH. In vivo: 29 patients completed the scheduled interviews. No significant changes in fibre consumption were observed over time; however, patients consuming a diet high in fibre (>20 g/day) had significantly lower CRP (p <0.01) and faecal-calprotectin (p <0.01) than those consuming less fibre (<20 g/dg). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a high intake of fibre had a lower disease activity than those with low intake. Ispaghula Husk bound 5-ASA in vitro, independent of pH. The effect might be clinically relevant in patients with UC treated with 5-ASA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls. DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4 patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20 IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P = 0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7 ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400 microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis should be explored further.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause alterations in energy requirements and invalidate the use of standard prediction equations. Our aim was to evaluate four commonly used prediction equations for resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-three children had repeated measurements of REE as part of a longitudinal research study yielding a total of 243 measurements. These were compared with predicted REE from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict equations using the Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 14.2 (2.4) years. Mean measured REE was 1566 (336) kcal per day compared with 1491 (236), 1441 (255), 1481 (232), and 1435 (212) kcal per day calculated from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict, respectively. While the Schofield equation demonstrated the least difference between measured and predicted REE, it, along with the other equations tested, did not perform uniformly across all subjects, indicating greater errors at either end of the spectrum of energy expenditure. Smaller differences were found for all prediction equations for Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly used equations, the equation of Schofield should be used in pediatric patients with IBD when measured values are not able to be obtained.},

In the fasting state, both the spectral frequency and IF of the epigastric 3-cycle per minute (cpm) group of the TC subjects were significantly lower than those indices in C, TG, DG, and CR subjects. In contrast, the power amplitude and power content of the epigastric 3-cpm group of both TG and DG subjects were significantly lower than those of C and TC subjects. The original epigastric waves of TG had remarkably high amplitudes. Furthermore, the absolute power of the epigastric 3-cpm of the TC subjects was 10 times higher than that in either the C or TG subjects. These results may be partially explained by the assumption that the recorded epigastric electrogastrography (EGG) is mainly contributed to by the 3-cpm myoelectric activity of the stomach and colon, while the infraumbilical EGG is mainly contributed to by the 3-cpm myoelectric activity of the colon. Topographic EGG maps visually supported these assumptions.},

   abstract = {The relationship between a predisposition to obesity and the development of colitis is not well understood. Our aim was to characterize the adipokine response and the extent of colitis in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats. DIO and control, diet-resistant (DR) animals were administered either saline or trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) to induce colitis. Macroscopic damage scores and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were measured to determine the extent of inflammation. Trunk blood was collected for the analysis of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as well as leptin, ghrelin, and adiponectin. Colonic epithelial physiology was assessed using Ussing chambers. DIO rats had a modestly increased circulating PAI-1 before TNBS treatment; however, during colitis, DR animals had more than a fourfold increase in circulating PAI-1 compared with DIO rats. Circulating leptin was higher in DIO rats compared with DR animals, in the inflamed and noninflamed states. These changes in TNBS-induced adipokine profile were accompanied by decreased macroscopic tissue damage score in DIO animals compared with DR tissues. Furthermore, TNBS-treated DR animals lost significantly more weight than DIO rats during active inflammation. Colonic epithelial physiology was comparable between groups, as was MPO activity. The factors contributing to the decreased colonic damage are almost certainly multifold, driven by both genetic and environmental factors, of which adipokines are likely to play a part given the increasing body of evidence for their role in modulating intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {Turner syndrome is a chromosomal disease frequently associated with autoimmune disorders including diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although the etiology of IBD has not been fully elucidated, genetic analysis has recently revealed several susceptibility genes. Recently, cases with Turner syndrome associated with IBD have been reported. We report here a 13-yr-old girl with Turner syndrome associated with ulcerative colitis. The patient was undergoing growth hormone treatment and presented with abdominal discomfort and bloody diarrhea. Her karyotype pattern was 46,X,i(Xq). Barium enema revealed punctate collections of barium suggesting microulcerations in the descending and sigmoid colon with loss of haustra. Flexible sigmoidoscopy showed that the mucosa was erythematous and friable upon touch and that the wall had frank hemorrhage and inflammatory polyp formation from the anal verge through the splenic flexure. Histologically, mucosal and submucosal inflammation was prominent, suggesting cryptitis and crypt abscess formation. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed as having ulcerative colitis, and 5-aminosalicylic acid, prednisolone and dietary therapy were initiated. Our observations in this patient suggest that X chromosome abnormality may influence the development of IBD and that screening for gastrointestinal disease in patients with Turner syndrome may help lengthen life expectancy in these patients.},

In a randomized, double-blind trial, faeces were collected from healthy volunteers, and from patients with active CD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable bowel syndrome before and after treatment. The levels of F. prausnitzii DNA in faecal suspensions were determined by PCR. Treatment by an elemental diet was effective, resulting in decreases in both the Harvey and Bradshaw index (P<0.001) and the concentrations of serum C-reactive protein (P<0.05). The total levels of F. prausnitzii in faecal samples from CD patients at presentation were lower than those in the other groups both before and after the treatment. There was no correlation between F. prausnitzii abundance and the severity of CD before treatment. Clinical improvement unexpectedly correlated with a significant decrease in the abundance of F. prausnitzii, especially the A2-165 subgroup (P<0.05). Our data suggest that a paucity of F. prausnitzii in the gastrointestinal microbial communities is likely to be a minor aetiological factor in CD: recovery following elemental diet is attributed to lower levels of gut flora.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aetiology of ulcerative colitis (UC) is largely unknown, although it is plausible that dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may be protective. Metabolites derived from n-3 PUFAs are less proinflammatory than those from n-6 PUFAs. Earlier, no prospective cohort studies have investigated this hypothesis, using dietary information collected from food diaries. The aim of this study was to investigate the total dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs and the specific n-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the risk of developing incident UC. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-five thousand six hundred and thirty-nine participants, living in Norfolk UK, aged 45-74 years (median age at recruitment of 59.2 years), completed 7-day food diaries. These were interpreted using a computer programme, which converted food items into nutrients, including n-3 PUFAs. The cohort was monitored for participants who developed UC. Each case was matched with four controls and an analysis performed using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: In the cohort, 22 incident cases of UC were identified after a median follow-up time of 4.2 years (range 1.8-8.3 years). A statistically significant protective odds ratio (OR) for the trend across tertiles was found for DHA [OR = 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.22-0.86, P = 0.02] and borderline statistically significant differences for trends for total total n-3 PUFAs (OR = 0.56, 95% CI=0.28-1.13, P = 0.10) and EPA (OR = 0.53, 95% CI=0.27-1.03, P = 0.06) after adjusting for age, sex, total energy intake, smoking, and other fatty acids. CONCLUSION: Total dietary n-3 PUFAs, EPA, and DHA, particularly DHA were associated with protection from UC in a cohort aged over 45 years. If the association is causal, then increasing the population's intake of n-3 PUFAs from oily fish may help prevent UC.},

   abstract = {It is well established that intestinal microbiota play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Various methods of altering the composition of intestinal microbiota have been examined. Recent evidence suggests that the administration of select prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics may improve the clinical outcome of patients with IBD. In addition, IBD patients are well known to carry a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer due to chronic inflammation. Therefore, probiotics and/or prebiotics may be appropriate treatments for prophylactic use due to their physiologic characteristics and lack of obvious toxicity. This review summarizes the current experimental and clinical knowledge about the role of intestinal microbiota in IBD, the prevention of carcinogenesis related to IBD, and its importance as a target for new forms of neutraceutical therapy.},

   abstract = {It is unclear why patients with inflammation of the distal bowel complain of symptoms referable to the upper gastrointestinal tract, specifically to gastric emptying (GE) disturbances. Thus we aimed to determine occurrence and putative pathomechanisms of gastric motor disorders in such patients. Thirteen healthy subjects (CON), 13 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 10 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 7 with diverticulitis (DIV) underwent a standardized (13)C-octanoic acid gastric emptying breath test. Plasma glucose, CCK, peptide YY, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) were measured periodically and correlated with GE parameters. Results were given in means +/- SD. Compared with CON, GE half time (T) was prolonged by 50% in CD (115 +/- 55 vs. 182 +/- 95 min, P = 0.037). Six CD, 2 DIV, and 2 UC patients had pathological T (>200 min). Postprandial plasma glucose was increased in all patients but was highest in DIV and correlated with T (r = 0.90, P = 0.006). In CD, mean postprandial CCK levels were increased threefold compared with CON (6.5 +/- 6.7 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.6 pmol/l, P = 0.027) and were correlated with T (r = 0.60, P = 0.041). Compared with CON, GLP-1 levels were increased in UC (25.1 +/- 5.2 vs. 33.5 +/- 13.0 pmol/l, P = 0.046) but markedly decreased in DIV (9.6 +/- 5.2 pmol/l, P < 0.0001). We concluded that a subset of patients with CD, UC, or DIV has delayed GE. GE disturbances are most pronounced in CD and might partly be caused by excessive CCK release. In DIV there might be a pathophysiological link between decreased GLP-1 release, postprandial hyperglycemia, and delayed GE. These explorative data encourage further studies in larger patient groups.},

By using prospectively gathered data, laparoscopic and open restorative proctocolectomy procedures in mucosal ulcerative colitis (UC) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients were compared using a case-matched design. METHODS: Ten consecutive patients have had laparoscopic ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) since April 2005. Their intraoperative findings, immediate and early postoperative outcomes are compared with ten non-selected patients who had an open IPAA pre April 2005. RESULTS: Laparoscopic IPAA group had a shorter time to ileostomy function, a reduced mean time to regular diet and a mean shorter hospital stay. Their overall opioid analgesia requirements were 50% that of the open group. There were no re-operations or readmissions in either group. Mean operative time was longer for the laparoscopic group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing laparoscopic IPAA can expect faster postoperative gastrointestinal recovery, reduced blood loss, reduced opioid requirements and improved cosmesis.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK), menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of these vitamins.},

Furthermore, a significant number of IBD patients fail to comply with treatment. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of non-adherence the use of CAM in Hungarian patients with IBD. METHODS: A total of 655 consecutive IBD patients (Crohn's disease [CD]: 344, age: 38.2 + or - 12.9 years; ulcerative colitis [UC]: 311, age: 44.9 + or - 15.3 years) were interviewed during the visit at specialists by self-administered questionnaire including demographic and disease-related data, as well as items analyzing the extent of non-adherence and CAM use. Patients taking more then 80% of each prescribed medicine were classified as adherent. RESULTS: The overall rate of self reported non-adherence (CD: 20.9%, UC: 20.6%) and CAM (CD: 31.7%, UC: 30.9%) use was not different between CD and UC. The most common causes of non-adherence were: forgetfulness (47.8%), too many/unnecessary pills (39.7%), being afraid of side effects (27.9%) and too frequent dosing. Most common forms of CAM were herbal tee (47.3%), homeopathy (14.6%), special diet (12.2%), and acupuncture (5.8%). In CD, disease duration, date of last follow-up visit, educational level and previous surgeries were predicting factors for non-adherence. Alternative medicine use was associated in both diseases with younger age, higher educational level and immunosuppressant use. In addition, CAM use in UC was more common in females and in patients with supportive psychiatric/psychological therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Non-adherence and CAM use is common in patients with IBD. Special attention should be paid to explore the identified predictive factors during follow-up visits to improve adherence to therapy and improving patient-doctor relationship.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is only partially understood; various environmental and host (e.g. genetic, epithelial, immune, and nonimmune) factors are involved. The critical role for environmental factors is strongly supported by recent worldwide trends in IBD epidemiology. One important environmental factor is smoking. A meta-analysis partially confirms previous findings that smoking was found to be protective against ulcerative colitis and, after the onset of the disease, might improve its course, decreasing the need for colectomy. In contrast, smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease and aggravates its course. The history of IBD is dotted by cyclic reports on the isolation of specific infectious agents responsible for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The more recently published cold chain hypothesis is providing an even broader platform by linking dietary factors and microbial agents. An additional, recent theory has suggested a breakdown in the balance between putative species of 'protective' versus 'harmful' intestinal bacteria - this concept has been termed dysbiosis resulting in decreased bacterial diversity. Other factors such as oral contraceptive use, appendectomy, dietary factors (e.g. refined sugar, fat, and fast food), perinatal events, and childhood infections have also been associated with both diseases, but their role is more controversial. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that economic development, leading to improved hygiene and other changes in lifestyle ('westernized lifestyle') may play a role in the increase in IBD. This review article focuses on the role of environmental factors in the pathogenesis and progression of IBDs.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of two main disorders, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, that cause chronic, recurrent inflammation of the intestine. An inappropriate immune response to the enteric ecosystem has been postulated to cause IBD. Genomewide association studies provide the information of diverse genetic variations and susceptibilities to patients with IBD. Through the application of these studies, the pathogenesis of IBD may result in part from genetic abnormalities that regulate epithelial barrier function and innate and adaptive immune responses. Crohn's disease shows strong association with CARD15, ATG15L1, and IRGM, which are involved in the innate immunity. In the adaptive immune response, IL23R, MST1, IL12B, and STAT3 polymorphisms are associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Current pharmacologic treatment of IBD, including 5-aminosalycylate, steroids, and immunomodulator therapy, are mainly aimed at suppressing inflammation non-specifically, except biologic therapies such as anti-tumor necrosis factor molecule, which block specific proinflammatory molecules. For nutritional issues in IBD, the mainstay of therapy has been supportive, with particular attention paid to the prevention, recognition, and therapy of nutritional deficiencies, and individual outcomes to specific dietary factors have been controversial. Parenteral nutritional support and exclusionary diets have been investigated and are not the subject of this review. The emerging concepts of nutrition-gene interaction gave birth to unique scientific fields, nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics. These studies provide information about 1) the genetic variability that induces an individual's response to nutrition according to particular states of health and disease and 2) changes in gene expression that develop as a result of nutrition-gene interaction. For IBD, the role of diet in the regulation of the immune response against gut flora is the subject of current intensive evaluation. These approaches may lead clinicians to derive a personalized nutritional prescription based on individual genetic variations and may result in a significant impact on IBD treatment.},

Older as well as more recent studies show beneficial effects in experimental colitis and lately also in human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and chronic pouchitis. In this review we give an overview of the benefits of prebiotics in rodent IBD models and in IBD patients and discuss their possible protective mechanisms. Commensal intestinal bacteria induce and perpetuate chronic intestinal inflammation, whereas others are protective. However, most of the current medications are directed against the exaggerated proinflammatory immune response of the host, some of them toxic and costly. Feeding prebiotics changes the composition of the intestinal microflora toward more protective intestinal bacteria and alters systemic and mucosal immune responses of the host. Therapy for IBD targeting intestinal bacteria and their function is just emerging. Prebiotics have the promise to be relatively safe, inexpensive, and easy to administer. Unraveling their protective mechanisms will help to develop rational applications of prebiotics. However, the initial promising results with dietary prebiotics in preclinical trials as well as small studies in human IBD will need to be confirmed in large randomized controlled clinical trials.},

METHODS: Overall, 83 new cases of IBD (41 ulcerative colitis, 42 Crohn's disease) and 160 healthy controls were studied. Portions per week of 34 foods and beverages before onset of symptoms were recorded using a validated questionnaire. Duration of symptoms before IBD diagnosis, presence of specific symptoms and their impact on subjective changes in usual dietary habits were also recorded. The association between diet and IBD was investigated by multiple logistic regression and dietary patterns were assessed by factor analysis. RESULTS: Changes in dietary habits, due to the presence of symptoms, were reported by 38.6% of patients and were not significantly related to specific symptoms, rather to long duration of symptoms, only in Crohn's disease patients. In IBD patients who did not change dietary habits, moderate and high consumption of margarine (OR = 11.8 and OR = 21.37) was associated with ulcerative colitis, whilst high consumption of red meat (OR = 7.8) and high intake of cheese were associated with Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: More than one third of IBD patients change dietary habits before diagnosis. Margarine, red meat and cheese increase the risk of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {The immune system responds to pathogens by a variety of pattern recognition molecules such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which promote recognition of dangerous foreign pathogens. However, recent evidence indicates that normal intestinal microbiota might also positively influence immune responses, and protect against the development of inflammatory diseases. One of these elements may be short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are produced by fermentation of dietary fibre by intestinal microbiota. A feature of human ulcerative colitis and other colitic diseases is a change in 'healthy' microbiota such as Bifidobacterium and Bacteriodes, and a concurrent reduction in SCFAs. Moreover, increased intake of fermentable dietary fibre, or SCFAs, seems to be clinically beneficial in the treatment of colitis. SCFAs bind the G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43, also known as FFAR2), and here we show that SCFA-GPR43 interactions profoundly affect inflammatory responses. Stimulation of GPR43 by SCFAs was necessary for the normal resolution of certain inflammatory responses, because GPR43-deficient (Gpr43(-/-)) mice showed exacerbated or unresolving inflammation in models of colitis, arthritis and asthma. This seemed to relate to increased production of inflammatory mediators by Gpr43(-/-) immune cells, and increased immune cell recruitment. Germ-free mice, which are devoid of bacteria and express little or no SCFAs, showed a similar dysregulation of certain inflammatory responses. GPR43 binding of SCFAs potentially provides a molecular link between diet, gastrointestinal bacterial metabolism, and immune and inflammatory responses.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Iron and/or vitamin B12 deficiency anemias, which have adverse effects on patients' quality of life, are commonly observed and often overlooked complications after restorative proctocolectomy. We performed a systematic review of publications on the prevalence of anemia as well as on the impact of anemia on a range of clinical, functional, quality of life, and economic outcomes in restorative proctocolectomy patients. This information is important to help healthcare providers through a comprehensive overview to increase awareness about a condition that could require therapy to improve patient healthcare and quality of life. METHODS: We reviewed the English language publications on the incidence of anemia and its adverse effect after restorative proctocolectomy The United States National Library of Medicine database (MEDLINE), the Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), the Cochran Library, and the Google search engine were searched for published articles on the prevalence and impact of anemia in post-restorative proctocolectomy surgical patients. RESULTS: The long-term complication most frequently described after RPC is pouchitis. Pouchitis is significantly associated with iron deficiency anemia caused by pouch mucosal bleeding. Other causes are insufficient and/or impaired iron absorption. It has also been observed, however, that restorative proctocolectomy patients with underlying familial adenomatous polyposis rarely develop pouchitis yet show higher rates of iron deficiency anemia compared to those patients with underlying ulcerative colitis. Other causes shown as independent risk factors for iron deficiency anemia in restorative proctocolectomy patients are malignancy, desmoid tumors, and J-pouch configuration. Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is also common after restorative proctocolectomy. About one-third of restorative proctocolectomy patients show abnormal Schilling test and 5 percent have low referenced serum cobalamin. It has been observed that the degree resection of the terminal-ileum, malabsorption, bacterial overgrowth, and dietary factors are among the known causes of cobalamin deficiency. Folate deficiency has not been reported in restorative proctocolectomy patients. Describing restorative proctocolectomy surgery and its outcomes, in patients without anemia, the quality of life is reported excellent regardless of operative technique. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is not uncommon following restorative proctocolectomy and has been shown to have negative effects on the patient's quality of life and the economy and may substantially increase healthcare costs. The treatment of anemia and its underlying causes is important to improving clinical and economic outcomes.},

The etiology of IBD has been extensively studied during the last several decades; however, causative factors in disease pathology are not yet fully understood. IBD is thought to result from the interaction between genetic and environmental factors that influence the normal intestinal commensal flora to trigger an inappropriate mucosal immune response. Although many IBD susceptibility genes have been discovered, similar advances in defining environmental risk factors have lagged. A number of environmental risk factors have been explored, including smoking, appendectomy, oral contraceptives, diet, breastfeeding, infections/ vaccinations, antibiotics, and childhood hygiene. However, most of these factors have demonstrated inconsistent findings, thus making additional studies necessary to better understand the etiology of IBD.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colonic mucosa that can dramatically increase the risk of colon cancers. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a dietary intervention of freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB), a natural food product with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bioactivities, on disease severity in an experimental mouse model of UC using 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). C57BL/6J mice were fed either a control diet or a diet containing BRB (5 or 10%) for 7-14 days and then the extent of colonic injury was assessed. Dietary BRB markedly reduced DSS-induced acute injury to the colonic epithelium. This protection included better maintenance of body mass and reductions in colonic shortening and ulceration. BRB treatment, however, did not affect the levels of either plasma nitric oxide or colon malondialdehyde, biomarkers of oxidative stress that are otherwise increased by DSS-induced colonic injury. BRB treatment for up to 7 days suppressed tissue levels of several key pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1beta. Further examination of the inflammatory response by western blot analysis revealed that 7 day BRB treatment reduced the levels of phospho-IkappaBalpha within the colonic tissue. Colonic cyclooxygenase 2 levels were also dramatically suppressed by BRB treatment, with a concomitant decrease in the plasma prostaglandin E(2) (276 versus 34 ng/ml). These findings demonstrate a potent anti-inflammatory effect of BRB during DSS-induced colonic injury, supporting its possible therapeutic or preventive role in the pathogenesis of UC and related neoplastic events.},

Bacterial interactions with the gastrointestinal epithelium may be a trigger for inflammatory changes which occur in the gut. Antibiotics have been shown to alter disease activity in Crohn's disease. Probiotics (live microorganisms) administered for therapeutic purposes have been proposed due to the possibility of their altering the interaction of the gut mucosa with enteric bacteria. Extensive randomized trials are lacking in this area at this time. Current trials indicate the possibility of maintaining remission in pouchitis (non-specific inflammation) and the potential for inducing and maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. Trials in Crohn's disease have shown mixed results.},

We investigated DNA damage induced in vitro in lymphocytes from IBD patients caused by oxidative stress through H(2)O(2) and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and whether the plant flavonoids, quercetin and epicatechin, found in fruits, tea and soybeans could effectively reduce such stress. Lymphocytes from IBD patients and healthy volunteers were treated with 50 microg/ml H(2)O(2) or IQ in the presence of quercetin (0-250 microg/ml) or epicatechin (0-100 microg/ml). Flavonoid supplementation (250 microM quercetin or 100 microM epicatechin) caused an overall significant decrease of induced DNA damage resulting in a 48.6% (P < 0.001) reduction of H(2)O(2)-induced and a 43% (P < 0.001) reduction of IQ-induced DNA damage within the patient groups; for the control groups, reductions in DNA damage were 35.2 and 57.1%, respectively (both, P < 0.001). There was less induced DNA damage within lymphocytes from UC patients compared to CD patients for both series of experiments (H(2)O(2) and quercetin, IQ and epicatechin). In conclusion, flavonoids dramatically reduced oxidative stress in vitro in lymphocytes from IBD patients and healthy individuals. Thus, flavonoids could be very effective in the treatment of oxidative stress and encouraged in the diet of IBD patients.},

Although nitric oxide (NO) is reported to be involved in the onset and progression of IBDs, it remains controversial as to whether NO is toxic or protective in experimental colitis. We investigated the effects of oral nitrite as a NO donor on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis in mice. Mice were fed DSS in their drinking water with or without nitrite for up to 7days. The severity of colitis was assessed by disease activity index (DAI) observed over the experimental period, as well as by the other parameters, including colon lengths, hematocrit levels, and histological scores at day 7. DSS treatment induced severe colitis by day 7 with exacerbation in DAI and histological scores. We first observed a significant decrease in colonic nitrite levels and increase in colonic TNF-alpha expression at day 3 after DSS treatment, followed by increased colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and increased colonic expressions of both inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) at day 7. Oral nitrite supplementation to colitis mice reversed colonic nitrite levels and TNF-alpha expression to that of normal control mice at day 3, resulting in the reduction of MPO activity as well as iNOS and HO-1 expressions in colonic tissues with clinical and histological improvements at day 7. These results suggest that oral nitrite inhibits inflammatory process of DSS-induced experimental colitis by supplying nitrite-derived NO instead of impaired colonic NOS activity.},

Colitis, a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by inflammation of colon. The pathology in colitis includes disruption of crypt architecture, inflammation of crypts, frank crypt abscesses, and hemorrhage or inflammatory cells in the lamina propria. Since oxidative stress plays an important role in the etiology of Inflammatory Bowel diseases,and Garcinia kola (GK), have been shown to reduce oxidative stress in the rat stomach.The present study was designed to investigate the effects of Garcinia kola on ulcerative colitis (UC) induced by acetic acid. Albino rats were divided into five groups; Group one served as control, group two received Normal saline, group three received 2.5% ethanol while groups four and five were given 20mg/kg and 100mg/kg of crude extract of Garcinia kolarespectively. In another experiment, rats were fed for 2 weeks on normal rat diets but specially composed to contain 12.5%, 25% and 50% by weight of G kola. Colitis was induced by intra-rectal administration of 6% acetic acid. The colonic damage was elucidated by macroscopic damage scores; colon wet weight, stool consistency and colonic edema (thickness of the colon). Intra-luminal administration of 6% acetic acid resulted in observable clinical and macroscopic signs of colitis.Pre-orally administered of crude extract of GK significantly reduced the colonic damage score (p<0.001), colon weight (p<0.001), thickness of the colon (p<0.001) and diarrhea (p<0.001).Histological examinations also indicated a marked reduction in tissue injury and inhibition in neutrophil infiltration in rats pretreated with crude extract of Garcinia kola. Results of this investigation provide experimental evidence of Garcinia kola as an anti-colitis agent.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet is a major factor in the etiology of colorectal cancer, with high fish consumption possibly decreasing colorectal cancer risk, as was shown in several observational studies. To date, no intervention trials have examined the possible beneficial effects of fish intake on colorectal cancer risk. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the effects of a 6-mo intervention with oil-rich or lean fish on apoptosis and mitosis within the colonic crypt. DESIGN: In a multicenter, randomized, controlled intervention trial, patients with colorectal polyps, inactive ulcerative colitis, or no macroscopic signs of disease were recruited (n = 242) and randomly allocated to receive dietary advice plus either 300 g oil-rich fish (salmon) per week (n = 82), 300 g lean fish (cod) per week (n = 78), or only dietary advice (DA) (n = 82). Apoptosis and mitosis were measured in colonic biopsy samples collected before and after intervention (n = 213). RESULTS: The total number of apoptotic cells per crypt did not increase in the salmon or cod group: -0.10 (95% CI: -0.36, 0.16) and -0.06 (95% CI: -0.32, 0.20), respectively, compared with the DA group. The total number of mitotic cells per crypt decreased nonsignificantly in the salmon group (-0.87; 95% CI: -2.41, 0.68) and in the cod group (-1.04; 95% CI: -2.62, 0.53) compared with the DA group. Furthermore, the distribution of mitosis within the crypt did not significantly change in either group. CONCLUSION: An increase in the consumption of either oil-rich or lean fish to 2 portions weekly over 6 mo does not markedly change apoptotic and mitotic rates in the colonic mucosa. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00145015.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease involving superficial inflammation of the mucosa of the colon, rectum, and anus, sometimes including the terminal ileum. When in clinical activity, the disease is characterized by various daily evacuations containing blood, mucus and/or pus alternating periods of remission. OBJECTIVE: To compare nutritional parameters (dietary, biochemical and anthropometric) among patients with ulcerative colitis followed up on an outpatient basis over a period of 1 year and during periods of intestinal inflammatory activity and remission. METHODS: Sixty-five patients were studied over a period of 1 year and divided into two groups: group 1 with inflammatory disease activity (n = 24), and group 2 without disease activity (n = 41). Anthropometric measures, biochemical parameters, quantitative food intake, and qualitative food frequency were analyzed. RESULTS: A significant reduction in body mass index and weight and in the intake of energy, proteins, lipids, calcium, iron and phosphorus was observed in the group with inflammatory activity (group 1) when compared to the period of clinical remission. The most affected food groups were cereals, legumes, oils, and fats. In contrast, in group 2 significant differences in triceps and sub scapular skin fold thickness, total protein, hemoglobin and hematocrit were observed between the first and final visit. Calcium and vitamin B6 intake, as well as the consumption of legumes, meat and eggs, and sugar and sweets, was significantly higher than on the first visit. CONCLUSION: Patients with ulcerative colitis followed up on an outpatient basis tend to be well nourished. However, the nutritional aspects studied tend to worsen during the period of inflammatory disease activity.},

AIM: To evaluate the relationships between inflammatory parameters, plasma lipids and phospholipid fatty acid (FA) composition in patients with active UC and CD. METHODS: Diet, the Harvey-Bradshaw Activity Index (HBAI), inflammatory parameters, lipoproteins and FA composition were assessed in 60 CD and 34 UC. RESULTS: No differences in clinical parameters were observed in the two groups. Total cholesterol correlated inversely with the number of bowel movements in both groups and directly with BMI in UC. Arachidonic acid correlated inversely with HBAI in UC and total and HDL cholesterol were inversely related to C-reactive protein (CRP) in CD while HDL correlated with CRP in UC. Docosapentaenoic acid was the only polyunsaturated n-3 FA that was correlated to CRP in both groups. Total cholesterol was independently associated in the multiple regression analysis with the number of bowel movements and systemic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Total and LDL cholesterol were lower in the active UC and CD than in the healthy subjects and were correlated with the systemic inflammatory status. Phospholipid FA composition was correlated to the systemic inflammatory status, but was unrelated to dietary intake and intestinal disease activity.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that starch-entrapped microspheres would produce favourable fermentation profiles and microbial shifts during in vitro fermentation with the faecal microbiota from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In vitro fermentation was carried out using a validated, dynamic, computer-controlled model of the human colon (Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek gastro-intestinal model-2) after inoculation with pooled faeces from healthy individuals, patients with inactive IBD (Crohn's disease (CD)) or patients with active IBD (ulcerative colitis (UC)). Starch-entrapped microspheres fermented more slowly and produced more butyrate than fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) when fermented with the faecal microbiota from patients with active UC. When fermented with the microbiota from patients with inactive CD, starch-entrapped microspheres also fermented more slowly but produced similar amounts of butyrate compared with FOS. Starch-entrapped microspheres showed a greater ability to maintain a low pH during simulated-distal colon conditions compared with FOS. After fermentation with the microbiota from inactive CD patients, starch-entrapped microspheres resulted in lower concentrations of some potentially harmful gut bacteria, included in Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Fusobacterium and Veillonella, compared with FOS. These findings suggest that slow fermenting starch-entrapped microspheres may induce a favourable colonic environment in patients with IBD through high butyrate production, maintenance of low pH in the distal colon and inhibition of the growth of potentially harmful bacteria.},

   abstract = {Inflammation is part of the normal host response to infection and injury. However, inappropriate inflammation contributes to several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Both conditions are characterized by the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, arachidonic acid (AA)-derived eicosanoids, and other inflammatory agents (e.g., reactive oxygen species, adhesion molecules). By virtue of their anti-inflammatory action, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may be beneficial in inflammatory diseases. A large body of evidence supports a protective effect of omega-3 PUFA in experimental animal and ex-vivo models of Crohn's disease (CD), Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although fish oil supplementation in patients with IBD results in omega-3 PUFA incorporation into gut mucosal tissue and modification of inflammatory mediator profiles, the evidence of clinical benefits of omega-3 PUFA is weak. On the other hand, more convincing data support the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA in reducing pain, number of tender joints, duration of morning stiffness, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and improving physical performance in RA patients. In both IBD and RA further clinical trials with large sample size are needed to clarify the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA as a treatment.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis is a nonspecific inflammatory disorder characterized by oxidative and nitrosative stress, leucocyte infiltration and upregulation of inflammatory mediators. Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound found in grapes and wine, with multiple pharmacological actions, mainly anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumour and immunomodulatory activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary resveratrol on chronic dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Six-week-old mice were randomized into two dietary groups: one standard diet and the other enriched with resveratrol at 20mg/kg of diet. After 30days, mice were exposed to 3% DSS for 5days developing acute colitis that progressed to severe chronic inflammation after 21days of water. Our results demonstrated that resveratrol group significantly attenuated the clinical signs such as loss of body weight, diarrhea and rectal bleeding improving results from disease activity index and inflammatory score. Moreover, the totality of resveratrol-fed animals survived and finished the treatment while animals fed with standard diet showed a mortality of 40%. Three weeks after DSS removal, the polyphenol caused substantial reductions of the rise of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and an increase of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Also resveratrol reduced prostaglandin E synthase-1 (PGES-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) proteins expression, via downregulation of p38, a mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signal pathway. We conclude that resveratrol diet represents a novel approach to the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk for developing ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated colorectal cancer (CRC). Several studies have shown that extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) might possess anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and antiapoptotic effects. We have evaluated EVOO diet effects on the severity of repeated colitis-associated CRC. METHODS: Six-week-old C57BL/6 mice were randomized into two dietary groups: sunflower oil (SFO) and EVOO diets, both at 10%. Mice were exposed to 15 cycles of 0.7% dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) for 1 week followed by distilled water for 10 days. After, the rats were sacrificed and colonic damage was both histologically and biochemically assessed. RESULTS: Disease activity index (DAI) was significantly higher on SFO vs. EVOO diet at the end of the experimental period. EVOO-fed mice showed less incidence and multiplicity of tumors than in those SFO-fed mice. beta-catenin immunostaining was limited to cell membranes in control groups, whereas translocation from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm and/or nucleus was showed in DSS-treated groups and its expression was higher in SFO-fed animals. Cytokine production was significantly enhanced in SFO-fed mice, while this increase was not significant in EVOO-fed mice. Conversely, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxidase synthase (iNOS) expression were significantly lower in the animal group fed with EVOO than in the SFO group. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that EVOO diet has protective/preventive effect in the UC-associated CRC. This beneficial effect was correlated with a better DAI, a minor number of dysplastic lesions, a lower beta-catenin immunoreactivity, a proinflammatory cytokine levels reduction, a non modification of p53 expression and, COX-2 and iNOS reduction in the colonic tissue.},

RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological observations and clinical findings have strengthened the concept that both nutritional deficiencies and nutritional excesses impair the gastrointestinal response(s) and alter susceptibility to inflammation and other diseases. The interaction of micronutrient intake, biochemical indicators of nutritional status, and four specific gastrointestinal inflammation states are reviewed. These conditions include celiac disease and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies resulting from the sustained adherence to a gluten-free diet; micronutrient nutrition as an important determinant of immunity for two major types of inflammatory bowel disease: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; and HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies which may be exacerbated by the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy. SUMMARY: For each inflammation 'state', enhancement of micronutrient status can improve immunocompetance and minimize therapeutic side-effects. The impact of single-micronutrient deficiencies on immune responses, and the possible impact of uncorrected micronutrient status are discussed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Bone mineral density (BMD) can be adversely affected by the chronic nature of inflammatory bowel disease. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the surgical treatment of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who require proctocolectomy. There are few data on BMD in UC patients with IPAA. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors associated with low BMD in UC patients after IPAA. METHODS: A total of 327 eligible patients with UC and IPAA from the Pouchitis Clinic were enrolled. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was performed. Patients were classified as having normal or low BMD, based on the criteria by the International Society for Clinical Densitometry. A total of 39 demographic and clinical variables were evaluated with logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of 327 patients with a median of 4 years after IPAA, 105 (32.1%) had low BMD. Fragility fracture was documented in 11 patients (10.5%) in the low BMD group and in 13 of 222 patients (5.9%) in the normal BMD group (P=0.14). In the multivariable analysis, covariate-adjusted factors associated with a low BMD were advanced age (odds ratio (OR) =1.64 per 5 years; 95% CI, 1.44-1.87), low body mass index (OR=0.43 per 5 kg/m(2); 95% CI, 0.30-0.62), and non-use of daily calcium supplement (OR=0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.96). Pouch-associated factors were not found to be significantly associated with the bone loss. CONCLUSIONS: Low BMD was common in patients with UC, even after colectomy and IPAA. Low BMD in this patient population was associated with certain risk factors, some of which may be modifiable.},

Diagnosis can be made at any age, no sex predominance is apparent, and while mortality rates are similar to in general population, higher rates of colorec-tal cancer are evident in most studies, probably as a consequence of long-term chronic inflammation. Probably, IBD are polygenic diseases sharing genes of sus-ceptibility for both of them (Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease), but with other specific different genes for each one. Among environmental risk factors described, smoking is the most important, with different behaviour in both diseases, though there have been described other associated risk factors like appendectomy, oral contraceptives, infections, diet, childhood hygiene, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory intake.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The functional outcome and quality of life after sphincter-saving operations for ulcerative colitis have not been previously assessed in Indian patients whose dietary habits and socio-cultural practices differ considerably from those in western countries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2002, we performed 46 J-pouch ileoanal anastomoses (IPAA), for patients with ulcerative colitis. Thirty-eight of these patients had had their ileostomy closure more than 4 years previously of whom 31 could be assessed by interviews and a telephonic questionnaire. Their quality of life was objectively assessed using the Cleveland Global Quality of Life (CGQL) index, a validated index for IPAA, the score being 1 in normal people. There were 20 males and 11 females with a mean age of 38 years. In the same period, six of the nine patients who did not opt to have an IPAA (permanent stoma) were assessed. These included four males and two females, mean age 45 years (36-52). RESULTS: One patient died in the postoperative period and another died 3 months after surgery from multiple small bowel perforations. Other complications included intestinal obstruction in seven, pouchitis in four and incisional hernia in two. One pouch had to be converted to a permanent ileostomy following development of a fistula because of Crohn's disease. The mean daily postoperative stool frequency was seven (range 2-20). Eighty-one percent had perfect daytime continence and 81% used dietary restrictions. Eighty-four percent rated their pouch function to be excellent or good. All patients preferred IPAA to an ileostomy citing mainly social and cultural reasons and were willing to choose it again. The mean preoperative CGQL score (0.27) increased significantly after colectomy (0.50) and after closure of ileostomy (0.77; p < 0.001). The mean CGQL in the "permanent stoma" group did not improve significantly after surgery (0.62 vs. 0.50) and four of these expressed a wish to have an IPAA. CONCLUSIONS: Restorative proctocolectomy provides a good functional outcome and improves the quality of life in Indians with ulcerative colitis and may be the most appropriate procedure for such patients in developing countries.},

   abstract = {Data from the literature suggest that the availability of the amino acids threonine, cysteine, or both, is limiting for mucin synthesis under conditions of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Unlike casein, cheese whey protein is rich in these amino acids. The protective effect of cheese whey protein was examined using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced inflammation of the large intestine in rats that were fed a diet containing casein, cheese whey protein, or casein supplemented with threonine and cysteine. The clinical markers diarrhea and fecal blood were determined using biochemical assays, and gene expression of inflammation markers was used to quantify inflammation. The effect of dairy protein on mucin production was determined by gene expression of rat mucin 2 (MUC2) and by quantifying fecal mucin excretion. Fecal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were determined using quantitative PCR. Dietary cheese whey protein reduced DSS-induced gene expression of the inflammation markers interleukin 1beta, calprotectin, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, and diminished the clinical symptoms diarrhea and fecal blood loss. Moreover, cheese whey protein increased fecal mucin secretion without affecting gene expression of MUC2, suggesting enhanced mucin synthesis. In addition, cheese whey protein increased fecal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria counts. Supplementation of threonine and cysteine showed comparable effects. In conclusion, cheese whey protein protected rats against DSS-induced gut inflammation. This can most likely be explained by its threonine and cysteine content. Protection can be the result of both the stimulation of intestinal mucin synthesis and modification of microflora composition.},

Unexpectedly, she developed episodes of hypoglycaemia, without any change in her usual medication (insulin NPH at bedtime and Metformin). Laboratory tests showed an improvement of endogenous insulin secretion as demonstrated by the induction of hypoglycaemia and the elevation to normalisation of C-peptide levels. The patient was rechallenged with dairy products, leading to the lowering of the C-peptide levels back to abnormal levels, and an increase in HBA1C levels. The findings in our patient contrast with the insulinotropic effect of milk in healthy subjects described in the literature. The two main "milk debates" on the relation between milk (or its components) and diabetes are presented. Further observations will be needed to clarify the question of whether a diet free of dairy products can improve glycaemic control in other insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients represent a high-risk group for enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) formation, related to both their disease process and the need for multiple surgeries. Often the abdominal wall is significantly involved with the ECF and requires partial resection. The use of synthetic prosthetic material to reconstruct the abdominal wall after ECF surgery is associated with increased risk of infection and recurrent fistulas. Herein we report the use human acellular dermal matrix (hADM) in the surgical treatment and reconstruction of the abdominal wall in 11 consecutive IBD patients with complex and medically refractory ECF. METHODS: After resection of the involved bowel segment and the overlying abdominal wall, a single sheet of hADM was used to reconstruct the defect. Pre- and perioperative risk factors were reviewed and patients were followed prospectively for a year (360 +/- 118 days). RESULTS: Operative mortality was nil. Three patients (27%) developed subcutaneous seroma and there were 2 cases (18%) of superficial wound infection, all of which resolved with conservative management. The mean length of hospital stay was 13.5 (+/-7.2) days and all patients were tolerating an oral diet at the time of dismissal. There were no recurrences. One patient with Crohn's disease developed a new ECF from a separate bowel site on postoperative day 145, which was treated with the same surgical approach. No further complications have occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that in a high-risk IBD patient population with multiple perioperative risk factors the use of hADM during ECF takedown is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option.},

An extract of the herb, HMPL-004, inhibits TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, and prevents colitis in animal models. AIM: To determine the efficacy and safety of HMPL-004 in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, multicentre, 8-week parallel group study was conducted using HMPL-004 1200 mg/day compared with 4500 mg/day of slow release mesalazine (mesalamine) granules in patients with mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis. Disease activity was assessed at baseline and every 2 weeks for clinical response, and at baseline and 8 weeks by colonoscopy. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients at five centres in China were randomised and dosed. Clinical remission and response were seen in 21% and 76% of HMPL-004-treated patients, and 16% and 82% of mesalazine-treated patients. By colonoscopy, remission and response were seen in 28% and 74% of HMPL-004-treated patients and 24% and 71% of mesalazine-treated patients, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: HMPL-004 may be an efficacious alternative to mesalazine in ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and 1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants. Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dietary linoleic acid, an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is metabolised to arachidonic acid, a component of colonocyte membranes. Metabolites of arachidonic acid have pro-inflammatory properties and are increased in the mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis. The aim of this investigation was to conduct the first prospective cohort study investigating if a high dietary intake of linoleic acid increases the risk of developing incident ulcerative colitis. DESIGN AND SETTING: Dietary data from food frequency questionnaires were available for 203 193 men and women aged 30-74 years, resident in the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Germany or Italy and participating in a prospective cohort study, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). These participants were followed up for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Each case was matched with four controls and the risk of disease calculated by quartile of intake of linoleic acid adjusted for gender, age, smoking, total energy intake and centre. RESULTS: A total of 126 participants developed ulcerative colitis (47% women) after a median follow-up of 4.0 years (range, 1.7-11.3 years). The highest quartile of intake of linoleic acid was associated with an increased risk of ulcerative colitis (odds ratio (OR) = 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.23 to 5.07, p = 0.01) with a significant trend across quartiles (OR = 1.32 per quartile increase, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.66, p = 0.02 for trend). CONCLUSIONS: The data support a role for dietary linoleic acid in the aetiology of ulcerative colitis. An estimated 30% of cases could be attributed to having dietary intakes higher than the lowest quartile of linoleic acid intake.},

Use of certain probiotic preparations is widespread and the number of clinical trials undertaken with such products is unparalleled in western scientific literature. One such preparation, containing a combination of Enterococcus faecium R0026 and Bacillus subtilis R0179, has 23 publications on post-market clinical studies involving over 1,800 adults. The majority of these publications are printed in Chinese and Korean journals. This review examines the clinical findings with this probiotic combination. As mono-therapy, it has been used to overcome symptoms associated with chronic diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome. It has been used as co-adjuvant therapy with sulfasalazine and mesalazine to improve remission times in mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis and to improve compliance with conventional triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication. While the much of the data is preliminary and the study designs require refinement, the contribution of these trials should not be ignored. The information derived in this review will provide practitioners with practical information on appropriate applications for probiotic supplements, expected outcomes, dosing regimes, safety and reported adverse events. Furthermore, identification of problems in these trials should help researchers design better clinical trials when investigating probiotic products.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are considered important pharmaconutrients for modulating mucosal immunity and therapeutic responses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We investigated the influence of diet therapy involving the use of an "n-3 PUFA food exchange table" (n-3DP) on the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membranes of IBD patients and its remission-maintaining effects. METHODS: We analyzed the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membrane before and after n-3DP intervention in 20 initial-onset IBD patients who had not undergone any dietary intervention. We then analyzed it again and evaluated disease activity after 12-18 months intervention in 230 IBD patients (168 ulcerative colitis, 62 Crohn's disease; follow-up group) in whom n-3DP was introduced after remission had been achieved. The follow-up group was divided into remission and relapse groups. RESULTS: In the 20 initial-onset patients, the mean n-3/n-6 ratio significantly increased after intervention (0.41 +/- 0.16 versus 0.70 +/- 0.20; P < 0.001). In the follow-up group the ratio in the remission group (n = 145) was significantly higher than that in the relapse group (n = 85) (0.65 +/- 0.28 versus 0.53 +/- 0.18; P < 0.001). The ratio significantly decreased in those who suffered a relapse after the beginning of treatment (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: N-3DP significantly increased the erythrocyte membrane n-3/n-6 ratio in IBD patients, and this ratio was significantly higher in the remission group, suggesting that n-3DP alters the fatty acid composition of the cell membrane and influences clinical activity in IBD patients.},

   abstract = {The Dutch national practice guideline 'Diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in adults' describes the multidisciplinary approach for adult patients with (suspected) IBD, recommended following analysis of the literature according to the principles of evidence based guideline development. The symptoms on first presentation of a patient with IBD are mainly connected with the localisation and severity of the disease and less with the resulting diagnosis 'Crohn's disease' or 'ulcerative colitis'. There is no test by which the diseases can be distinguished with certainty. Clinical course, ileocolonoscopy and histopathological investigation following biopsy form the 'gold standard' for diagnosis of IBD. The final diagnostic step is disease assessment according to the Montreal classification in order to enable unambiguous communication with medical professionals. The first aim of treatment is to treat and stabilise active disease (induction therapy); at the same time maintenance therapy is initiated. A step-up approach is recommended for both treatment aims. Surgical intervention is indicated if the medical treatment is ineffective, in case of intractable gastrointestinal bleeding, in clinically significant gastrointestinal stenosis due to fibrotic scar tissue, or if complications of the inflammation occur such as abscess, peritonitis, or complicated fistula formation. Nutrition and diet do not play a primary therapeutic role in treatment of adult patients with IBD. However, supportive nutritional care is warranted. Probiotics have a demonstrable effect in preventing pouchitis, but not in the treatment of IBD. Alternative medicine has no role to play in the treatment of IBD. The risk of developing colorectal carcinoma is slightly elevated in IBD patients. Therefore, endoscopic surveillance strategies, aimed at early detection of dysplasia, is indicated according to a schedule in which the frequency increases according to the time elapsed since first clinical signs of IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: High-fat diets have been shown to be a risk factor for ulcerative colitis (UC). Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are considered to increase lipid peroxidation, while the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid exerts a chemopreventative effect. We evaluated the effect of high-fat diets (20%) enriched with fish or soybean oil on colonic inflammation and DNA damage in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (28-30 days) were fed an American Institute of Nutrition (AIN)-93 diet for 47 days and divided into five groups: control normal fat non-colitic (C) or control colitis (CC), high soybean fat group (HS) colitis, high fish fat group colitis, or high-fat soybean plus fish oil colitis. UC was induced from day 35 until day 41 by 3% dextran sulfate sodium. On day 47, the rats were anesthetized; blood samples collected for corticosterone determination, and the distal colon was excised to quantify interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-10, and interferon-gamma levels, myeloperoxidase activity, histological analyses, and DNA damage. The disease activity index was recorded daily. RESULTS: The disease activity index, histological analysis, myeloperoxidase activity, IL-4, interferon-gamma, and corticosterone levels did not differ among the colitic groups. IL-10 was significantly increased by the high fish fat group diet in relation to HS, but only the high soybean-fish fat diet increased the IL-10/IL-4 ratio (anti-inflammatory/pro-inflammatory) to levels closer to the C group and reduced DNA damage compared to the HS group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The data show that high-fat diets did not exacerbate UC and suggest that the soybean and fish oil mixture, more than the fish oil alone, could be a complementary therapy to achieve a cytokine balance in UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anaemia represents a common complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Most studies on anaemia in IBD patients have been performed in tertiary referral centres (RC) and data from gastroenterologic practices (GP) are lacking. We investigated the frequency and severity of anaemia in IBD patients from tertiary referral centres and gastroenterologic practices compared to the general population. METHODS: Data were acquired from patients included in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study. IBD activity was evaluated by CDAI and modified Truelove and Witts severity index (MTWSI). Anaemia was defined as haemoglobin </=120g/L in women and </=130g/L in men. RESULTS: 125 patients from RC (66 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 59 with ulcerative colitis (UC)) and 116 patients from GP (71 CD and 45 UC) were included and compared to 6074 blood donors. Anaemia was found in 21.2% (51/241) of the IBD patients and more frequently in patients from RC as compared to GP and healthy controls (28.8% vs. 12.9% vs. 3.4%; P<0.01). IBD patients from RC suffered more frequently from active disease compared to IBD patients in GP (36% vs. 23%, P=0.032). Supplementation therapy (iron, vitamin B12, folic acid) was performed in 40% of anaemic IBD patients in GP as compared to 43% in RC. CONCLUSIONS: Anaemia is a common complication in patients with IBD and significantly more prevalent in patients from referral centres as compared to patients from gastroenterologic practices. Physicians treating IBD patients should pay attention to the presence of anaemia and ensure sufficient supplementation therapy.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammation is strongly associated with approximately 1/5th of all human cancers. Arising from combinations of factors such as environmental exposures, diet, inherited gene polymorphisms, infections, or from dysfunctions of the immune response, chronic inflammation begins as an attempt of the body to remove injurious stimuli; however, over time, this results in continuous tissue destruction and promotion and maintenance of carcinogenesis. Here we focus on intestinal inflammation and its associated cancers, a group of diseases on the rise and affecting millions of people worldwide. Intestinal inflammation can be widely grouped into inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) and celiac disease. Long-standing intestinal inflammation is associated with colorectal cancer and small-bowel adenocarcinoma, as well as extraintestinal manifestations, including lymphomas and autoimmune diseases. This article highlights potential mechanisms of pathogenesis in inflammatory bowel diseases and celiac disease, as well as those involved in the progression to associated cancers, most of which have been identified from studies utilizing mouse models of intestinal inflammation. Mouse models of intestinal inflammation can be widely grouped into chemically induced models; genetic models, which make up the bulk of the studied models; adoptive transfer models; and spontaneous models. Studies in these models have lead to the understanding that persistent antigen exposure in the intestinal lumen, in combination with loss of epithelial barrier function, and dysfunction and dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. Transcriptional changes in this environment leading to cell survival, hyperplasia, promotion of angiogenesis, persistent DNA damage, or insufficient repair of DNA damage due to an excess of proinflammatory mediators are then thought to lead to sustained malignant transformation. With regards to extraintestinal manifestations such as lymphoma, however, more suitable models are required to further investigate the complex and heterogeneous mechanisms that may be at play.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Distinguishing between the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) is important for both management and prognostic reasons. Discrimination using noninvasive techniques could be an adjunct to conventional diagnostics. Differences have been shown between the intestinal microbiota of CD and UC patients and controls; the gut bacteria influence specific urinary metabolites that are quantifiable using proton high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This study tested the hypothesis that such metabolites differ between IBD and control cohorts, and that using multivariate pattern-recognition analysis, the cohorts could be distinguished by urine NMR spectroscopy. METHODS: NMR spectra were acquired from urine samples of 206 Caucasian subjects (86 CD patients, 60 UC patients, and 60 healthy controls). Longitudinal samples were collected from 75 individuals. NMR resonances specific for metabolites influenced by the gut microbes were studied, including hippurate, formate, and 4-cresol sulfate. Multivariate analysis of all urinary metabolites involved principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). RESULTS: Hippurate levels were lowest in CD patients and differed significantly between the three cohorts (P<0.0001). Formate levels were higher and 4-cresol sulfate levels lower in CD patients than in UC patients or controls (P=0.0005 and P=0.0002, respectively). PCA revealed clustering of the groups; PLS-DA modeling was able to distinguish the cohorts. These results were independent of medication and diet and were reproducible in the longitudinal cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Specific urinary metabolites related to gut microbial metabolism differ between CD patients, UC patients, and controls. The emerging technique of urinary metabolic profiling with multivariate analysis was able to distinguish these cohorts.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The pharmacology, uses, dosages, safety, drug interactions, and contraindications of probiotics are reviewed. SUMMARY: Probiotics are live nonpathogenic microorganisms administered to improve microbial balance, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. They consist of Saccharomyces boulardii yeast or lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, and are regulated as dietary supplements and foods. Probiotics exert their beneficial effects through various mechanisms, including lowering intestinal pH, decreasing colonization and invasion by pathogenic organisms, and modifying the host immune response. Probiotic benefits associated with one species or strain do not necessarily hold true for others. The strongest evidence for the clinical effectiveness of probiotics has been in the treatment of acute diarrhea, most commonly due to rotavirus, and pouchitis. More research is needed to clarify the role of probiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection, travelers' diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and vulvovaginal candidiasis. There is no consensus about the minimum number of microorganisms that must be ingested to obtain a beneficial effect; however, a probiotic should typically contain several billion microorganisms to increase the chance that adequate gut colonization will occur. Probiotics are generally considered safe and well tolerated, with bloating and flatulence occurring most frequently. They should be used cautiously in patients who are critically ill or severely immunocompromised or those with central venous catheters since systemic infections may rarely occur. Bacteria-derived probiotics should be separated from antibiotics by at least two hours. CONCLUSION: Probiotics have demonstrated efficacy in preventing and treating various medical conditions, particularly those involving the gastrointestinal tract. Data supporting their role in other conditions are often conflicting.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence base for the medical (pharmaceutical and nutritional) treatment of paediatric inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Key clinical questions were formulated regarding different treatment modalities used in the treatment of paediatric (not adult-onset) IBD, in particular the induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. Electronic searches were performed from January 1966 to December 2006, using the electronic search strategy of the Cochrane IBD group. Details of papers were entered on a dedicated database, reviewed in abstract form, and disseminated in full for appraisal. Clinical guidelines were appraised using the AGREE instrument and all other relevant papers were appraised using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology, with evidence levels given to all papers. RESULTS: A total of 6285 papers were identified, of which 1255 involved children; these were entered on the database. After critical appraisal, only 103 publications met our criteria as evidence on medical treatment of paediatric IBD. We identified 3 clinical guidelines, 1 systematic review, and 16 randomised controlled trials; all were of variable quality, with none getting the highest methodological scores. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive review of the evidence base for the treatment of paediatric IBD, highlighting the paucity of trials of high methodological quality. As a result, the development of clinical guidelines for managing children and young people with IBD must be consensus based, informed by the best-available evidence from the paediatric literature and high-quality data from the adult IBD literature, together with the clinical expertise and multidisciplinary experience of paediatric IBD experts.},

Significant deficits in height and weight in children with Crohn's disease have been reported but changes in fat and fat free mass are less well defined. This study aims to describe the height, weight and body composition of a cohort of children with IBD. METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. Disease activity was assessed with clinical scoring systems. RESULTS: 55 children, median age 13.7 years (range 6.5-17.7) were studied. Median (25th, 75th percentile) Standard Deviation Score for BMI, Height and Weight were - 0.3 (- 0.97, 0.65), - 0.56 (- 1.42, 0.06), - 0.62 (- 1.43, 0.19). In Crohn's disease, using multiple regression analysis disease activity measured by PCDAI was significantly inversely related to fat free mass (beta - 0.2, 95% CI -0.17, -0.03, p 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBD were both under and overweight. Nutritional deficits were more common in Crohn's disease. Fat free mass was related to disease activity in children with Crohn's disease regardless of changes in weight. Weight or BMI may mask deficits in lean tissue in the presence of normal or increased proportions of body fat.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The experimental data show that in mucosal injury of the alimentary system serotonin metabolism and secretion is disturbed. Such suggestions are also drawn in discussions concerning pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. THE AIM OF THE STUDY: To perform a quantitative evaluation of 24-hour urine excretion of a major serotonin metabolite-5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The studied group comprised 50 patients with exacerbated UC, aged 21-56 years. Among them 25 had mild and 25 severe exacerbation according to Trulove's and Witts criteria. The control group comprised 25 healthy persons. On the study day the patients remained on standard liquid diet--Nutrdrink 3 x 400 ml with the caloric value of 1800 kcal. 5-HIAA concentration was measured by ELISA method applying IBL antibodies (RE 59131), and the results were presented in mg/dl and then the value of 24-hour urine excretion was calculated. Results. In the group o patients with severely exacerbated UC 5-HIAA excretion was significantly lower that in healthy volunteers--1.66 +/- 0.98 mg/24 hi 5.77 +/- 0.46 mg/24 respectively (p < 0.05). The results of 5-HIAA excretion showed positive correlation with serum albumin concentration. In the group of patients with mild colitis such significant changes and correlations were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: (1) In severe exacerbations of UC serotonin metabolism is largely changed. (2) 24-hour serotonin excretion can have a predictive value in UC.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Crohn's disease is established in laparoscopic surgery due to partial bowel dissection and low postoperative complication rate. However, laparoscopic surgery for ulcerative colitis remains further discussed even if the trend of minimally invasive technique exists. This study is to figure out how laparoscopic surgery works for ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Sixteen controlled trials were identified through the search strategy mentioned below. There was only one prospective randomized study among the studies selected. A meta-analysis pooled the outcome effects of laparoscopic surgery and open surgery was performed. Fixed effect model or random effect model was respectively used depending on the heterogeneity test of trials. RESULTS: Postoperative fasting time and postoperative hospital stay were shorter in laparoscopic surgery for ulcerative colitis (-1.37 [-2.15, -0.58], -3.22 [-4.20, -2.24], respectively, P < 0.05). Overall complication rate was higher in open surgery, compared with laparoscopic surgery (54.8% versus 39.3%, P = 0.004). However, duration of laparoscopic surgery for ulcerative colitis was extended compared with open surgery (weighted mean difference 69.29 min, P = 0.04). As to recovery of bowel function, peritoneal abscess, anastomotic leakage, postoperative bowel obstruction, wound infection, blood loss, and mortality, laparoscopic surgery did not show any superiority over open surgery. Re-operation rate was almost even (5.2% versus 7.3%). The whole conversion to open surgery was 4.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery for ulcerative colitis was at least as safe as open surgery, even better in postoperative fasting time, postoperative hospital stay, and overall complication rate. However, clinical value of laparoscopic surgery for ulcerative colitis needed further evaluation with more well-designed and long-term follow-up studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Guaiac tests are the most widely used tests to detect colorectal cancer (CRC). However, their sensitivity is relatively low and results may be affected by various factors. Immunofecal occult blood test (IFOBT) is specific for human hemoglobin and does not require dietary restrictions. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of IFOBT for the screening of precancerous lesions and CRC. METHODS: From July 2006 to June 2007, IFOBT was performed on 5,919 adults who received periodic health examinations in our hospital. The positive cases were examined by colonoscopy and a double-contrast barium enema. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological analysis. RESULTS: Positive IFOBT was detected in 314 of 5,919 cases (5.30%). Further examinations were made in 264 IFOBT-positive cases. Of these, 116 cases with colorectal cancer (16 cases) or precancerous lesions (94 cases with colorectal adenomatous polyps and 6 cases with active ulcerative colitis) were detected. The total detection rate of CRC and precancerous lesions was 43.94% (116/264). TNM classification of 16 CRC cases was as follows: TNM I in eight cases (50.00%), TNM II in seven cases (43.75%) and TNM III in one case (6.25%), indicating IFOBT can detect CRC in the early stages. CONCLUSION: Regular IFOBT can detect precancerous lesions and CRC in early stages and can thus reduce mortality from CRC.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Coeliac disease (gluten enteropathy) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of autoimmune etiology in genetically predisposed individuals. It is the most frequent enteropathy with frequency of 1/100 and 1/300 in the adult population in America and Europe respectively. Typical form of celiac disease including abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea is quite rare in adults. In some coeliac patients, symptoms persist in spite of strict gluten free diet. One of the reasons of this is interference of the autoimmune diseases. Results of our studies revealed in the group of 110 patients with diagnosed gluten enteropathy, coexistence of autoimmune disease, such as diabetes mellitus type 1 in 7.2% cases, hyperthyreosis on 1.8% of cases, vitiligo in 0.9% of cases, primary biliary cirrhosis in 2% of cases and rheumatoidal arthritis in 0,9 of cases. In the group of 80 ulcerative colitis patients, coexistence of celiac disease basing on serological histopatological investigation was found in 4 patients (5%). CONCLUSIONS: Coexistence of coeliac disease with other autoimmune diseases is quite frequent. Gluten enteropathy symptoms may be interpreted as originating from other autoimmune disease. It can delay the diagnosis of celiac disease and introduction of gluten free diet, which improves the quality of life and protects from dangerous GI complications.},
