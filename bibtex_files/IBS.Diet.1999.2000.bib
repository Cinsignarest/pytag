Research has demonstrated no causal relationship between psychosocial factors and the development of IBS. IBS cannot be diagnosed through radiologic, endoscopic or laboratory studies because the symptoms are not explained by structural or chemical abnormalities. One of the most important components of treatment is the development of an effective provider patient relationship. Behavioral treatments may be helpful in select patients. Dietary management can also reduce symptoms if the patient can identify foods that trigger them.},

   abstract = {There have frequently been doubts as to the relevance of food allergy, in particular as far as the involvement of the intestinal tract is concerned. Several studies, however, have confirmed the existence of allergic reactions in the gut, with an estimated prevalence of about 1-2% in adults. Clinical symptoms are unspecific and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping and diarrhea. Intestinal mast cells, as well as intestinal eosinophils, have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of food-allergy-related enteropathy. In addition to classical IgE-dependent degranulation, further agonists have been demonstrated for mast cell activation, for example IL-4. The methods used to confirm the diagnosis of intestinal allergy are still insufficient. Until now, blinded oral challenge procedures with food antigens have been accepted as the 'gold standard' in diagnosing food allergy, although these tests have practical problems. Therefore, new test systems have been developed, such as endoscopic provocation tests, that may improve diagnostic procedures. Elimination diet still presents the main basis of therapy. Aspects to be focused on in the future are the role fo IgE-independent allergic mechanisms in intestinal allergy, the impact of cross-reactivity with other allergens and the relationship to other inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome.},

This study describes the modifications of CRF induced by treatment with oral pinaverium bromide in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Thirty healthy subjects and 43 patients suffering from IBS were studied. Colonic transit time (CTT) was measured in fasting conditions and after eating a standard test meal. Colonic response to food was quantified by calculating the variation in number of markers in each zone of interest of the large bowel between the X-ray films of the abdomen taken before and after eating. CRF is characterized by caudal propulsion of colonic contents in the two groups. In controls, there is emptying of the caecum-ascending colon region and filling of the rectosigmoid. In IBS patients, only the left transverse colon and the splenic flexure empty. Pinaverium bromide exerts no effect in controls but reverses the CRF of the right colon in IBS patients by inhibiting right colon emptying. These results suggest that the inhibitory action of pinaverium bromide on CRF may support the clinical efficacy of this calcium channel blocker in the treatment of IBS.},

Further trials with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are awaited. Psychological treatments including hypnotherapy are less widely available but may play an important role in the relief of pain. In summary, current therapies targeted on the predominant symptoms in IBS are moderately successful. As the bowel sensorimotor and limbic system disturbances of IBS are more clearly understood, we should anticipate other pharmacologic approaches in the near future, including alpha-adrenergic agonists and 5-HT4 agonists. New therapies directed at treatment of the syndrome, rather than relief of symptoms, are needed.},

Alosetron concentration-dependently inhibited radioligand binding in membranes containing rat and human 5-HT3 receptors with estimated pKi values of 9.8 (n = 3) and 9.4 (n = 6), respectively. In selectivity studies alosetron had little or no significant affinity for any of the many other receptors and ion channels studied. Alosetron potently antagonized the depolarization produced by 5-HT in the rat vagus nerve (estimated pKB value of 9.8, n = 25). In anaesthetized rats, i. v. administration of alosetron inhibited 2-methyl-5-HT induced bradycardia (Bezold Jarisch index) at 1 and 3 microg kg-1, with an agonist dose ratio of approximately 3.0 at 1.0 microg kg-1, = 3-5). Alosetron administered via the duodenum also inhibited this reflex, with duration of action that was significantly longer than that seen with ondansetron (120-60 min, respectively, n = 6). Alosetron had no significant effect on normal small intestinal propulsion in the rat, but fully reversed the increase in intestinal propulsion (96%, n = 3) produced by egg albumin challenge. Alosetron is a highly selective 5-HT3 antagonist which normalizes perturbed small intestinal propulsion. Previous clinical data in IBS patients together with the transit data provide a good rationale for further studies with alosetron in IBS patients.},

The aim of this pilot study was to assess its efficacy as a treatment for diarrhoea in 11 patients, all of whom had irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea as a feature. METHODS: The patients were interviewed and a questionnaire completed on entry into the trial. They then took 10 mL arrowroot powder three times a day for one month and discontinued the treatment for the subsequent month. Questionnaires were completed after one month on treatment and at the end of the trial after one month off treatment. RESULTS: Arrowroot reduced diarrhoea and had a long-term effect on constipation. It also eased abdominal pain. CONCLUSION: Arrowroot is an effective treatment for diarrhoea. Its action could be explained by several theories which relate to an increase in faecal bulk and thus a more efficient bowel action. The number of patients was small, and further studies are needed to substantiate preliminary results.},

Bowel sounds from irritable bowel patients and normal controls were digitized using an electronic stethoscope. Computerized analysis indicated that the character of the bowel sounds did not differ significantly between groups. However, the fasting sound-to-sound interval was significantly different between groups (1931 +/- 365 msec for normals and 452 +/- 35 msec for the irritable bowel group; P = 0.0001). Using the sound-to-sound interval as a test for irritable bowel syndrome, the cutoff value of 640 msec resulted in a sensitivity of 89%, and a specificity of 100%. We conclude that computerized analysis of bowel sounds has the potential to be a noninvasive, quantitative, and objective test providing positive criteria in the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome.},

The authors evaluated the effects of oral nutritional supplementation on the morphology and immunology of the intestinal mucosa of patients with AIDS. Twelve patients with AIDS without diarrhea or opportunistic infections, with at least 10% of body weight loss over 1 year, were submitted to anthropometric measures, peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts, and peroral jejunal biopsy before and after oral nutritional supplementation. An industrialized peptide-based formula containing omega-3 fatty acids was given for 6 weeks. Jejunal samples were analyzed by histomorphometry, including villous-to-crypt ratio, lamina propria, and intraepithelial lymphocyte count. Immunologic assessment of the intestinal mucosa was made by indirect immunoperoxidase using monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD4, and CD8. Seven patients with irritable bowel syndrome and two healthy volunteers were selected as a control group for histologic and immunohistochemical comparisons. After 6 weeks the patient group maintained their body weight and increased their tricipital fold. The number of peripheral blood T cells, albumin, transferrin, and the number of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells in jejunal mucosa as well as the intestinal morphometry remained stable. Oral supplementation contributed to maintaining body weight and may constitute a reasonable adjuvant therapeutic tool against AIDS progression.},

Preliminary data suggested equivalent value from a specially devised audiotape. Tape use is now compared with gut-directed hyponotherapy in a randomised controlled trial. Consenting patients (n = 52; 37 women) with established IBS were recruited to a 12-week study. All had failed dietary and pharmacological therapy. The median age was 37 years (range 19-71); median symptom duration was 60 months (8-480). Randomisation was to six sessions of individual hypnotherapy, or to the tape, with stratification according to predominant symptom. Symptom scores and validated psychological questionnaires were utilised. Twenty-five patients (18 women) received hypnotherapy, 27 the tape. Successful trance was induced in all hypnotherapy patients. By intention to treat, symptom scores improved in 76% of hypnotherapy patients and in 59% of tape patients (not significant). Amongst 45 patients providing a full set of symptom scores there was advantage to hypnotherapy, with a reduction in median score from 14 to 8.5 compared to an unchanged score of 13 in audiotape patients (P < 0.05). The assessor considered 52% in each group to have improved. Those with greater initial anxiety tended to be more compliant and more likely to respond. Gut-directed hypnotherapy and audiotapes appear valuable in resistant IBS. Although probably inferior to hypnotherapy, the ease and economy of tape use may be considered sufficient to recommend it as a second-line option in IBS, reserving hypnotherapy for failures.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carbohydrate malabsorption of lactose, fructose and sorbitol has already been described in normal volunteers and in patients with functional bowel complaints including irritable bowel syndrome. Elimination of the offending sugar(s) should result in clinical improvement. OBJECTIVE: To examine the importance of carbohydrate malabsorption in outpatients previously diagnosed as having functional bowel disorders, and to estimate the degree of clinical improvement following dietary restriction of the malabsorbed sugar(s). METHODS: A cohort of 239 patients defined as functional bowel complaints was divided into a group of 94 patients who met the Rome criteria for irritable bowel syndrome and a second group of 145 patients who did not fulfill these criteria and were defined as functional complaints. Lactose (18 g), fructose (25 g) and a mixture of fructose (25 g) plus sorbitol (5 g) solutions were administered at weekly intervals. End-expiratory hydrogen and methane breath samples were collected at 30 minute intervals for 4 hours. Incomplete absorption was defined as an increment in breath hydrogen of at least 20 ppm, or its equivalent in methane of at least 5 ppm. All patients received a diet without the offending sugar(s) for one month. RESULTS: Only 7% of patients with IBS and 8% of patients with FC absorbed all three sugars normally. The frequency of isolated lactose malabsorption was 16% and 12% respectively. The association of lactose and fructose-sorbitol malabsorption occurred in 61% of both patient groups. The frequency of sugar malabsorption among patients in both groups was 78% for lactose malabsorption (IBS 82%, FC 75%), 44% for fructose malabsorption and 73% for fructose-sorbitol malabsorption (IBS 70%, FC 75%). A marked improvement occurred in 56% of IBS and 60% of FC patients following dietary restriction. The number of symptoms decreased significantly in both groups (P < 0.01) and correlated with the improvement index (IBS P < 0.05, FC P < 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Combined sugar malabsorption patterns are common in functional bowel disorders and may contribute to symptomatology in most patients. Dietary restriction of the offending sugar(s) should be implemented before the institution of drug therapy.},

METHODS: Children who had abdominal pain associated with defecation or change in bowel habit, disordered defecation, and distension were diagnosed with IBS, and lactose maldigestion was defined by lactose breath hydrogen testing. Children with IBS were managed with increased fiber intake, while those with lactose maldigestion restricted dietary lactose. A telephone survey was conducted to determine the response to treatment. RESULTS: The mean age of the 59 boys and 87 girls was 9.5 +/- 3.0 years. Children with IBS and lactose maldigestion had more frequent abdominal pain than children without these conditions, but they required less medication for relief of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS. Lactose maldigestion may be a contributory factor in children with IBS, and lactose avoidance in these patients may reduce medication use to relieve symptoms.},

METHODS: References were searched on recent review articles, personal files, and Medline. RESULTS: Irritable bowel syndrome in children or chronic nonspecific diarrhea is a very frequent reason for pediatric gastroenterology visits. It is a benign disease and disappears with age, but may cause extreme worry to parents. The pathophysiology is still unclear, and there is not laboratory corroboration. Thus, it is frequently diagnosed incorrectly, although it has proper clinical manifestation (if there is no diet or medicine manipulation). Dietary advice is usually efficient, and is based on pathophysiologic data. The use of drug is still discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Irritable bowel syndrome must be always considered in oligosymptomatic children without signs of malnutrition, with diarrhea, between 6 months and 5 years of age. Drugs are not necessary, and their action is still unclear. Food manipulation based on pathophysiology is enough.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fructose malabsorption is characterized by the inability to absorb fructose efficiently. As a consequence fructose reaches the colon where it is broken down by bacteria to short fatty acids, CO2 and H2. Bloating, cramps, osmotic diarrhea and other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are the consequences and can be seen in about 50% of fructose malabsorbers. We have previously shown that fructose malabsorption is associated with early signs of mental depression and low serum tryptophan concentrations. It was therefore of interest whether a fructose-reduced diet could not only improve gastrointestinal complaints but also depressive signs seen in fructose malabsorbers. METHODS: Fifty-three adults (12 males, 41 females), who were identified as fructose malabsorbers according to their breath-H2 concentrations, filled out a Beck's depression inventory-questionnaire, and a questionnaire with arbitrary scales for measurement of meteorism, stool frequency and quality of life for a 4-week period before dietary intervention and 4 weeks after dietary change as for fructose- and sorbitol-reduced diet. RESULTS: Depression scores were reduced by 65.2% after 4 weeks of diet (P < 0.0001), and there was a significant reduction of meteorism (P < 0.0001) and stool frequency (P < 0.01). Improvement of signs of depression and of meteorism was more pronounced in females than in males. CONCLUSION: Fructose- and sorbitol-reduced diet in subjects with fructose malabsorption does not only reduce gastrointestinal symptoms but also improves mood and early signs of depression.},

   abstract = {Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a chronic recurring disorder with variable illness episodes that may continue for many years. Diagnosis is based on symptoms such as abdominal pain and irregular bowel habits. These symptoms, plus the influence of psychological factors and extraintestinal symptoms, adversely affect the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of individuals with IBS. This paper summarizes publications relating to the characteristics of IBS and associated HRQoL. Significantly lower scores on both the physical and mental health scales of the Short Form-36 are reported for individuals with IBS symptoms as compared with asymptomatic controls and US norms. IBS negatively affects general health, vitality, social functioning, bodily pain, diet, sexual function, sleep, and is associated with lost time from work. IBS-specific instruments that incorporate many of these domains have recently become available. HRQoL appears to correlate with IBS symptom severity and influences decisions to seek medical care. Psychosocial problems are also linked with IBS in relation to health care utilization. However, the full burden of this painful illness is still unknown since only 25-60% of individuals suffering from IBS symptoms see a physician for their illness.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The value of specific gastrointestinal symptoms in discriminating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) from organic disease has been documented. In contrast, there have been few attempts to identify symptoms that discriminate irritable bowel syndrome from food allergy, despite similarities in their respective symptom complexes. We aimed to investigate the value of symptoms in discriminating irritable bowel syndrome from organic disease and food allergy. METHODS: Subjects (n = 288) were recruited from consecutive patients presenting to the Internal Medicine, Gastroenterology and Allergy Units in Chieti. Patients completed the validated Bowel Disease Questionnaire (BDQ) prior to an independent diagnostic evaluation, which included endoscopy when appropriate. Food allergy was diagnosed using a 2-week elimination diet, followed by a placebo-controlled food challenge test, a skin prick test and serum RAST for specific IgE for suspected foods or additives. The results of the BDQ were not considered in formulating a diagnosis. In total, 99 patients were diagnosed with the IBS, 79 patients were diagnosed with organic disease and 22 patients were diagnosed with food allergy. A further 88 patients with extraintestinal allergies were included as a control group. RESULTS: Based on logistic regression analysis, six symptom items discriminated IBS from organic disease, while five symptoms discriminated patients with IBS from control subjects. A diagnosis of IBS compared to organic disease was positively associated with straining on defaecation (P=0.0001), diarrhoea (P=0.001) and abdominal bloating (P=0.01), but was negatively associated with pain in the upper abdomen (P=0.0004), reflux (P=0.0001) and appetite loss (P=0.004). A diagnosis of IBS compared to extraintestinal allergy was positively associated with pain relieved by bowel movement (P=0.0001), pain in the lower abdomen (P=0.0006), pain in both the upper and lower abdomen (P=0.003), frequent pain (P=0.001) and abdominal bloating (P=0.0009). In comparison between IBS and food allergy patients, a diagnosis of IBS was positively associated with pain in the lower abdomen (P=0.001), pain relieved by bowel movements (P=0.001), frequent pain (P=0.02) and abdominal bloating (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Symptoms appear to be useful for discriminating IBS from organic gastrointestinal disease and food allergy.},

Our aim was to identify the information needs, levels and associated factors in IBS, and to contrast this with patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). DESIGN: Seventy adult IBS patients (Rome criteria) were prospectively recruited, together with 82 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 60 Crohn's disease (CD) patients. Demographic data, clinical data, and anxiety and depression scores (HAD scale) were recorded. Patients rated their perceived levels of disease knowledge and satisfaction with their knowledge level on visual analogue scales. Qualitative data on disease information needs were obtained by an open-ended question. SETTING: Gastroenterology out-patient clinic. RESULTS: The majority of IBS patients (77%; n = 54) and over half of IBD patients (56%; n = 79) required further information about their disease. The primary issues for IBS patients were bowel cancer risk and diet. Queries about medications ranked top for UC, while prognosis and cancer risk jointly ranked top for CD. In the IBS group, 27% rated their knowledge as < 25 out of 100 compared to 10% of IBD patients. The perceived level of knowledge in IBS was significantly negatively associated with length of hospital consulting (r(s) = -0.32; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Most IBS patients feel insufficiently informed, particularly in relation to risk of serious disease and role of diet. Educating IBS patients about their disorder may play a role in reducing healthcare use.},

Five working groups comprising family physicians, gastroenterologists and allied health care professionals from across Canada were then charged with developing recommendations for the diagnosis, patient education, psychosocial management, dietary advice and pharmacotherapy, respectively. An evidence-based approach was used where possible; otherwise, recommendations were made by consensus. The participants concluded that family physicians can make a positive diagnosis of IBS using symptom criteria. The pathophysiology is poorly understood, but motility and sensory disturbances appear to play a role. Neither psychological nor specific dietary factors cause IBS, but both can trigger symptoms. Drug therapy is not recommended for the routine treatment of IBS, but short-term trials of drug therapy may be targeted to predominant symptoms in selected patients. A step-wise, patient-centred approach to management is outlined.},

We evaluated the effect of a cold pressor test (CPT)--hand immersion in ice water for 1 minute, which evokes a sympathetic response--on rectosigmoid motility in patients with IBS and normal volunteers. Since many Indian patients with IBS complain of worsening of symptoms following a spicy meal, we also evaluated whether a high-chilli diet affects symptoms or changes rectosigmoid motility. METHODS: Fifteen men with IBS and 13 normal volunteers (all men) were studied. Baseline rectosigmoid manometry was done for 2 h, i.e., 1 h pre- and 1 h post-CPT. The subjects were then kept in hospital on a regular diet (approximately 5 g chilli daily) for 3 days, following which symptoms were reassessed and manometry repeated for 1 h. This was followed by a high-chilli diet (approximately 15 g/day) for 3 days, after which symptoms were reassessed and manometry repeated for 1 h. RESULTS: There was no difference in the baseline study in the pre-CPT period between patients and control subjects. CPT did not change rectosigmoid motility in either group. IBS patients had varied effect on symptoms but no change in rectosigmoid motility after the high-chilli diet. In the normal volunteers, there was increased activity in the low rectum after the high-chilli diet. CONCLUSIONS: Cold pressor test does not affect rectosigmoid motility in patients with IBS or normal subjects. A high-chilli diet has varied effect on symptoms in patients with IBS and does not affect rectosigmoid motility.},

   abstract = {Lactose malabsorption and lactase deficiency are chronic organic pathologic conditions characterized by abdominal pain and distention, flatulence, and the passage of loose, watery stools. Though malabsorption of the sugar lactose is determinable by breath hydrogen test or jejunal biopsy, intolerance can only be confirmed by challenge with lactose-containing food, the response to which may not be immediate. The difficulty of making a positive diagnosis of these conditions has led to a proportion of lactose-intolerant patients being misdiagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which has a remarkably similar symptom complex and for which there is no current pathophysiologic marker. The incidence of the two disorders is approximately equal, but the actual proportion of patients with IBS incorrectly diagnosed in this way varies as a function of the methodology used. Once correct diagnosis is established, introduction of a lactose-free dietary regime relieves symptoms in most patients. Symptom similarity and the resultant incorrect diagnosis of IBS may explain the refractory nature of some patients labeled as IBS who remain largely unaware of the relationship between food intake and symptoms.},

   abstract = {Although there is a wide variability in symptoms, disorders of colonic motility are the most prominent features in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Stool weight is within the normal range but many patients appear to have abnormal rectal sensations. Straining even with soft stool is common. Dietary fibre stimulates ileocolonic flow and may induce more symptoms in IBS than normal. There is evidence of increased responsiveness of the IBS colon, both to the effect of eating and to stress. Defaecatory disorders are common and may reflect both increased or decreased rectal sensitivity. The normal colon is quiescent during sleep, but in IBS coma sleep is often abnormal, with more periods of arousal and the colon consequently more active. There is evidence of increased responsiveness to corticotrophin releasing factor, which mediates much of the effect of stress on the gut. Many patients show a sympathetic/vagal imbalance with relative excess of sympathetic influence in keeping with increased levels of psychological stress and anxiety. There is undoubtedly more than one cause of IBS and around 25% appear to develop symptoms after an infectious enteritis. This has effects on the entero-endocrine system which may take many years to subside.},

   abstract = {One of the most topical areas of human nutrition is the role of the gut in health and disease. Specifically, this involves interactions between the resident microbiota and dietary ingredients that support their activities. Currently, it is accepted that the gut microflora contains pathogenic, benign and beneficial components. Some microbially induced disease states such as acute gastroenteritis and pseudomembranous colitis have a defined aetiological agent(s). Speculation on the role of microbiota components in disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, bowel cancer, neonatal necrotising enterocolitis and ulcerative colitis are less well defined, but many studies are convincing. It is evident that the gut microflora composition can be altered through diet. Because of their perceived health-promoting status, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are the commonest targets. Probiotics involve the use of live micro-organisms in food; prebiotics are carbohydrates selectively metabolized by desirable moieties of the indigenous flora; synbiotics combine the two approaches. Dietary intervention of the human gut microbiota is feasible and has been proven as efficacious in volunteer trials. The health bonuses of such approaches offer the potential to manage many gut disorders prophylactically. However, it is imperative that the best methodologies available are applied to this area of nutritional sciences. This will undoubtedly involve a genomic application to the research and is already under way through molecular tracking of microbiota changes to diet in controlled human trials.},

Ingestion of pancreatic supplements was associated with a significant (P = 0.049) reduction in bloating over the entire recording period, and with significant reductions in bloating, gas, and fullness during the dinner to bedtime period. Pancreatic supplements had no significant effect on breath H2 or CH4 concentration. The finding that pancreatic supplements reduce postprandial symptoms in healthy subjects suggests that these supplements also might be beneficial in irritable bowel syndrome.},

In any patient complaining of chronic or recurrent abdominal pain, chronic diarrhoea or constipation or bloating, IBS should top the list of possibilities. OBJECTIVE: To outline an approach to the practical management of patients with IBS. DISCUSSION: A positive diagnosis can be made if a few simple questions are asked, and the diagnosis can be confirmed by a small number of tests to exclude structural disease. Improved understanding of the differences in gut function in patients with IBS is likely to result in the development of some exciting new therapies.},

   abstract = {In the development of a management strategy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients we must consider the great number of people with the condition, most of whom do not consult doctors for it. Furthermore, we must be aware of the hidden agenda of those that do. The cause of IBS is unknown, and consequently cure of this chronic recurrent condition is not likely. Moreover, the disorder is very costly, drawing precious resources from the care of more serious diseases. In this chapter I propose a management strategy based on a firm diagnosis of IBS using a minimum of tests, consideration of the patient's agenda, the use of dietary advice, the strategic use of drugs only in resistant cases, a graded therapeutic response and continuing care. There is no specific treatment. The doctor-patient interaction is most important to allay patients' fears and concerns, assist them with psychosocial difficulties, and provide the caring support known to maximize the 'placebo' effect of any treatment.},

   abstract = {The first step in managing a patient with constipation is to understand the precise nature of the complaint. Is the onset recent? What are the frequency and form of the stools, and how much effort is required to defecate? Is constipation steady or alternating as in irritable bowel syndrome? Are there structural, metabolic or pharmacological confounders? Is the patient depressed? Has dietary fibre been tried at a sufficient dose? What are the patient's understanding and beliefs about the symptoms? Has there been sufficient and appropriate investigation? Armed with the answers to these questions, physicians can help most patients through lifestyle, dietary and pharmacological adjustments, along with supplementary fibre. Some patients may require regular doses of an osmotic laxative. Those few that fail these measures should have their transit time estimated while on a high fibre diet; if it is normal, further testing is unlikely to help. The above efforts should be re-emphasized, and reassurance should be offered. Some patients may require a psychological assessment. If transit time is prolonged and the patient may benefit from surgery for colonic inertia or biofeedback for anismus, then colon and anorectal function should be assessed. The decision to perform further tests should be made carefully, and unrealistic expectations should be discouraged. Before surgery is offered, the patient should have the benefit of receiving an expert opinion. Biofeedback helps some patients with isolated anorectal dysfunction.},

   abstract = {The Rome diagnostic criteria for the functional bowel disorders and functional abdominal pain are used widely in research and practice. A committee consensus approach, including criticism from multinational expert reviewers, was used to revise the diagnostic criteria and update diagnosis and treatment recommendations, based on research results. The terminology was clarified and the diagnostic criteria and management recommendations were revised. A functional bowel disorder (FBD) is diagnosed by characteristic symptoms for at least 12 weeks during the preceding 12 months in the absence of a structural or biochemical explanation. The irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal bloating, functional constipation, and functional diarrhea are distinguished by symptom-based diagnostic criteria. Unspecified FBD lacks criteria for the other FBDs. Diagnostic testing is individualized, depending on patient age, primary symptom characteristics, and other clinical and laboratory features. Functional abdominal pain (FAP) is defined as either the FAP syndrome, which requires at least six months of pain with poor relation to gut function and loss of daily activities, or unspecified FAP, which lacks criteria for the FAP syndrome. An organic cause for the pain must be excluded, but aspects of the patient's pain behavior are of primary importance. Treatment of the FBDs relies upon confident diagnosis, explanation, and reassurance. Diet alteration, drug treatment, and psychotherapy may be beneficial, depending on the symptoms and psychological features.},

   abstract = {I believe there are four essential elements in the management of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): to establish a good physician-patient relationship; to educate patients about their condition; to emphasize the excellent prognosis and benign nature of the illness; and to employ therapeutic interventions centering on dietary modifications, pharmacotherapy, and behavioral strategies tailored to the individual. Initially, I establish the diagnosis, exclude organic causes, educate patients about the disease, establish realistic expectations and consistent limits, and involve patients in disease management. I find it critical to determine why the patient is seeking assistance (eg, cancer phobia, disability, interpersonal distress, or exacerbation of symptoms). Most patients can be treated by their primary care physician. However, specialty consultations may be needed to reinforce management strategies, perform additional diagnostic tests, or institute specialized treatment. Psychological co-morbidities do not cause symptoms but do affect how patients respond to them and influence health care-seeking behavior. I find that these issues are best explored over a series of visits when the physician-patient relationship has been established. It can be helpful to have patients fill out a self-administered test to identify psychological co-morbidities. I often use these tests as a basis for extended inquiries into this area, resulting in the initiation of appropriate therapies. I encourage patients to keep a 2-week diary of food intake and gastrointestinal symptoms. In this way, patients become actively involved in management of their disease, and I may be able to obtain information from the diary that will be valuable in making treatment decisions. I do not believe that diagnostic studies for food intolerances are cost-effective or particularly helpful; however, exclusion diets may be beneficial. I introduce fiber supplements gradually and monitor them for tolerance and palatability. Synthetic fiber is often better-tolerated than natural fiber, but must be individualized. In my experience, excessive fiber supplementation often is counterproductive, as abdominal cramps and bloating may worsen. Antidiarrheal agents are very effective when used correctly, preferably in divided doses. I use them in patients in anticipation of diarrhea and especially in those who fear symptoms when engaged in activities outside the home. I encourage patients to make decisions as to when and how much to use. However, almost always, a morning dose before breakfast is used (loperamide, 2 to 6 mg) and, perhaps again later in the day when symptoms of diarrhea are prominent. I prefer antispasmodics to be used intermittently in response to periods of increased abdominal pain, cramps, and urgency. For patients with daily symptoms, especially after meals, agents such as dicyclomine before meals are useful. For patients with infrequent but severe episodes of unpredictable pain, sublingual hyoscyamine often produces rapid relief and instills confidence. In general, I recommend that oral antispasmodics be used for a limited period of time rather than indefinitely, and generally for periods of time when symptoms are prominent. For chronic visceral pain syndromes, I recommend small doses of tricyclic antidepressants. These agents are especially effective in diarrhea-predominant patients with disturbed sleep patterns but may be unacceptable to patients with constipation. I educate patients that side effects occur early and benefits may not be apparent for 3 to 4 weeks. I consider using SSRIs in low doses in patients with constipation-predominant IBS; cisapride, 10 to 20 mg three times per day, also may be beneficial. When taken with drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450, cisapride has been associated with serious cardiac arrhythmias caused by QT prolongation, including ventricular arrhythmias and torsades de pointes. These drugs include the azole fungicides; erythromycin, clarithromycin, and troleandomycin; some antidepressants; HIV protease inhibitors; and others. In patients with IBS with mild to moderate co-morbid depression, I have found that the use of SSRIs such as paroxetine, fluoxetine, or sertraline may be beneficial. It is important to tell patients that anxiety and disturbed sleep may occur during the first 10 days and benefits may not occur for 3 to 4 weeks. I prescribe a small amount of a short-acting benzodiazepine such as alprazolam, 0.5 mg two times per day, to control these symptoms. For generalized anxiety without depression, buspirone or clonazepam may be useful. I have found that patients who also have associated panic disorder may benefit from a benzodiazepine, tricyclic antidepressant, or an SSRI. However, these patients are best managed in conjunction with a psychiatrist or psychologist. I consider the use of alternative therapies in patients who fail to respond to conventional measures and who are receptive to alternative strategies. These include general relaxation techniques such as biofeedback and hypnosis therapies.},

   abstract = {Dietary lifestyle is relevant for prevention and treatment of various colorectal conditions. Colorectal disorders have significant morbidity and mortality in a western-style community, particularly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), colorectal cancer, haemorrhoids, constipation and diverticular disease. This review addresses how bowel health can be maintained, what foods and dietary lifestyles are associated with risk for disease and what foods are of real value in management. Bowel health is that state where the individual is satisfied with defaecation, the diet does not create undue risk for disease and lumenal contents maintain an intact and functional mucosa. Bowel health depends on a healthy dietary lifestyle, but in particular on an adequate intake of non-digestable dietary polysaccharide. Diet influences biology in part by altering the lumenal environment. Effects such as high butyrate levels, lowered pH, a predominance of 'healthy'over 'unhealthy' bacteria, rapid intestinal transit, high faecal bulk, a non-leaky epithelial barrier, adsorption of dietary carcinogens by fibre, low bile salt concentrations, reduced generation of toxic bile salts or protein derivatives and provision of certain bioactive substances are seen as beneficial. Diet influences future risk for colorectal cancer (vegetables, animal fats, polysaccharides amongst others) and for diverticular disease (fibre). Adequate fibre and resistant starch can improve constipation and anorectal conditions such as fissure and haemorrhoids. The role of diet in managing patients with IBS is complex. Fibre may worsen symptoms in severe cases of IBS, diverticular disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Certain carbohydrates of limited digestibility/absorbability, such as lactose, fructose and sorbitol, can precipitate IBS symptoms. Low fat, high fibre diets may reduce recurrence of colorectal adenomas. Diet has a significant role to play in colorectal disorders.},
