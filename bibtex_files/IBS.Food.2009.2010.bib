   abstract = {(1) Patients frequently complain of occasional bowel movement disorders, associated with abdominal pain or discomfort, but they are rarely due to an underlying organ involvement. Even when patients have recurrent symptoms, serious disorders are no more frequent in these patients than in the general population, unless other manifestations, anaemia, or an inflammatory syndrome is also present; (2) There is currently no way of radically modifying the natural course of recurrent irritable bowel syndrome; (3) The effects of antispasmodics on abdominal pain have been tested in about 20 randomised controlled trials. Pinaverium and peppermint essential oil have the best-documented efficacy and only moderate adverse effects. Antispasmodics with marked atropinic effects do not have a favourable risk-benefit balance; (4) Tricylic antidepressants seem to have only modest analgesic effects in this setting. In contrast, their adverse effects are frequent and they have somewhat negative risk-benefit balances. Nor has the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs) been demonstrated; (5) Alosetron and tegaserod carry a risk of potentially life-threatening adverse effects and therefore have negative risk-benefit balances; (6) Seeds of plants such as psyllium and ispaghul, as well as raw apples and pears, have a limited impact on constipation and pain. Osmotic laxatives are effective on constipation. Symptomatic treatments for constipation can sometimes aggravate abdominal discomfort; (7) Loperamide has been poorly assessed in patients with recurrent irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea. It modestly slows bowel movement but does not relieve pain or abdominal discomfort; (8) Dietary measures have not been tested in comparative trials. Some patients are convinced that certain foods provoke a recurrence of irritable bowel syndrome, but restrictive diets carry a risk of nutritional deficiencies; (9) Various techniques intended to control emotional and psychological disturbances have been proposed, including relaxation, biofeedback, hypnosis, and psychotherapy. The results of clinical trials are not convincing; (10) Oral products containing live bacteria, designed to change the equilibrium of intestinal flora, have been tested in 13 placebo-controlled trials, with inconsistent results. A few cases of septicaemia have been reported; (11) The six available trials of acupuncture (versus sham acupuncture) showed no more than a placebo effect; (12) In practice, patients who have recurrent irritable bowel syndrome but with no other signs of a condition warranting specific treatment should be reassured as to the harmless nature of their disorder if a careful physical examination and basic laboratory tests are negative. The only available treatments have purely symptomatic effects and only limited efficacy. It is best to avoid using all treatments and additional diagnostic investigations that carry a risk of disproportionate adverse effects.},

   abstract = {Gastrointestinal disturbances (particularly diarrhea) are often induced in response to cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. Oral chemotherapeutic agents can induce diarrhea by damaging the intestinal lining. Two common oral drugs used in cancer treatment that are known to have gastrointestinal side effects are capecitabine and lapatinib. In this brief communication, the authors discuss a case study of a stage IV breast cancer patient whose chemotherapy-induced diarrhea was treated successfully with a multispecies combination of probiotics. This is a unique study in which grade 3 chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (characterized by 7-9 stools per day and associated with incontinence and abdominal cramping) was treated with only a multispecies combination of probiotics. Probiotics have been used to treat diarrhea in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, and Crohn's disease. More recently, probiotics have been used to treat chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in colon cancer patients. This case study demonstrates that the probiotics can also be used to treat severe cases of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in breast cancer patients. The use of different probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases is an increasingly important area of study, and more research into this area is needed. This study demonstrates that probiotics should be considered for advanced breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A sensation of abdominal swelling (bloating) and actual increase in girth (distension) are troublesome features of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is more common in patients with constipation, especially those with delayed transit. AIM: To establish whether a fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 reduces distension in association with acceleration of gastrointestinal transit and improvement of symptoms in IBS with constipation. METHODS: A single centre, randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel group study in which patients consumed the test product or control product for 4 weeks. Distension, orocaecal and colonic transit and IBS symptoms were assessed on an intention-to-treat population of 34 patients. RESULTS: Compared with control product, the test product resulted in a significant reduction in the percentage change in maximal distension [median difference - 39%, 95% CI (-78, -5); P = 0.02] and a trend towards reduced mean distension during the day [-1.52 cm (-3.33, 0.39); P = 0.096]. An acceleration of orocaecal [-1.2 h (-2.3,0); P = 0.049] as well as colonic [-12.2 h (-22.8, -1.6); P = 0.026] transit was observed and overall symptom severity [-0.5 (-1.0, -0.05); P = 0.032] also improved. CONCLUSIONS: This probiotic resulted in improvements in objectively measured abdominal girth and gastrointestinal transit, as well as reduced symptomatology. These data support the concept that accelerating transit is a useful strategy for treating distension.},

   abstract = {Abstract Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), frequently associated with psychological distress, is characterized by hypersensitivity to gut wall distension. Some probiotics are able to alleviate IBS symptoms and reduce visceromotor response to mechanical stimuli in animals. Moreover, we have previously shown that Lactobacillus farciminis treatment abolished the hyperalgesia to colorectal distension (CRD) induced by acute stress. The aims of the present study were to determine whether (i) stress-induced visceral hyperalgesia modifies the expression of Fos, a marker of general neuronal activation, induced by CRD, (ii) this activation can be modulated by L. farciminis treatment. Female rats were treated by L. farciminis and CRD was performed after partial restraint stress (PRS) or sham-PRS. The expression of Fos protein was measured by immunohistochemistry. After CRD or PRS, Fos expression was increased in spinal cord section (S1), nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, and in the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA). The combination of both stimuli, PRS and CRD, markedly increased this Fos overexpression in the sacral spinal cord section, PVN and MeA, but not in NTS. By contrast, a pretreatment with L. farciminis significantly reduced the number of Fos positive cells in these area. This study shows that PRS enhances Fos protein expression induced by CRD at the spinal and supraspinal levels in rats. Lactobacillus farciminis treatment inhibited this enhancing effect, suggesting that the antinociceptive effect of this probiotic strain results from a decrease of the stress-induced activation/sensitization of sensory neurons at the spinal and supraspinal level.},

In March 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suspended its use citing increased cardiovascular (CV) events in clinical trials. However, there is no known mechanistic basis for an adverse CV effect. To reassess the CV safety of tegaserod, teagaserod-treated patients (pts) in the Intermountain Healthcare database were identified (n = 2603), matched 1:6 with untreated (n = 15,618) patients by age, sex, and date of tegaserod initiation, and followed for an average of 2.5 years. Age averaged 38.6 +/- 13.5 years, and 94% were female. Cardiovascular event rates were low and similar in patients treated with tegaserod and matched untreated patients. For the primary composite CV endpoint, 54 (0.35%) untreated and 12 (0.46%) treated pts had an event (treated OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.68-2.38, P =.46), with 7 and 0 events, respectively, occurring within 3 months. A total of 12 (0.1%) untreated and 1 (<0.1%) treated pts were hospitalized for a myocardial infarction (MI). 36 (0.2%) untreated and 10 (0.4%) treated pts for a cardiovascular accident, and 1 pt in each group for unstable angina. A total of 6 (<0.1%) untreated and no treated pts died from cardiac causes. Event rates were comparable to expected rates in this population of mostly premenopausal women. This large epidemiologic study failed to confirm a reported large event differential for tegaserod that was noted incidentally in a clinical trials database, suggesting that the prior observation may have been due to chance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dinitrofluorobenzene/dinitrosulfonic acid (DNFB/DNS) model was originally described as an experimental model of intestinal inflammation resembling human ulcerative colitis (UC). Due to the absence of acceptable UC experimental models for pharmacological preclinical assays, here we examine the immune response induced in this model. METHODS: Balb/c mice were sensitized by skin application of DNFB on day 1, followed by an intrarectal challenge with DNS on day 5. We further expanded this model by administering a second DNS challenge on day 15. The features of colonic inflammation and immune response were evaluated. RESULTS: The changes observed in colonic tissue corresponded, in comparison to the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis model, to a mild mucosal effect in the colon, which spontaneously resolved in less than 5 days. Furthermore, the second hapten challenge did not exacerbate the inflammatory response. In contrast to other studies, we did not observe any clear involvement of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or other Th1 cytokines during the initial inflammatory response; however, we found that a more Th2-humoral response appeared to mediate the first contact with the hapten. An increased humoral response was detected during the second challenge, although an increased Th1/Th17-cytokine expression profile was also simultaneously observed. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these results, although the DNFB/DNS model can display some features found in human UC, it should be considered as a model for the study of the intestinal hypersensitivity seen, for example, during food allergy or irritable bowel syndrome but not intestinal inflammation per se.},

   abstract = {Neonatal stress is a common early life event which alters the development of the endocrine and immune systems. Specifically, exposure to neonatal stress results in alterations to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis resulting in offspring who hyper-respond to stress in adulthood. Recently, this concept has been applied to the ontogeny of functional gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The high prevalence of this disorder and the ineffectiveness of current treatments results in high direct and indirect costs to the society. Recently, administration of probiotics to neonates has been used as a safe and cost-effective preventative strategy to revoke the long term unfavourable imprinting induced on the gastrointestinal system by early life stressors in animal models of human IBS. It is not as yet known however, whether maternal supplementary probiotics may also contribute to improved GI integrity and gut-associated immune functioning in stressed neonates, if these possible improvements persist into adulthood, or how this protective effect may be mediated. Our hypothesis is an attempt to link this proposed nutritional approach and its possible preventive effects against GI dysfunctions provoked by neonatal stress.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of increasing the dietary content of soluble fibre (psyllium) or insoluble fibre (bran) in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: General practice. PARTICIPANTS: 275 patients aged 18-65 years with irritable bowel syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: 12 weeks of treatment with 10 g psyllium (n=85), 10 g bran (n=97), or 10 g placebo (rice flour) (n=93). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was adequate symptom relief during at least two weeks in the previous month, analysed after one, two, and three months of treatment to assess both short term and sustained effectiveness. Secondary end points included irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity score, severity of abdominal pain, and irritable bowel syndrome quality of life scale. RESULTS: The proportion of responders was significantly greater in the psyllium group than in the placebo group during the first month (57% v 35%; relative risk 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 2.26) and the second month of treatment (59% v 41%; 1.44, 1.02 to 2.06). Bran was more effective than placebo during the third month of treatment only (57% v 32%; 1.70, 1.12 to 2.57), but this was not statistically significant in the worst case analysis (1.45, 0.97 to 2.16). After three months of treatment, symptom severity in the psyllium group was reduced by 90 points, compared with 49 points in the placebo group (P=0.03) and 58 points in the bran group (P=0.61 versus placebo). No differences were found with respect to quality of life. Fifty four (64%) of the patients allocated to psyllium, 54 (56%) in the bran group, and 56 (60%) in the placebo group completed the three month treatment period. Early dropout was most common in the bran group; the main reason was that the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome worsened. CONCLUSIONS: Psyllium offers benefits in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in primary care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trials NCT00189033.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE) and eosinophilic colitis (ECO) are two forms of chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by eosinophil accumulation in the mucosa or in deeper layers of the gastrointestinal wall and associated with atopic disease. The eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases broadened the spectrum of atopic gastrointestinal disorders formerly restricted to food allergy manifestating at the gastrointestinal mucosa. Their awareness increased enormously; therefore, we will review current knowledge about atopic gastrointestinal diseases for the allergologist. RECENT FINDINGS: Major attention will be drawn to the differential diagnosis, because symptoms of atopic gastrointestinal diseases frequently mimic those of other chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), although the diseases are distinct in their histopathology, gene expression signature, response to therapy, and association with allergies. The pathogenesis of EGE and ECO will be described that involves environmental and genetic factors, particularly food antigens and expression level of interleukin (IL)-5 and selective chemokines. SUMMARY: Understanding symptoms and pathology of such disease is the basis of a rational treatment based on reduced exposure to offending food antigens as well as anti-inflammatory therapy. Atopic gastrointestinal diseases are in many cases reversible; however, chronic treatment is often necessary to prevent relapse.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional digestive disorder, and may affect 11-20% of the adult population in industrialized countries. In accordance with Rome III criteria (2006) IBS involves abdominal pain and bowel habit disturbance, which are not explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities. Several hypotheses attempt to account for the pathophysiology of IBS, but the etiology still remains uncertain or obscure, perhaps multifactorial. Abnormalities in colonic microflora have recently been suggested in such patients, as has abnormal small-intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), or in particular a significant reduction in the amount of intraluminal Bifidobacteria or Lactobacilli, with consequences like the production of colonic gas, and motility or sensitivity disturbances of the intestinal tract. The disorder is difficult to treat, and the wide spectrum of non-drug and drug treatments shows our ignorance about the cause of the condition. Newer drugs, both pro- and anti-serotonin, have failed to show long-term efficacy or have been withdrawn due to concerns about harmful effects. Recent research has provided increasing support for the idea that disturbances of intestinal microbiota occur in patients with IBS, and that such abnormalities may contribute to IBS symptoms. Studies in Scandinavian countries in the last ten years emphasize the role of probiotics in the modulation of intestinal microbiota, and as a consequence in the regulation of the motility and hypersensitivity of the digestive tract. Although results between studies are difficult to compare because of differences in study design, probiotic dose, strain, and duration of therapy, some studies show symptom improvement. Lactobacilli are found among the normal bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract, and Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp) is one of the species frequently isolated from the human mucosa, which is capable of surviving the low pH of the stomach and duodenum, resisting the effect of bile acids in the upper small intestine when ingested, and temporarily colonizing the gastrointestinal tract by binding to the intestinal and colonic mucosa. Concurrent with colonization by Lp there is a decrease in bacterial groups with gas-producing ability, such as Veillonella spp. and Clostridia spp. Evidence has now accumulated to suggest the efficacy of certain probiotics like Lp299v, which may be capable of bringing about a significant reduction in pain, abdominal distension and flatulence, while increasing health-related quality of life in IBS.},

OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the dietary triggers for IBS and the role of diagnostic testing in patients with IBS. DISCUSSION: In addition to the long standing implication of lactose in lactase deficient patients, fermentable dietary oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, together with very low carbohydrate diets, have been increasingly recognised as important in the causation and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Understanding their role and utilising the services of a practising dietician have become additional important tools for general practitioners managing this common complaint.},

The few medications that are effective for treating global IBS symptoms have either been withdrawn or restricted due to detrimental side effects; thus, safe and effective alternatives are urgently needed. Increasing data have revealed that inflammatory changes may play a role in the development of IBS, and probiotics, commensal organisms with inherent health benefits, may alter that milieu. Although their exact mechanisms of action remain elusive, it is clear that the beneficial properties inherent to each probiotic species are strain specific. Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 ( B infantis 35624; Bifantis, The Procter & Gamble Company, Cincinnati, OH), is a probiotic with unique abilities to reduce intestinal inflammation. Two randomized, controlled trials have validated its efficacy for treating both individual and global IBS symptoms without evidence to suggest an increase in adverse events. B. infantis 35624 appears safe and effective for the treatment of IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder and available therapies have limited efficacy. Mucosal inflammation and alterations in gut microflora may contribute to the development of IBS symptoms, and researchers have hypothesized that probiotics might improve these symptoms. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of probiotics in the treatment of IBS. METHODS: Comprehensive literature searches of multiple databases were performed. Study selection criteria were as follows: (i) RCTs, (ii) adults with IBS defined by Manning or Rome II criteria, (iii) single or combination probiotic vs. placebo, and (iv) improvement in IBS symptoms and/or decrease in frequency of adverse events reported. Data about study design and results were extracted in duplicate using standardized data extraction forms. Owing to variability in outcome measures, quantitative pooling of data was not feasible. RESULTS: A total of 16 RCTs met selection criteria. Of those, 11 studies showed suboptimal study design with inadequate blinding, inadequate trial length, inadequate sample size, and/or lack of intention-to-treat analysis. None of the studies provided quantifiable data about both tolerability and adverse events. Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 showed significant improvement in the composite score for abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/distention, and/or bowel movement difficulty compared with placebo (P<0.05) in two appropriately designed studies. No other probiotic showed significant improvement in IBS symptoms in an appropriately designed study. CONCLUSIONS: B. infantis 35624 has shown efficacy for improvement of IBS symptoms. Most RCTs about the utility of probiotics in IBS have not used an appropriate study design and do not adequately report adverse events. Therefore, there is inadequate data to comment on the efficacy of other probiotics. Future probiotic studies should follow Rome II recommendations for appropriate design of an RCT.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the evidences for the usefulness of dietary manipulations (including the use of probiotics and prebiotics) in the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). RECENT FINDINGS: Exclusion diets do not have a role in the management of these patients except in the case of malabsorbed sugars (lactose, fructose). However, recent work suggests that excluding these sugars is more effective in non-IBS than in IBS patients. Also, the first small open series on the use of very low (20 g/day) carbohydrate diet (VLCD) in IBS has been published with promising results. However, safety concerns do not allow us to recommend them. In the period of review, further evidence has been provided on the role of psyllium in IBS. Also, the available evidence on the use of probiotics in IBS has been meta-analyzed. SUMMARY: IBS patients should eat a balanced diet without restrictions, and (except for malabsorbed sugars) exclusion diets are not useful in most of them. The role of VLCD remains to be established. The concept that increasing fiber intake is useful for IBS may not be true for all patients, and hydrophilic colloids (e.g. psyllium) are preferred. There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of probiotics in IBS.},

   abstract = {Lactose and food intolerance cause a wide range of gut and systemic symptoms, including gas, gut pain, diarrhoea or constipation, severe headaches, severe fatigue, loss of cognitive functions such as concentration, memory and reasoning, muscle and joint pain, heart palpitations, and a variety of allergies (Matthews and Campbell, 2000; Matthews et al., 2005; Waud et al., 2008). These can be explained by the production of toxic metabolites from gut bacteria, as a result of anaerobic digestion of carbohydrates and other foods, not absorbed in the small intestine. These metabolites include alcohols, diols such as butan 2,3 diol, ketones, acids, and aldehydes such as methylglyoxal (Campbell et al., 2005, 2009). These 'toxins' induce calcium signals in bacteria and affect their growth, thereby acting to modify the balance of microflora in the gut (Campbell et al., 2004, 2007a,b). These bacterial 'toxins' also affect signalling mechanisms in cells around the body, thereby explaining the wide range of symptoms in people with food intolerance. This new mechanism also explains the most common referral to gastroenterologists, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and the illness that afflicted Charles Darwin for 50 years (Campbell and Matthews, 2005a,b). We propose it will lead to a new understanding of the molecular mechanism of type 2 diabetes and some cancers.},

   abstract = {The general practitioner is most likely to benefit from this "Opinion Paper" about the functional intestinal disorders, both as an update and as a tool to improve his/her relationship with patients. Four functional intestinal disorders have been described: irritable bowel syndrome, functional bloating, functional constipation and functional diarrhea. All such disorders are defined by non-specific symptoms, referred to the middle and/or lower gastrointestinal tract without evidence of any organic basis. Symptoms should have arisen at least six months earlier, and they should have recurred at least three times monthly over the last three months. Disorders of motility, visceral hypersensitivity, inflammatory and immune disorders, as well as psycho-social, genetic and environmental factors, have all been involved in the pathophysiology of functional intestinal disorders; disturbances of the colonic bacterial flora are also suggested to have a leading role and interventions to correct them are most useful. Functional intestinal disorders as described in the validated Rome III Criteria are possibly too much categorized, but such criteria still are the only useful tool for diagnosis and therapeutic choices. Clinical history is crucial for diagnosis, meaning when symptoms were first detected and how they evolve, alternate, and associate. A diagnostic diary to report symptoms, daily activities, and foods may also be helpful. Functional intestinal disorders persist over time, and they heavily interfere with quality of life; they also have a heavy impact on economical resources. However, intestinal functional disorders are not associated with dangerous sequelae or mortality. It is up to general practitioners to reassure patients and to prescribe first-level diagnostic exams appropriately.},

This review examines recent studies on the clinical use of monostrain and multistrain probiotic products in gastroenterology. The most widely studied strains are lactobacilli and yeasts, specifically, Lacto-bacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomices boulardii; the gastrointestinal disorders most commonly treated with probiotics are inflammatory bowel disease and dysbiosis, both of which clinically manifest as diarrhea.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: A percentage of patients with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) suffer from food hypersensitivity (FH) and improve on a food-elimination diet. No assays have satisfactory levels of sensitivity for identifying patients with FH. We evaluated the efficacy of an in vitro basophil activation assay in the diagnosis of FH in IBS-like patients. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 120 consecutive patients diagnosed with IBS according to Rome II criteria. We analyzed in vitro activation of basophils by food allergens (based on levels of CD63 expression), as well as total and food-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels in serum. Effects of elimination diets and double-blind food challenges were used as standards for FH diagnosis. RESULTS: Twenty-four of the patients (20%) had FH (cow's milk and/or wheat hypersensitivity); their symptom scores improved significantly when they were placed on an elimination diet. Patients with FH differed from other IBS patients in that they had a longer duration of clinical history, a history of FH as children, and an increased frequency of self-reported FH; they also had hypersensitivities to other antigens (eg, egg or soy). The basophil activation assay diagnosed FH with 86% sensitivity, 88% specificity, and 87% accuracy; this level of sensitivity was significantly higher than that of serum total IgE or food-specific IgE assays. CONCLUSIONS: A cytometric assay that quantifies basophils after stimulation with food antigens based on cell-surface expression of CD63 had high levels of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in diagnosing FH. This assay might be used to diagnose FH in patients with IBS-like symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition associated with no certain organic cause, though diet and stress are widely implicated. The condition is frustrating for both sufferers and doctors, and there are problems in diagnosing and treating the condition. Eliciting explanatory models (EMs) is a useful tool for understanding how individuals relate to their illnesses and their expectations for treatment, particularly for illnesses with uncertain aetiology like IBS. OBJECTIVES: To understand the EMs, experiences and expectations for management of patients with IBS. METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 51 primary care patients (31 in the UK, 20 in The Netherlands) meeting the Rome II diagnostic criteria for IBS. RESULTS: Although IBS often had a significant dampening effect on daily life, IBS patients made great efforts not to allow the condition to take over their lives. Triggers of symptoms were more important to patients than understanding the underlying aetiology of IBS. Diet and stress were both recognized as important triggers, but views about which foods were problematic and the extent to which stress was modifiable were inconsistent. Diagnosis and treatment were often a confusing and frustrating process, and patients often expected more diagnostic tests than they were offered before receiving a diagnosis of IBS. However, the often poor outcome of medical interventions does not, in general, appear to have a negative impact on the patient-doctor relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the extensive impact of IBS on sufferers' daily life and the frustration that results from repeatedly trying treatments with little effect. Clearly explaining the guidelines for diagnosing IBS and the range of treatment options may help patients to make sense of the diagnostic and treatment processes. The personal EM should be addressed during the consultation with the IBS patient, ensuring that any successive medical interventions match with the patients' disease perception.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a four week kiwifruit intervention on bowel function in patients diagnosed with IBS/C. Fifty-four patients with IBS/C and 16 healthy adults participated in this study. All subjects participated in the 6 week, three phase study, which included a baseline phase (1 week), a dietary intervention period (4 weeks), and a post-intervention phase (1 week). Forty-one IBS/C patients and all healthy adults consumed two Hayward green (Actinida deliciosa var) kiwifruits per day for 4 weeks. Thirteen IBS/C patients in the control group took two placebo capsules per day for 4 weeks. Colon transit time was measured immediately prior to and following the intervention period. All subjects completed daily defecation records. After the 4-week intervention, weekly defecation frequency significantly increased in the IBS/C group of participants who consumed kiwifruit (p<0.05). Colon transit time significantly decreased (p=0.026) in the IBS/C group that consumed kiwi fruit. These findings suggest that kiwifruit consumption for 4 weeks shortens colon transit time, increases defecation frequency, and improves bowel function in adults diagnosed with IBS/C.},

   abstract = {In contrast to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the prevalence and risk factors for diarrhoea in the absence of IBS in the community are unknown. We aimed to evaluate potential risk factors for chronic diarrhoea (non-IBS). A valid questionnaire that recorded gastrointestinal symptoms required for a diagnosis of chronic diarrhoea, self-reported measures of potential risk factors, and a somatic symptom checklist was mailed to an age- and gender-stratified random sample of Olmsted County, Minnesota residents (30-64 year). Chronic diarrhoea was defined as reporting one or more of the following symptoms more than 25% of the time in the past 3 months: > or =3 bowel movements a day, loose or watery stools, or faecal urgency. Subjects with IBS (Rome III) were excluded. Of 892 eligible subjects, 653 (73%) responded. Among 523 respondents not reporting IBS, chronic diarrhoea was reported by 148 (28%); 90 (61%) had chronic painless diarrhoea. Chronic diarrhoea was significantly associated with self-reported food sensitivity (OR = 2.05 [1.31-3.20]) and stress (OR = 1.99 [1.03-3.85]). Both remained significant in the adjusted variable models that excluded subjects with any abdominal pain. Female gender (OR = 0.67 [0.45-0.98]) and higher education level (OR = 0.60 [0.39-0.92]) had smaller odds for chronic diarrhoea. No association was detected for age, marital status, body mass index, cigarette or alcohol use, coffee, analgesics, emotional support, pets or water source. Chronic diarrhoea in the absence of IBS is common; self-reported food sensitivity, male gender and a lower level of education are risk factors.},

It accounts for a significant healthcare burden, and symptoms may be debilitating for some patients. Traditional symptom-based therapies have been found to be ineffective in the treatment of the entire syndrome complex, and do not modify the natural history of the disorder. Although the exact etiopathogenesis of IBS is incompletely understood, recent advances in the elucidation of the pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms of IBS have resulted in the development of novel therapies, as well as potential future therapeutic targets.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Alosetron is a potent, selective 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist prescribed for women with severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) under a risk management plan (RMP). The RMP was implemented following cases of ischemic colitis (IC) and complications of constipation (CoC) associated with the use of alosetron. The objectives of this study were to characterize IC and CoC clinical features, outcomes, and incidence rates in the new restricted patient population to evaluate the effectiveness of the RMP in the prevention of serious outcomes. METHODS: Safety data from adverse event reporting from November 2002 through June 2008 were reviewed for probable and possible IC and CoC using the US Food and Drug Administration/sponsor-defined criteria and definitions. Evidence for IC included medical documentation, colonoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy+/-biopsy. Evidence for CoC included medical history and confirmation from health-care professionals. RESULTS: Within the inclusion dates, 29,072 patients received 203,939 alosetron prescriptions. Although the absolute numbers of IC and CoC cases have declined, the incidence rates for IC and CoC (0.95 and 0.36 cases per 1,000 patient-years, respectively) were similar to rates during the postmarketing cycle before alosetron withdrawal. In patients with severe IBS-D receiving alosetron (n=998) or placebo (n=411) in clinical trials since reintroduction, incidence rates for IC were 4 and 2 cases per 1,000 patients, respectively. Rates for CoC were 2 and 0 cases per 1,000 patients in the alosetron and placebo groups, respectively. No mesenteric ischemia, surgeries, transfusions, or deaths occurred in patients with IC and no cases of CoC were associated with toxic megacolon, perforation, surgeries, transfusions, or deaths. IC and CoC cases were typically of short duration and all improved on prompt withdrawal of alosetron. CONCLUSIONS: Serious outcomes associated with IC and CoC appear to be mitigated since introduction of alosetron under the RMP.},

   abstract = {Irregularities of serotonin function in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be due to changes in the metabolism of the serotonin precursor l-tryptophan. Dietary alteration of tryptophan intake may impact upon the mood and bowel symptoms of IBS. We hypothesized that diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (d-IBS) patients would exhibit an increase in plasma tryptophan due to alterations in tryptophan metabolism. We also hypothesized that a diet low in tryptophan would reverse this change and reduce symptoms. Thirteen patients with d-IBS had fasting serum free and total tryptophan, large neutral amino acids, and 6 kynurenine metabolites measured before and after 2 weeks of a strict dairy-free diet. Baseline tryptophan parameters were compared with an age- and sex-matched control group. Changes in the specific tryptophan parameters before and after dairy-free diet were correlated with symptoms of IBS and mood. Compared with the control group, d-IBS patients at baseline exhibited significantly higher free serum tryptophan (10.5 +/- 4.35 vs 4.75 +/- 2.43 mumol/L [means +/- standard deviation], P = .006) and significantly lower tryptophan dioxygenase and total tryptophan oxidation as measured by the kynurenine to free tryptophan and total kynurenines to free tryptophan ratios (23.37 +/- 10.12 vs 55.33 +/- 16.02, P < .001 and 49.34 +/- 17.84 vs 258.46 +/- 98.67, P < .001, respectively). Dairy-free diet did not modulate metabolites of the kynurenine pathway or symptoms. Tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway is inhibited in d-IBS, and a dairy-free diet does not alter this. Our findings are consistent with possible enhanced serotonin activity in d-IBS.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota plays an important role in host health due to its involvement in nutritional, immunologic and physiological functions. Microbial imbalances have been associated with enhanced risk of specific diseases. This observation has allowed the introduction of microorganisms as probiotics which are microbes with demonstrated health benefits in humans when ingested in foods. The mechanisms of action include the inhibition of pathogen growth by competition for nutritional sources and adhesion sites, secretion of antimicrobial substances, toxin inactivation. Consequently, the primary clinical interest in the application of probiotics has been in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal infections and antibiotic-associated diarrhea diseases. The well-characterized immunomodulatory potential of specific probiotic strains, beyond the effect on the composition of the microbiota, has been be used as innovative tools to alleviate intestinal inflammation, normalize gut mucosal dysfunction, and down-regulate hypersensitivity reactions. Clinical efficacy of specific probiotic strains has been demonstrated in, rotavirus's diarrhea, antibiotic associated diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome and food allergies. Further, recent clinical and nutritional studies have uncovered the function of specific strains in energy metabolism and thereby have opened up new angles on their exploitation. However, as these processes are highly specific, it is important to characterize the properties of specific probiotic strains an in order to select the best strains or strain combinations for the target in question. Advances have prompted increased the interest of researchers and industry and new applications and targets are being discovered.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of identifying lactose maldigestion (LM) and fructose malabsorption (FM) on patients with and without IBS. METHODS: Patients who received lactose and fructose challenge testing formed the study group. Carbohydrate challenge testing was performed with 50 g lactose and 25 g fructose. Breath samples were collected and analyzed for hydrogen, methane, and CO2 (for correction) using a MicroLyzer Model SC (QuinTron Instrument Company, Milwaukee, WI). Questionnaires were used to assess Rome III IBS criteria, compliance with carbohydrate dietary modifications, and changes in symptoms. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-one of the 181 (67%) study subjects were able to be contacted 8 months to 4 years after carbohydrate testing. LM (21) and FM (2) were seen in 33% of the 66 IBS subjects. LM (12) and FM (9) were seen in 33% of the 55 subjects without IBS. Seventy-seven percent of IBS and 72% of those without IBS reported compliance with dietary advice. Of the subjects who reported compliance, 47% of IBS and 77% of those without IBS reported that, after identifying LM or FM, their symptoms resolved or improved. CONCLUSIONS: Carbohydrate maldigestion has a similar incidence in patients with and without IBS and both populations have similar compliance with therapeutic diets. However, patients without IBS are more likely to have improvement in symptoms when dietary changes are instituted when compared to IBS patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of crofelemer. DATA SOURCES: A literature search using the terms SP-303, Provir, and crofelemer was performed with PubMed (up to April 2010), Google Scholar, and selected Ovid bibliography searches. Additional references from the bibliographies of articles included in the search, as well as company and Food and Drug Administration Web sites, were also assessed. DATA EXTRACTION: English-language in vitro and clinical studies associated with the safety and efficacy of crofelemer were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Crofelemer is a first-in-class agent that may be useful for different types of secretory diarrhea, since it prevents chloride and fluid secretion into the bowel by directly inhibiting 2 distinct intestinal chloride channels. Crofelemer significantly brought about faster symptom resolution in patients with traveler's diarrhea, along with lower rates of treatment failure compared to placebo-treated patients. In a post hoc analysis, crofelemer compared to placebo also appears to have reduced abnormal stool weight and frequency in patients with AIDS-associated diarrhea. In a third trial, crofelemer did not offer a significant benefit in improving stool consistency after 12 weeks of treatment in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. However, a significant increase in pain-free days was noted in female patients. Preliminary studies also show that crofelemer may reduce watery stool output in patients with infectious diarrhea such as cholera. Oral crofelemer seemed to be well tolerated in clinical trials, with adverse effect profiles comparable to those with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Crofelemer possesses a novel mechanism of action that shows promise in treating secretory diarrhea of several etiologies. However, results from further Phase 3 clinical trials are still needed in order to fully evaluate the efficacy and safety of this agent.},

The present review addresses--besides some notes concerning the potential microbiota-hormone interactions--the first line with preventive and/or therapeutic applications of probiotic bacteria in order to maintain a balanced intestinal and urogenital flora, as well as in the case of irritable bowel syndrome, constipation (idiopathic slow-transit) and urogenital tract infections. Further aspects are the promotion of bone health and osteoporosis prevention brought about by inulin, oligofructose and galactooligosaccharides. Some further conditions, namely anorexia nervosa, the premenstrual syndrome as well as prevention or alleviation of climacteric and menopausal disorders, for which the use of probiotics is rather hypothetical or is largely studied by alternative medicine practising physicians, are addressed briefly.},

   abstract = {Probiotics exert distinct effects on the intestinal mucosa and the immune system that can be used in preventive and therapeutic settings. There is evidence to support the use of probiotics in necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants and pouchitis. Furthermore, the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics seem to ameliorate atopic diseases, in particular atopic dermatitis. The efficacy of probiotics has been shown comparable to Mesalazine regarding the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. In addition there is evidence that probiotics are useful in the prevention of pouchitis or in therapy of irritable bowel syndrome. Recent data indicate that commensals and probiotics could play a role in nutrient fermentation and energy metabolism and may be helpful in the prevention and therapy of obesity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postprandial symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have been associated with increased bowel contractility. AIM: To compare ileocolonic and colonic responses to feeding in health and IBS. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed data from separate research trials in 122 IBS patients and 41 healthy volunteers. Ileocolonic transit (ICT) was evaluated before (colonic filling [CF]3h) and immediately after (CF4 h) a standard lunch at 3 h 45 min, and 2 h thereafter. The colonic geometric center (GC) was calculated 2 h (GC6 h) after lunch ingested at 4 h (GC4 h) and directly after (GC8 h) a standard dinner ingested at 7 h 45 min. RESULTS: ICT immediately after eating was higher in IBS diarrhea predominant (IBS-D) patients than in the healthy cohort (23.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 17.5 +/- 2.8%, P = 0.059). ICT 2 h after lunch was similar between groups (P = 0.55). There was significant overall group differences in colonic transit 2 h post-lunch (P = 0.045), particularly in the IBS constipation predominant (IBS-C; GC6-GC4, delta 0.29 +/- 0.08) patients versus healthy volunteers (delta 0.56 +/- 0.12 GC units). CONCLUSIONS: After feeding, ICT is increased in IBS-D, whereas colonic transit is blunted in IBS-C.},

Patients were randomized to receive either B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 or placebo once a day for 8 weeks. Patients filled out a quality-of-life questionnaire, and self-assessment diaries were provided to record stool count and consistency, symptom severity, and medication consumption. Of the 61 patients enrolled, six did not meet the inclusion criteria and three were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 52 patients with IBS-D, the average number of bowel movements per day was significantly reduced for patients treated with B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 when compared to placebo (P = 0.042). Large variability in baseline scores prevented the assessment of severity scores and quality of life. This small pilot study provides evidence that the proprietary B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 probiotic is safe and effective for reducing daily bowel movements in patients with IBS-D.},

   abstract = {There is a growing need to understand from the patient's perspective the experience of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the factors contributing to its severity; this has been endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Accordingly, we conducted focus groups to address this issue. A total of 32 patients with mostly moderate to severe IBS were recruited through advertising and were allocated into three focus groups based on predominant stool pattern. The focus groups were held using standard methodology to obtain a general assessment of the symptoms experienced with IBS, its impact, and of factors associated with self-perceived severity. Patients described IBS not only as symptoms (predominantly abdominal pain) but mainly as it affects daily function, thoughts, feelings and behaviors. Common responses included uncertainty and unpredictability with loss of freedom, spontaneity and social contacts, as well as feelings of fearfulness, shame, and embarrassment. This could lead to behavioral responses including avoidance of activities and many adaptations in routine in an effort for patients to gain control. A predominant theme was a sense of stigma experienced because of a lack of understanding by family, friends and physicians of the effects of IBS on the individual, or the legitimacy of the individual's emotions and adaptation behaviors experienced. This was a barrier to normal functioning that could be ameliorated through identifying with others who could understand this situation. Severity was linked to health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and was influenced by the intensity of abdominal pain and other symptoms, interference with and restrictions relating to eating, work, and social activities, and of the unpredictability of the condition. This study confirms the heterogeneous and multi-component nature of IBS. These qualitative data can be used in developing health status and severity instruments for larger-scale studies.},

   abstract = {In irritable bowel syndrome, the main objectives of the treatment are the relief of abdominal pain then the improvement of bowel disturbances. Spasmolytic agents, or clays remain routinely the first line pharmacological options. The efficacy of dietary recommendations is not validated in most of the cases while dietary fibers, mainly insoluble fibers, may even worsen abdominal discomfort. In C-IBS, osmotic laxatives or macrogol are effective to improve colonic transit while loperamide and also colestyramine can be prescribed to reduce the number of stools of D-IBS patients. When the first line treatment fails to improve symptoms, antidepressants (tricyclic rather than SSRs) can be prescribed at lower doses than that recommended for depression. In meta-analysis, the odds ratio for pain relief varies from 2 to 4 and strongly depends on the patient's compliance to the treatment. Probiotics, pregabalin and even antibiotics (i.e neomycin, metronidazole or rifaximin), are possible new therapeutic options. Few clinical trials suggest that ramosetron (a new 5HT3 antagonist), octreotide, melatonin, or lidocain could be also discussed in the future. A non pharmacological therapeutic approach has to be considered, particularly in patients with severe symptoms, in combination with pharmacological treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous meta-analyses have recently assessed the overall clinical benefit of single therapy options and groups of therapies in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). By large, this should enable physicians to select from a number of therapy options available. METHODS: We entered dichotomous outcome data from 121 IBS trials published over the last 35 years with different groups and subgroups of drugs (antispasmodics, motility-affecting agents, antidepressants, peppermint oil), dietary interventions (bran, probiotics), and psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral, psychodynamic, hypnotherapy, relaxation techniques) into meta-analytic tools and estimate the overall efficacy (odds ratio, number needed to treat). RESULTS: Highest efficacy is currently found for peppermint oil, followed by psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions and probiotics. Traditional antispasmodic therapy has a moderate efficacy, whereas the list of (partially failed or cancelled) motility affecting drugs yielded weak clinical results, and therapies by bran and fibers are of no value in IBS. CONCLUSION: Evidence-based therapy in IBS provides a number of effective treatment options beyond the fact that many novel compounds under development have failed to reach the market. An algorithm for clinical therapy decision is proposed.},

METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-eight patients with lower abdominal symptoms diagnosed as IBS were treated for 8 weeks by the compound Symbioflor-2 (Symbiopharm GmbH, Herborn, Germany), an Escherichia coli product (N = 148), or placebo (n = 150) in a double-blinded, randomized fashion. Patients were seen weekly by the physician, who assessed the presence of core IBS symptoms. Both an abdominal pain score (APS) as well as a general symptom score (GSS) were used as primary endpoints. Responders had to have complete absence of IBS core symptoms at > or = 1 visit during treatment. RESULTS: The responder rate in GSS to the drug was 27 / 148 (18.2 %) in comparison to placebo with 7 / 150 (4.67 %) (p = 0.000397). The improvement in APS was 28 / 148 (18.9 %) and 10 / 150 (6.67 %) for placebo (p = 0.001649). The response was reached from visit 3 onwards with both medication and placebo. Post-hoc analysis revealed no significant differences in efficacy of the drug between the gender and different age groups. CONCLUSION: Treatment of IBS with the probiotic Symbioflor-2 is effective and superior to placebo in reducing typical symptoms of IBS patients seen by general practitioners and by gastroenterologists.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Serotonin transporter (SERT) plays a critical role in regulating serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) availability in the gut. Elevated 5-HT levels are associated with diarrheal conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and enteric infections. Whether alteration in SERT activity contributes to the pathophysiology of diarrhea induced by the food-borne pathogen enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is not known. The present studies examined the effects of EPEC infection on SERT activity and expression in intestinal epithelial cells and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Caco-2 cells as a model of human intestinal epithelia and EPEC-infected C57BL/6J mouse model of infection were utilized. SERT activity was measured as Na(+) and Cl(-) dependent (3)[H] 5-HT uptake. SERT expression was measured by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence studies. RESULTS: Infection of Caco-2 cells with EPEC for 30-120 minutes decreased apical SERT activity (P < .001) in a type 3 secretion system dependent manner and via involvement of protein tyrosine phosphatases. EPEC infection decreased V(max) of the transporter; whereas cell surface biotinylation studies revealed no alteration in the cellular or plasma membrane content of SERT in Caco-2 cells. EPEC infection of mice (24 hours) reduced SERT immunostaining with a corresponding decrease in SERT messenger RNA levels, 5-HT uptake, and mucosal 5-HT content in the small intestine. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate inhibition of SERT by EPEC and define the mechanisms underlying these effects. These data may aid in the development of a novel pharmacotherapy to modulate the serotonergic system in treatment of infectious diarrheal diseases.},

   abstract = {AIM: Nutritional changes are often considered first-line treatment in public health diseases that apply to many gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, as different food and beverages may modulate GI motor and sensory functions, and may provoke GI symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine dietary coping and possible changes in food and beverage intake in relation to GI symptoms reported by identified irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients compared with healthy controls, and whether any sex differences were observed in these respects. METHODS: A population-based case-control design was used. Three primary healthcare centres were selected in the city of Linkoping in Sweden. The IBS patients were recruited from the studied primary healthcare centers on the basis of diagnoses from computerized medical records. The controls were randomly selected from the general population in the same region. A questionnaire was used with specific questions about self-reported food and beverage increase or decrease of GI symptoms and self-reported changes in dietary habits. RESULTS: Female IBS patients seem to be more willing to change dietary habits because of their GI problems than men. Effects of these nutritional behaviour changes were reported for almost all participants that had made dietary adjustments. Fatty food, certain vegetables, dairy products and eggs were significantly more reported to cause GI complaints among IBS patients compared with their controls. CONCLUSION: Female IBS patients reported more changes in their dietary habits because of GI problems than men with the disease. The majority of both women and men who changed their dietary habits because of GI problems experienced improvement in their symptoms.},

This malabsorption is sometimes associated with abdominal complaints and diarrhea development, symptoms indistinguishable from those of functional bowel disease. Recently, polymerized forms of fructose (fructans) also were implicated in symptom production in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Evidence from uncontrolled and controlled challenge studies suggests that malabsorbed sugars (fructose, sorbitol, lactose) and fructans may act as dietary triggers for clinical symptoms suggestive of IBS. Further placebo-controlled studies are needed to obtain definite conclusions about the role of dietary sugar malabsorption in functional bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To date no studies have compared generic health-related quality of life (HRQL) of food allergic patients from childhood to adulthood with that of the general population or patients with other chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to compare generic HRQL of food allergic patients with the general population and other diseases. METHODS: Generic HRQL questionnaires (CHQ-CF87 and RAND-36) were completed by 79 children, 74 adolescents and 72 adults with food allergy. The generic HRQL scores were compared with scores from published studies on the general population and patients with asthma, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), diabetes mellitus (DM) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RESULTS: Food allergic children and adolescents reported fewer limitations in school work due to behavioural problems (P < or = 0.013), but food allergic adolescents and adults reported more pain (P = 0.020), poorer overall health (P < 0.001), more limitations in social activities (P < 0.001) and less vitality (P = 0.002) than individuals from the general population. Food allergic patients reported poorer generic HRQL than patients with DM, but better generic HRQL than patients with RA, asthma and IBS. CONCLUSION: HRQL is impaired in food allergic adolescents and adults, compared to the general population, and it is intermediate in magnitude between DM and RA, asthma and IBS. Children show the least impact on generic HRQL from food allergy.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) varies depending on the criteria used to diagnose it, but it ranges from about 5% to 20%. IBS is associated with abnormal gastrointestinal motor function and enhanced visceral perception, as well as psychosocial and genetic factors. People with IBS often have other bodily and psychiatric symptoms, and have an increased likelihood of having unnecessary surgery compared with people without IBS. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with IBS? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 18 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: 5HT(3) receptor antagonists (alosetron and ramosetron); 5HT(4) receptor agonists (tegaserod); antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]); antispasmodics (including peppermint oil); cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); hypnotherapy; soluble and insoluble fibre supplementation; and loperamide.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine whether Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) relieves symptoms in children with recurrent abdominal pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 141 children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or functional pain were enrolled in 9 primary care sites and a referral center. Children entered a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and received LGG or placebo for 8 weeks and entered follow-up for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was overall pain at the end of the intervention period. At entry and at the end of the trial, children underwent a double-sugar intestinal permeability test. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, LGG, but not placebo, caused a significant reduction of both frequency (P < .01) and severity (P < .01) of abdominal pain. These differences still were significant at the end of follow-up (P < .02 and P < .001, respectively). At week 12, treatment success was achieved in 48 children in the LGG group compared with 37 children in the placebo group (P < .03); this difference still was present at the end of follow-up (P < .03). At entry, 59% of the children had abnormal results from the intestinal permeability test; LGG, but not placebo, determined a significant decrease in the number of patients with abnormal results from the intestinal permeability testing (P < .03). These effects mainly were in children with IBS. CONCLUSIONS: LGG significantly reduces the frequency and severity of abdominal pain in children with IBS; this effect is sustained and may be secondary to improvement of the gut barrier.},

The first patient was a 49-year-old woman presenting with epigastric pain and bloody vomiting after ingestion of marinated (vinegar) raw anchovies. During the esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) a white color worm was detected and extracted from cardia by means of biopsy forceps. The second patient was a 59-year-old woman with irritable bowel syndrome and gastritis, who underwent to periodical EGDSs. In the course of the last EGDS, a white color round worm on antrum and a small polyp on the fundus of the stomach were observed. The two nematodes have been identified as L3 larvae of the genus Anisakis by a light microscope, and as Anisakis pegreffi by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The molecular identification of the etiological agent at the species level allows to identify what Anisakidae species play a zoonotic role and which are the fish host species.},

For most people the discomfort is minor and transitory, but for some it can cause regular unpleasant symptoms, such as bloating. More severe gastrointestinal conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can have a significant impact on health and wellbeing. There are relatively few options for people with digestive discomfort and/or IBS. In recent years the body of evidence to support the health benefits of consuming probiotics has grown significantly. This article investigates how certain strains of probiotics have been shown to reduce digestive discomfort and symptoms of IBS.

   abstract = {Recently, there has been strong interest in the therapeutic potential of probiotics for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). At the same time, there is a rapidly growing body of evidence to support an etiological role for gastrointestinal infection and the associated immune activation in the development of post-infectious IBS. In a more controversial area, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth has been associated with a subset of patients with IBS; the issue of whether it is appropriate to treat a subset of IBS patients with antibiotics and probiotics is currently a matter for debate. Thus, it appears that the gastrointestinal microbial flora may exert beneficial effects for symptoms of IBS under some circumstances, while in other situations gut microbes could give rise to symptoms of IBS. How do we make sense of the apparently diverse roles that 'bugs' may play in IBS? To address this question, we have conducted an in-depth review, attempting where possible to draw lessons from Asian studies.},

Thus far, they have shown particular promise on prevention or treatment of various pathologic conditions. Our aim has been to report the most recent articles (until October 2008), resulting from randomized, double controlled trials, according to the conventional and molecular methods. In this review we have taken into consideration almost all the fields in which the probiotics have been given, either with a prophylactic or therapeutic intent. So far we have summarized the actual results concerning lactose intolerance, acute rotavirus diarrhea, traveller's diarrhea, antibiotic associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection, and the role as adjuvant in Helicobacter pylori eradication. Furthermore, we have synthesised articles concerning the probiotic connection in irritable bowel syndrome, and in inflammatory bowel diseases. Last but not least, the prevention by probiotics of allergic diseases, of bacterial vaginosis, of respiratory infections, and the possible advantage in hypercholesteremic subjects.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder with a clinical diagnosis. The prevalence of this disorder and associated factors are unknown among the Colombian population. Nowadays, diagnosis of IBS is made by applying the Rome III criteria, and other disorders should be excluded before establishing the diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of IBS and associated factors in a population aged between 18 and 60 years old in Bucaramanga, Colombia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed. We applied a questionnaire that included sociodemographic variables, types of food, identification of IBS by the Rome III criteria, the Zung self-rating depression scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) test and self-reported use of medical services among a random sample of an adult population in Bucaramanga. Univariate analysis and logistic regression was used to establish associations. RESULTS: Of the 615 individuals selected, 558 were included in the study. The mean age was 36.4 years and 62.4% was female. The prevalence of IBS was 19.9%. Logistic regression analysis showed an association with depressive symptoms and female sex independently of age and anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IBS is high and is associated with depressive symptoms and female sex in an adult population in Colombia. This disorder generates substantial health system utilization and medical disability and restricts activities of daily life.},

   abstract = {Rice- and chili-containing foods are common in Asia. Studies suggest that rice is completely absorbed in the small bowel, produces little intestinal gas and has a low allergenicity. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that rice-based meals are well tolerated and may improve gastrointestinal symptoms in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). Chili is a spicy ingredient commonly use throughout Asia. The active component of chili is capsaicin. Capsaicin can mediate a painful, burning sensation in the human gut via the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1). Recently, the TRPV1 expressing sensory fibers have been reported to increase in the gastrointestinal tract of patients with FGID and visceral hypersensitivity. Acute exposure to capsaicin or chili can aggravate abdominal pain and burning in dyspepsia and IBS patients. Whereas, chronic ingestion of natural capsaicin agonist or chili has been shown to decrease dyspeptic and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. The high prevalence of spicy food in Asia may modify gastrointestinal burning symptoms in patients with FGID. Studies in Asia demonstrated a low prevalence of heartburn symptoms in GERD patients in several Asian countries. In conclusion rice is well tolerated and should be advocated as the carbohydrate source of choice for patients with FGID. Although, acute chili ingestion can aggravate abdominal pain and burning symptoms in FGID, chronic ingestion of chili was found to improve functional dyspepsia and GERD symptoms in small randomized, controlled studies.},

However, the effect of chili ingestion on gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS patients has not been characterized. To study the effect of chili-containing foods on postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms in diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), 20 IBS-D patients underwent gastrointestinal symptoms and postprandial colonic transit evaluations after ingesting three different meals: (i) a standard meal, (ii) a spicy meal (a standard meal mixed with 2 g chili), and (iii) a standard meal with 2 g chili in capsules, in a randomized crossover fashion. Postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms were scored every 15 min for 2 h using visual analogue scales. Thirty-eight healthy volunteers were used as controls. In healthy volunteers, the spicy meals and meals with chili capsules induced only mild abdominal burning relative to the standard meals (P < 0.05), whereas it induced significant levels of abdominal pain and burning in IBS-D patients (P < 0.05). Other gastrointestinal symptoms and postprandial colonic transit after spicy meals and meals with chili capsules did not differ from standard meals in IBS-D and controls (P > 0.05). Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients and controls reported similar oral burning symptoms when eating spicy meals (P > 0.05). Both the spicy meal and the standard meal with chili capsules led to similar severity of gastrointestinal symptoms (P > 0.05). Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients exhibit gut hypersensitivity to chili. Chili ingestion produced more abdominal pain and burning in IBS-D patients than in healthy volunteers, but was associated with similar oral burning symptoms.},

Twenty-six patients with subjective food hypersensitivity, of whom 25 had irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), were included in the present study.

Compared with baseline, gastrointestinal, as well as nongastrointestinal, complaints and QoL improved significantly, both at end of treatment and 1 month posttreatment. The consistent improvements following seal oil administration warrant further placebo-controlled trials for confirmation of effect.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Few randomized studies have been carried out on adult patients affected by acute diarrhea especially in primary care, which is the natural context for this kind of disorder. Lactobacillus paracasei B 21060 is a novel strain of lactobacillus, which has been shown to be effective in relieving symptoms associated with diarrhea of irritable bowel syndrome subtype and in shortening diarrhea duration. In this study, we compared the therapeutic efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a new symbiotic formulation, Flortec, containing L. paracasei B-21060, with lactobacillus GG (FlorVis GG) in the treatment of acute presumed infectious diarrhea. METHODS: Fourteen general practitioners working in the Perugia health authority district carried out a randomized controlled, parallel-group, open trial in 174 adult patients suffering from acute diarrhea (87 enrolled in the Flortec group and 87 in the FlorVis group). Both the products were administered according to their standard recommended dosage. The main efficacy criterion was the duration of diarrhea after beginning treatment. Treatment duration was 10 days. Enrolled patients kept a careful track of their symptoms noting them in a personal diary for 12 days. RESULTS: The 2 groups resulted to be homogeneous at baseline with regard to prognostic variables. The mean duration of diarrhea from the start of treatment in the Flortec group was 4.24 (2.73 SD) days versus 5.09 (3.72 SD) days in the FlorVis group (P=0.09).Clinical success rates in terms of absence of abdominal pain and absence of diarrhea (defined as <2 bowel movements of watery or loose stool consistency) recorded at different time-points were statistically superior in the Flortec group (Kaplan-Meyer P=0.05 for both the symptoms). The physician judged that overall efficacy was good or very good in 91.8% of the patients in the Flortec group. The corresponding value in the FlorVis group was 83.7% (P=0.003). The 2 treatments showed a very good tolerability profile, with negligible and similar adverse event rates and similar concomitant medication usage rates. CONCLUSIONS: Oral therapy with Flortec proved to be more effective than FlorVis GG in the treatment of acute diarrhea in adults treated at a primary care setting.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: : Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common problem in pediatrics, for which no safe and effective treatment is available. Probiotics have shown some promising results in adult studies, but no positive study has been published on pediatric age. We aimed at investigating the efficacy of VSL#3 in a population of children and teenagers affected by IBS, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study conducted in 7 pediatric gastroenterology divisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: : Children 4 to 18 years of age, meeting eligibility criteria, were enrolled. The patients were assessed by a questionnaire for a 2-week baseline period. They were then randomized to receive either VSL#3 or a placebo for 6 weeks, with controls every 2 weeks. At the end, after a "wash-out" period of 2 weeks, each patient was switched to the other group and followed for a further 6 weeks. RESULTS: : A total of 59 children completed the study. Although placebo was effective in some of the parameters and in as many as half of the patients, VSL#3 was significantly superior to it (P < 0.05) in the primary endpoint, the subjective assessment of relief of symptoms; as well as in 3 of 4 secondary endpoints: abdominal pain/discomfort (P < 0.05), abdominal bloating/gassiness (P < 0.05), and family assessment of life disruption (P < 0.01). No significant difference was found (P = 0.06) in the stool pattern. No untoward adverse effect was recorded in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: : VSL#3 is safe and more effective than placebo in ameliorating symptoms and improving the quality of life in children affected by IBS.},

   abstract = {Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized as a chronic, painful, noninflammatory syndrome affecting the musculoskeletal system. In addition to pain, common co-morbid symptoms associated with FM include sleep disturbances, fatigue, morning stiffness, affective disorders, chronic daily headache, dyscognition, irritable bowel syndrome, and irritable bladder. Fibromyalgia is usually classified by application of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Although these criteria are accepted among investigators who agree with the concept of fibromyalgia, they do so with some reservations. Tender points and widespread pain alone does not describe the esence of fibromyalgia. New diagnostic tools including either clinical or radiological components are studied to diminish these problems. Although various pharmacological solutions have been studied for treating fibromyalgia, no single drug or groups of drugs have proved to be useful in treating fibromyalgia patients. Recently, three drugs, pregabalin, duloxetine and milnacipran, were approved for the treatment of FM by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Novel therapeutic approaches to the management of FM include cannabinoids, sodium channel blockade and new generation antiepileptics. This review evaluates both new diagnostic tools, including clinical or radiological regimes, and tries to highlight the efficacy of medicinal and nonmedicinal treatments with new therapeutic approaches in the management of FM with a wide perspective.},

The objective of this pilot study was to investigate the effect of consuming fermented milk containing the probiotics Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173010 and yoghourt strains (test product) on digestive comfort and symptoms amongst adults without diagnosed gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: The study was designed to approximate a real-life situation, by using a branded product in the intervention groups. In an open-label, randomized, controlled trial, 371 adults reporting digestive discomfort were randomized into three groups who had a daily consumption of either one or two pots of test product over 2 weeks, or to follow their usual diet. Digestive comfort and bother from digestive symptoms were assessed by questionnaire at baseline and follow-up (per protocol population n = 360). Self-reported change in digestive comfort and computed change between baseline and follow-up for each of 20 items were compared between groups (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test). RESULTS: A higher percentage of participants consuming the test product reported improved digestive comfort (1-pot group 82.5%; 2-pot group 84.3%), than controls (2.9%). Their self-reported change scores differed significantly (P < 0.001). For both test product groups, almost all symptom scores improved significantly more than controls (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences between 1-pot and 2-pot groups. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows that daily consumption of a probiotic food in real-life conditions may be useful in improving digestive comfort and symptom experience of adults from general population. Further double-blind randomized controlled studies are required to confirm these health benefits.},

Selected probiotics strains have been proven to be clinically effective in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. None of the probiotics thus far tested has been shown to be effective in induction of remission or in maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease. The multispecies probiotics mixture of 8 strains seems effective in the maintenance of remission in pouchitis. Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional bowel disorder manifested by chronic, recurring abdominal pain or discomfort associated with disturbed bowel habit in the absence of structural abnormalities likely to account for these symptoms. Recently conducted appropriately powered studies with different (combinations of) probiotics show positive results on reduction of symptoms, although a considerable placebo effect is also found. Mechanistic studies aimed at pathophysiological mechanisms of inflammatory bowel diseases can identify new targets for probiotic bacteria.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) may occur following acute gastroenteritis. This long-term complication has previously not been described after infection with the non-invasive protozoan Giardia lamblia. This study aims to characterize persistent abdominal symptoms elicited by Giardia infection according to Rome II criteria and symptoms scores. METHODS: Structured interview and questionnaires 12-30 months after the onset of Giardia infection, and at least 6 months after Giardia eradication, among 82 patients with persisting abdominal symptoms elicited by the Giardia infection. All had been evaluated to exclude other causes. RESULTS: We found that 66 (80.5%) of the 82 patients had symptoms consistent with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 17 (24.3%) patients had functional dyspepsia (FD) according to Rome II criteria. IBS was sub classified into D-IBS (47.0%), A-IBS (45.5%) and C-IBS (7.6%). Bloating, diarrhoea and abdominal pain were reported to be most severe. Symptoms exacerbation related to specific foods were reported by 45 (57.7%) patients and to physical or mental stress by 34 (44.7%) patients. CONCLUSION: In the presence of an IBS-subtype pattern consistent with post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS), and in the absence of any other plausible causes, we conclude that acute Giardia infection may elicit functional gastrointestinal diseases with food and stress related symptoms similar to FGID patients in general.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to assess the effects and tolerability of two novel natural medicine formulations in improving bowel habit and abdominal symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The DA-IBS formula was designed to treat diarrhea-predominant and alternating bowel habit IBS, and the C-IBS formula was designed to treat constipation-predominant IBS. DESIGN: This was a two arm, open-label, uncontrolled pilot study. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Subjects were recruited from the greater Lismore area (NSW, Australia) in 2001. SUBJECTS: The study included 31 patients who fulfilled the Rome II criteria for IBS. Twenty-one (21) patients were classified as suffering from diarrhea-predominant or alternating bowel habit IBS and 10 patients were classified with constipation-predominant IBS. INTERVENTIONS: The DA-IBS formula consisted of a mixture of dried, powdered bilberry fruit, slippery elm bark, agrimony aerial parts, and cinnamon quills. The C-IBS formula consisted of a mixture of dried powdered slippery elm bark, lactulose, oat bran, and licorice root. The aim of each formula was to normalize stool frequency and stool consistency. RESULTS: Ingestion of the DA-IBS formula was associated with a small, but significant increase in bowel movement frequency (p = 0.027). Subjects in the DA-IBS group also experienced reductions in straining (p = 0.004), abdominal pain (p = 0.006), bloating (p < 0.0001), flatulence (p = 0.0001), and global IBS symptoms (p = 0.002) during the treatment phase of the trial. Subjects in the C-IBS group experienced a 20% increase in bowel movement frequency (p = 0.016) and significant reductions in straining (p < 0.0001), abdominal pain (p = 0.032), bloating (p = 0.034), and global IBS symptom severity (p = 0.0005), as well as improvements in stool consistency (p < 0.0001). Both formulas were well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The DA-IBS formula was not effective in improving bowel habit in individuals with diarrhea-predominant or alternating bowel habit IBS, although it did significantly improve a number of IBS symptoms. The C-IBS formula significantly improved both bowel habit and IBS symptoms in patients with constipation-predominant IBS. Further research is warranted on C-IBS, as a potentially useful therapeutic formula.},

   abstract = {This review summarizes what is known about the effect of diet on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms emphasizing data from randomized, controlled clinical trials. Studies suggest that IBS symptoms in one quarter of patients may be caused or exacerbated by one or more dietary components. Recent studies indicate that a diet restricted in fermentable, poorly absorbed carbohydrates, including fructose, fructans (present in wheat and onions), sorbitol, and other sugar alcohols is beneficial, but confirmatory studies are needed. Despite a long history of enthusiastic use, fiber is marginally beneficial. Insoluble fiber may worsen symptoms. Some patients with IBS, especially those with constipation, will improve with increased intake of soluble fiber. Prebiotic fibers have not been adequately tested. Daily use of peppermint oil is effective in relieving IBS symptoms. The usefulness of probiotics in the form of foods such as live-culture yogurt and buttermilk for IBS symptoms is not established. In clinical practice, it is very difficult to establish that a patient's symptoms result from an adverse reaction to food. A double blind placebo-controlled food challenge is the most reliable method, but it is not suitable for routine clinical use. A modified exclusion diet and stepwise reintroduction of foods or trials of eliminating classes of food may be useful.},

   abstract = {Gastrointestinal (GI) motility, primarily gastric emptying, balances the hormonal output that takes place after food intake in order to maintain stable blood sugar. The incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), work together to reduce postprandial hyperglycemia by glucose-dependent insulin secretion and inhibition of glucagon release, as well as inhibition of GI motility and gastric emptying. GLP-1 is considered the more effective of the two incretins due to its additional inhibitory effects on GI motility. It is observed that patients on treatment with GLP-1 analogues or exenatide achieve a considerable weight loss during treatment. This is of benefit to improve insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, weight loss per se is of considerable benefit in an even longer health perspective. The weight loss is considered to be due to the inhibition of GI motility. This effect has been studied in animal experimentation, and from there taken to involve studies on GI motility in healthy volunteers and patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Evolving to a phase II study in IBS, the GLP-1 analogue (ROSE-010) was recently shown to be effective for treatment of acute pain attacks in IBS. Taken together, data speak in favor of GI motility as a central component not only in metabolic disorders but also in IBS, be it due to a direct relaxing effect on GI smooth muscle or a slow emptying of gastric contents resulting in a less outspoken nutritional demand on hormonal regulatory functions in the GI tract.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder and the evidence for efficacy of most drug therapies in the treatment of IBS is weak. A popular alternative is probiotics, which have been used in several conditions. including IBS. Probiotics are live microbial food supplements.The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials study was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in alleviating symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. We searched Ovid versions of MEDLINE (1950-2007), EMBASE (1980-2007), CINAHL (1982-2007), AMED (1985-2007), the Cochrane library and hand searched retrieved papers. RESULTS: We identified 14 randomized placebo controlled trials. Combined data suggested a modest improvement in overall symptoms after several weeks of treatment: for dichotomous data from seven trials the overall Odds Ratio (OR) was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.2); for continuous data from six trials the standardised mean difference (SMD) was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.38).For individual symptoms the results differed between the pooled dichotomous and pooled continuous data. Trials varied in relation to the length of treatment (4-26 weeks), dose, organisms and strengths of probiotics used. CONCLUSION: Probiotics may have a role in alleviating some of the symptoms of IBS, a condition for which currently evidence of efficacy of drug therapies is weak. However, as IBS is a condition that is chronic and usually intermittent longer term trials are recommended. Such research should focus on the type, optimal dose of probiotics and the subgroups of patients who are likely to benefit the most.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Between 4% and 25% of school-age children complain of recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) of sufficient severity to interfere with daily activities. It is unclear whether the diagnosis includes children with different aetiologies for their pain. For the majority no organic cause for their pain can be found on physical examination or investigation. Although most children are likely managed by reassurance and simple measures, a large range of interventions have been recommended. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of dietary interventions for recurrent abdominal pain in school-age children. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) 2006 (Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2006), EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2006), CINAHL (1982 to Dec 2007), ERIC (1966 to Dec 2006), PsycINFO (1872 to Dec 2006), LILACS (1982 to Dec 2006), SIGLE (1980 to March 2005), and JICST (1985 to 06/2000) were searched . Where appropriate, search filters were employed. Researchers working in this area were asked to identify relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised studies of any dietary treatment versus placebo or no treatment in school-age children with a diagnosis of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorder based on the Rome II criteria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed quality and extracted data. Where appropriate studies were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Seven trials were included in this review. Two trials, including 83 participants, compared fibre supplements with placebo (Christensen 1982, Feldman 1985), with data from one study reported in two papers (Christensen 1982, Christensen 1986). The pooled odds ratio for improvement in the frequency of abdominal pain was 1.26 (0.25, 6.29). Two trials, including 90 participants (Lebenthal 1981, Dearlove 1983) compared lactose-containing with lactose-free diets. Neither reported data in a form which could be used in the meta-analysis and the former trial had a loss to follow-up of 45%. We were not able to obtain further data for either trial. Three trials (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007, Young 1997) comparing supplementation with Lactobacillus with placebo met the inclusion criteria but only two (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007), including a total of 168 children, provided analysable data. The pooled odds ratio for improvement of symptoms was 1.17 (95% CI 0.62, 2.21). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of high quality evidence on the effectiveness of dietary interventions. This review provides no evidence that fibre supplements, lactose free diets or lactobacillus supplementation are effective in the management of children with RAP.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can have a profound impact on emotional health and quality of life, and current treatments are sometimes unsatisfactory for patients facing this lifelong disease. Probiotics, which can normalize gastrointestinal microflora, may alleviate symptoms of IBS. OBJECTIVE: This preliminary controlled study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the probiotic Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 on IBS symptoms. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 44 subjects who received either placebo or B coagulans GBI-30, 6086 once a day for 8 weeks. Self-assessments of the severity of IBS symptoms (abdominal pain and bloating) were recorded every day for 8 weeks. Because baseline values were significantly different between the 2 study groups, within-group analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Improvements from baseline abdominal pain and bloating scores in the B coagulans GBI-30, 6086 group were statistically significant for all 7 weekly comparisons (P < 0.01). In the placebo group, only changes in abdominal pain scores at weeks 6 and 8 achieved statistical significance (P < 0.05). No treatment-related adverse events or serious adverse events were reported during the 8-week study period. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data suggest that the patented B coagulans GBI-30, 6086 probiotic may be a safe and effective option for the relief of abdominal pain and bloating for patients with IBS. Larger, extended trials are needed to verify these results.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in man is not a single entity but has several causes. One of the most common forms has similarities with colic and laminitis in horses. Undigested food residues may pass from the small intestine into the colon where bacterial fermentation produces chemicals that lead to disease. In horses the consequences may be disastrous, but in healthy humans such malabsorption may not be harmful. After events such as bacterial gastroenteritis or antibiotic treatment, an imbalance of the colonic microflora with overgrowth of facultative anaerobes may arise, leading to malfermentation and IBS. It is not known whether such subtle changes may likewise be present in the microflora of horses who are susceptible to colic and laminitis. Metabolomic studies of urine and faeces may provide a suitable way forward to identify such changes in the horse's gut and thus help to identify more accurately those at risk and to provide opportunities for the development of improved treatment.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Lactose stimulates proliferation and colonization of acidophilic bacteria, which due to fermentation processes lower colonic pH and simplified absorption of some microelements from the intestine. However, the common problem in children is intolerance of this carbohydrate. Treatment, quite simple, is based on partial or total elimination of lactose from diet. Some substitutional products with equivalent nutritional value should be introduced to prevent deficiencies symptoms during lactose-free diet. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY: Determination of milk and dairy products consumption and their connection with lactose malabsorption or lactose intolerance in children above 5 years of age in selected disorders of the alimentary tract: food allergy, celiac disease, secondary enteropathy, functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and deficiency of body weight and height. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The number of 301 patients above 5 years of age (135 boys and 166 girls; mean age 11.5 years) were included into the study. Milk and dairy products consumption habits, lactose intolerance symptoms, hydrogen breath test, activity of lactase and villous atrophy were investigated. RESULTS: Decreased sweet milk consumption from, 33.33% in children with food allergy to 55.38% in children with functional indigestion was observed, in spite of gastrointestinal complaints after ingestion of milk. The biggest lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance frequency was observed in children with decreased sweet milk consumption due to complaints after ingestion of milk and in children who didn't drink milk. There were no statistically significant difference between frequency of lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance symptoms in children with different dairy products consumption habits. There were no statistically significant difference between frequency of hypolactasia in children with different sweet milk or dairy products consumption habits. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent (33-55%) decreased sweet milk consumption in children in spite of clinical symptoms after ingestion of milk was observed. The biggest lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance symptoms frequency was observed in children who didn't drink milk and in children with decreased consumption of sweet milk due to complaints after ingestion of milk. There were no statistically significant difference between frequency of lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance in children with different dairy products consumption habits.},

Although for some of them an effective therapeutic approach has been found, palliation rather than cure is very frequent due to a partial knowledge of their aetiology and pathogenesis. This review, analyzing the main clinical studies, aims at being a state of the art update of the use of probiotic formulations in daily practice. METHODS: In this review we include all the most significant clinical trials involving the use of probiotic formulations for the treatment of several pathologies. RESULTS: Dysbiosis has been observed in irritable bowel syndrome patients. Probiotics may exert a beneficial effect on Crohn's disease affected patients who have shown gut microbiota antigens and altered wall permeability. Moreover some probiotic formulations seem to enhance the therapy for Helicobacter Pylori reducing its pathogenic potential. Intestinal ecology imbalance has been also linked to cancer induction, allergy, skin and urogenital diseases. In addition probiotics administration seems to be particularly useful to ease post-operative complications. CONCLUSION: Further future clinical trials, involving large numbers of patients, will be mandatory to achieve definite evidence of the preventive and curative role of probiotics in medical practice.},

In a randomized, double-blind trial, faeces were collected from healthy volunteers, and from patients with active CD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable bowel syndrome before and after treatment. The levels of F. prausnitzii DNA in faecal suspensions were determined by PCR. Treatment by an elemental diet was effective, resulting in decreases in both the Harvey and Bradshaw index (P<0.001) and the concentrations of serum C-reactive protein (P<0.05). The total levels of F. prausnitzii in faecal samples from CD patients at presentation were lower than those in the other groups both before and after the treatment. There was no correlation between F. prausnitzii abundance and the severity of CD before treatment. Clinical improvement unexpectedly correlated with a significant decrease in the abundance of F. prausnitzii, especially the A2-165 subgroup (P<0.05). Our data suggest that a paucity of F. prausnitzii in the gastrointestinal microbial communities is likely to be a minor aetiological factor in CD: recovery following elemental diet is attributed to lower levels of gut flora.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Food and Drug Administration, currently, is exploring quantitative benefit-risk methods to support regulatory decision-making. A scientifically valid method for assessing patients' benefit-risk trade-off preferences is needed to compare risks and benefits in a common metric. OBJECTIVES: The study aims to quantify the maximum acceptable risk (MAR) of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) that women with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are willing to accept in exchange for symptom relief. METHODS: RESEARCH DESIGN: A stated-choice survey was used to elicit trade-off preferences among constructed treatment profiles, each defined by symptom severity and treatment-related AEs. Symptom attributes included frequency of abdominal pain and discomfort, frequency of diarrhea, and frequency of urgency. AE attributes included frequency of mild-to-moderate constipation and the risk of four possible serious AEs. SUBJECTS: A Web-enabled survey was administered to 589 female US residents at least 18 years of age with a self-reported diagnosis of diarrhea-predominant IBS. MEASURES: Preference weights and MAR were estimated using mixed-logit methods. RESULTS: SUBJECTS were willing to accept higher risks of serious AEs in return for treatments offering better symptom control. For an improvement from the lowest to the highest of four benefit levels, subjects were willing to tolerate a 2.65% increase in impacted-bowel risk, but only a 1.34% increase in perforated-bowel risk. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in MARs across AE types is consistent with the relative seriousness of the AEs. Stated-preference methods offer a scientifically valid approach to quantifying benefit-risk trade-off preferences that can be used to inform regulatory decision-making.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common health issue that is characterized by abdominal pain, abnormal bowel movements, altered visceral perception, and abnormal metabolism of 5-hydroxy triptamine (serotonin; 5HT). The use of prebiotics or probiotics treatment for IBS has become increasingly important as an adjunct to pharmaceutical options. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of enzyme-treated rice fiber (ERF) on an IBS model. We obtained a new prebiotic from defatted rice bran that was developed as an insoluble dietary fiber through amylase and hemicellulase treatment followed by removal of the soluble fraction. Containing approximately 70% hemicellulose, ERF is utilized by lactobacilli and subsequently converted to butyrate using Eubacterium limosum. We employed a restraint stress IBS model which involved the continuous application of stress for 4 h per day for 3 days. Polycarbophil Ca (PC) (500 mg/kg body weight) was used as a positive control and ERF was added to the diet at 4% in diet. During restraint stress, ERF significantly attenuated urgent fecal excretion, colonic mucosal 5HT secretion, and hyperalgesthesia compared with the control. ERF also significantly increased cecal butyrate production as well as total organic acid content. PC was only effective in regard to preventing increases in 5HT levels. Furthermore, there were no significant levels of pro-inflammatory markers CINC-1 and TNF-alpha among the groups. Although more detailed studies are needed, the ERF prebiotic demonstrated potency in attenuating major symptoms of IBS.},

   abstract = {Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) are quite heterogeneous category of an emerging enteric pathogen associated with cases of acute or persistent diarrhea worldwide in children and adults, and over the past decade has received increasing attention as a cause of watery diarrhea, which is often persistent. EAEC infection is an important cause of diarrhea in outbreak and non-outbreak settings in developing and developed countries. Recently, EAEC has been implicated in the development of irritable bowel syndrome, but this remains to be confirmed. EAEC is defined as a diarrheal pathogen based on its characteristic aggregative adherence (AA) to HEp-2 cells in culture and its biofilm formation on the intestinal mucosa with a "stacked-brick" adherence phenotype, which is related to the presence of a 60 MDa plasmid (pAA). At the molecular level, strains demonstrating the aggregative phenotype are quite heterogeneous; several virulence factors are detected by polymerase chain reaction; however, none exhibited 100% specificity. Although several studies have identified specific virulence factor(s) unique to EAEC, the mechanism by which EAEC exerts its pathogenesis is, thus, far unknown. The present review updates the current knowledge on the epidemiology, chronic complications, detection, virulence factors, and treatment of EAEC, an emerging enteric food borne pathogen.},

By contrast, chronic disturbances of small intestinal, colonic and anorectal motility and/or sensitivity are subject to gastrointestinal function tests.

   abstract = {Cryptosporidium spp. are a cause of self-limited diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts. In immunocompetent rats, Cryptosporidium parvum infection induced digestive hypersensitivity, a key pathophysiological factor in functional digestive disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In such a rat model, we sought to document whether jejunal hypersensitivity depends on C. parvum isolate and is associated with a mast cell accumulation. Five-day-old rats were orally administered 10(5) oocysts of either Nouzilly (NoI) or Iowa (IoI) C. parvum isolate. NoI-infected rats exhibited the lowest food intake on days 7 and 14 postinfection (p.i.). On day 7 p.i., small intestine villus atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and inflammatory cell infiltration were prominent in NoI-infected rats, with higher numbers of Cryptosporidium forms than in IoI-infected rats. Compared to uninfected control rats, jejunal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were increased only in NoI-infected rats on day 14 p.i. On day 50 p.i., jejunal hypersensitivity to distension was found only in NoI-infected rats; this hypersensitivity is associated with activated mast cell accumulation. The number of mast cells in the jejunal lamina propria was increased from day 36 p.i. in NoI-infected rats and only at day 120 p.i. in IoI-infected rats. Our data suggest that both the severity of infection (weight loss, reduced food intake, villus atrophy, and IEL accumulation) and the onset of a jejunal hypersensitivity after infection in association with an activated mast cell accumulation are isolate dependent and related to NoI infection. This cryptosporidiosis rat model is a relevant model for the study of underlying mechanisms of postinfectious IBS-like symptoms.},

   abstract = {IBS is a common gastrointestinal condition characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits. IBS is considered a functional bowel disorder (that is, not defined by structural or biochemical abnormalities) and is diagnosed using symptom-based criteria. Limited and judicious use of diagnostic testing is recommended, particularly in patients with typical symptoms of IBS without alarm signs and symptoms. Management of IBS is based on a multifactorial approach and includes establishment of an effective patient-provider relationship, education, reassurance, dietary alterations, pharmacotherapy, behavioral and psychological treatment. Patient-centered care is recommended, in which management is focused on the patient's most bothersome and impactful symptoms, their preferences and previous experiences with treatment, and addressing factors associated with the onset and exacerbation of symptoms. Pharmacotherapy is typically targeted against the predominant symptom. This Review discusses the current evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of IBS. An improved understanding of the recommended diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for IBS will lead to greater patient satisfaction, as well as reduced health-care costs.},

   abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota may play an important role in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms. However, an association between the composition of the intestinal microbiota and IBS symptoms has not been clearly demonstrated. In the current issue of the Journal, Tana et al. suggest that altered intestinal microbiota contributes to the symptoms of IBS through increased levels of organic acids. In fecal samples, IBS patients had significantly higher numbers of Veillonella and Lactobacillus than healthy controls. They also showed significantly higher levels of acetic acid and propionic acid. Furthermore, IBS patients with high acetic acid or propionic acid levels presented more severe symptoms, impaired quality of life and negative emotions. These results are in accordance with the concept that the gut microbiota influences the sensory, motor and immune system of the gut and interacts with higher brain centers. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth observed in a subset of IBS patients describes quantitative changes in the small intestinal microbiota. Data on qualitative changes in the gut microbiota in IBS patients are lacking. Different members of gut bacteria may have different influence on gut function. The concepts identified here may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for IBS using manipulation of the intestinal microbiota.},

We aimed to identify risk factors in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) without urinary tract infection or benign prostate hyperplasia in China. METHODS: A total of 397 outpatients with LUTS presenting for care to urology clinics in several hospitals throughout China were surveyed using a standardized questionnaire and validated outcome measures. The definitions for painful bladder syndrome based on the O'Leary-Sant interstitial cystitis symptom and problem indices were used. The prevalence of possible risk factors was analyzed using the Fisher's exact test and Pearson chi-square test, and multivariate predictive models were developed using binary Logistic regression methods. RESULTS: Of those multi-centre patients surveyed, including 174 women and 223 men, 41% (162/397) met criteria for painful bladder syndrome. There was a significant difference between women and men (55% (95/174) vs. 30% (67/223), P < 0.001). Women with IC/PBS were more likely than those without IC/PBS to report a history of gynecological infections (odds ratio (OR): 2.85; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.32 - 6.16, P = 0.007), intake of stimulatory foods (OR: 3.52; 95%CI: 1.50 - 8.30; P = 0.004), irritable bowel (OR: 3.46; 95%CI: 1.22 - 9.80; P = 0.014) and/or anorectal disease (OR: 2.68; 95%CI: 1.12 - 6.40, P = 0.023). After adjusting for confounding factors, bladder pain was significantly associated with stimulatory foods (OR: 3.85; 95%CI: 1.58 - 9.36, P = 0.003) and anorectal disease (OR: 2.76; 95%CI: 1.09 - 7.04, P = 0.03) in women. Caffeine beverage intake (OR: 3.54; 95%CI: 1.54 - 8.12, P = 0.003) was identified the only modifiable association noted in multivariate analysis of men. CONCLUSIONS: We found that stimulatory foods, anorectal disease and caffeine beverages are potential risk factors for IC/PBS. Further studies are necessary to determine their role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.},

Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum MF1298 was found to have the best in vitro probiotic properties of 22 strains of lactobacilli. The aim of this study was to investigate the symptomatic effect of L. plantarum MF1298 in subjects with IBS. Primary outcome was treatment preference and secondary outcomes were number of weeks with satisfactory relief of symptoms and IBS sum score. METHODS: The design was a randomised double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. 16 subjects with IBS underwent two three-week periods of daily intake of one capsule of 10(10) CFU L. plantarum MF 1298 or placebo separated by a four-week washout period. RESULTS: Thirteen participants (81%; 95% CI 57% to 93%; P = 0.012) preferred placebo to L. plantarum MF1298 treatment. The mean (SD) number of weeks with satisfactory relief of symptoms in the periods with L. plantarum MF1298 and placebo were 0.50 (0.89) and 1.44 (1.26), respectively (P = 0.006). IBS sum score was 6.44 (1.81) in the period with L. plantarum MF1298 treatment compared with 5.35 (1.77) in the period with placebo (P = 0.010). With a clinically significant difference in the IBS sum score of 2 in disfavour of active treatment, the number needed to harm was 3.7, 95% CI 2.3 to 10.9. CONCLUSIONS: This trial shows for the first time an unfavourable effect on symptoms in subjects with IBS after intake of a potential probiotic.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Self-reported food hypersensitivity (SFH) is common. Psychological factors are assumed to be associated. We assessed anxiety and depression in SFH patients, using both questionnaires and interview. METHODS: Consecutive patients (n=130) and randomly selected healthy volunteers (n=75) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the neuroticism scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-N) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Seventy-six of the patients were also interviewed by use of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the Montgomery-Aasberg Depression Rating Scale. All patients underwent extensive allergological, gastroenterological and dietary examinations. RESULTS: According to interviews, 57% of patients fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for at least one psychiatric disorder. Anxiety disorders (34%) and depression (16%) predominated. According to questionnaires, patients scored significantly higher than controls on all psychometric scales except for depression (HADS). We also found an underreporting of depression in HADS compared with interviews (2.5% vs. 16%, P=.001). Food hypersensitivity was rarely confirmed by provocation tests (8%). Eighty-nine percent of the patients had irritable bowel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety and depression are common in patients with IBS-like complaints self-attributed to food hypersensitivity. Anxiety disorders predominate. In this setting, depression may be underreported by HADS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An association between atopic disease and gastrointestinal complaints has been suggested. AIM: To explore the association between atopic disease, gastrointestinal symptoms, and possible gastrointestinal manifestations of atopic disease in patients with self-reported food hypersensitivity. METHODS: Symptoms, skin prick tests, serum markers of allergy and intestinal permeability were recorded in 71 adult patients. Eosinophils, tryptase- and IgE-positive cells were counted in duodenal biopsies. RESULTS: Sixty-six (93%) patients had irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 43 (61%) had atopic disease, predominantly rhinoconjunctivitis. All 43 were sensitized to inhalant allergens, 29 (41%) to food allergens, but food challenges were negative. Serum total IgE and duodenal IgE-positive cell counts were significantly correlated (P < 0.0001) and both were significantly higher in atopic than in non-atopic patients (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.003 respectively). IgE-positive cells appeared to be 'armed' mast cells. Intestinal permeability was significantly elevated in atopic compared with non-atopic patients (P = 0.02). Gastrointestinal symptoms and numbers of tryptase-positive mast cells and eosinophils did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with self-reported food hypersensitivity had a high prevalence of IBS and atopic disease. Atopic patients had increased intestinal permeability and density of IgE-bearing cells compared with non-atopic patients, but gastrointestinal symptoms did not differ between groups.},

   abstract = {Plants have contributed over the years to the discovery of various pharmacological products. Amongst the enormous diversity of herbs with remarkable medicinal use and further pharmacological potential, here in this report we evaluated pulp extracts from Eugenia dysenterica fruits and further identified the active principle involved in such laxative activity in rats. For protein isolation, fruits were macerated with an extraction solution following precipitation with (NH(4))(2)SO(4) (100%). After dialysis, the peptide was applied onto a reversed-phase semi-preparative HPLC column, and the major fraction was eluted with 26% and 66% acetonitrile. The evaluation of molecular masses by MALDI-TOF and Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE of HPLC fractions showed the presence of a major peptide with approximately 7 kDa. The N-terminal amino acid peptide sequence was determined and showed no similarity to other proteins deposited in the Data Bank. Peptide from E. dysenterica was able to enhance rats' intestinal motility by approximately 20.8%, probably being responsible for laxative activity. Moreover, these proteins were non-toxic to mammals, as observed in histopathology and hemolytic analyses. In conclusion, results here reported indicate that, in the near future, proteins synthesized by E. dysenterica fruits could be utilized in the development of novel biotechnological pharmaceutics with laxative properties for use in chronic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome treatment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined whether psychological factors such as general and gastrointestinal symptom-specific anxiety and depression could predict symptom severity in patients with unexplained, self-reported (subjective) food hypersensitivity. For the purpose, we translated and validated the Visceral Sensitivity Index (VSI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients completed questionnaires for Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, VSI, Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom Questionnaire, and Subjective Health Complaints Inventory. Relationship between scores on psychological factors and scores on somatic symptoms were studied by multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: Most patients reported non-gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to their irritable bowel syndrome complaints, but general and symptom-specific anxiety, and depression could not explain a significant amount of the variance in somatic complaints. Gastrointestinal symptom-specific anxiety was a significant predictor of gastrointestinal complaints (p = 0.02), and age was the sole significant predictor of non-gastrointestinal complaints (p = 0.01). Approximately 90% of the total variance in symptom severity remained unexplained by the psychological factors. The Norwegian version of the VSI had satisfactory validity (Cronbach alfa = 0.93). Symptom-specific and general anxiety were significantly correlated (r = 0.48, p < or = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological factors were not major predictors of symptom severity in patients with subjective food hypersensitivity. The Norwegian version of VSI had satisfactory validity.},

   abstract = {Beta2-1 fructans are carbohydrate molecules with prebiotic properties. Through resistance to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract, they reach the colon intact, where they selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial members of the gut microbiota. Through this modification of the intestinal microbiota, and by additional mechanisms, beta2-1 fructans may have beneficial effects upon immune function, ability to combat infection, and inflammatory processes and conditions. In this paper, we have collated, summarised and evaluated studies investigating these areas. Twenty-one studies in laboratory animals suggest that some aspects of innate and adaptive immunity of the gut and the systemic immune systems are modified by beta2-1 fructans. In man, two studies in children and nine studies in adults indicate that the adaptive immune system may be modified by beta2-1 fructans. Thirteen studies in animal models of intestinal infections conclude a beneficial effect of beta2-1 fructans. Ten trials involving infants and children have mostly reported benefits on infectious outcomes; in fifteen adult trials, little effect was generally seen, although in specific situations, certain beta2-1 fructans may be beneficial. Ten studies in animal models show benefit of beta2-1 fructans with regard to intestinal inflammation. Human studies report some benefits regarding inflammatory bowel disease (four positive studies) and atopic dermatitis (one positive study), but findings in irritable bowel syndrome are inconsistent. Therefore, overall the results indicate that beta2-1 fructans are able to modulate some aspects of immune function, to improve the host's ability to respond successfully to certain intestinal infections, and to modify some inflammatory conditions.},

   abstract = {A number of studies have been performed examining the influence of various probiotic organisms, either alone or in combination, on immune parameters, infectious outcomes, and inflammatory conditions in humans. Some components of the immune response, including phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity and mucosal immunoglobulin A production (especially in children), can be improved by some probiotic bacteria. Other components, including lymphocyte proliferation, the production of cytokines and of antibodies other than immunoglobulin A appear less sensitive to probiotics. Probiotics, including lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, administered to children can reduce incidence and duration of diarrhoea, but the precise effects depend upon the nature of the condition. Probiotic supplementation can reduce the risk of travellers' diarrhoea in adults, but does not affect duration. The effect of probiotics on other infectious outcomes is less clear. Probiotics may benefit children and adults with irritable bowel syndrome and adults with ulcerative colitis; studies in Crohn's Disease are less clear. Probiotics have little effect in rheumatoid arthritis. Probiotic supplementation, especially with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, can reduce risk and severity of allergic disease, particular atopic dermatitis; early supplementation appears to be effective. Overall, the picture that emerges from studies of probiotics on immune, infectious and inflammatory outcomes in humans is mixed and there appear to be large species and strain differences in effects seen. Other reasons for differences in effects seen will include dose of probiotic organism used, duration of supplementation, characteristics of the subjects studied, sample size, and technical differences in how the measurements were made.},

However, recent studies have suggested that probiotics could have beneficial effects beyond gastrointestinal health, as they were found to improve certain metabolic disorders such as hypertension. Hypertension is caused by various factors and the predominant causes include an increase in cholesterol levels, incidence of diabetes, inconsistent modulation of renin and imbalanced sexual hormones. This review discusses the antihypertensive roles of probiotics via the improvement and/or treatment of lipid profiles, modulation of insulin resistance and sensitivity, the modulation of renin levels and also the conversion of bioactive phytoestrogens as an alternative replacement of sexual hormones such as estrogen and progesterone.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Probiotics can alleviate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), possibly by stabilizing the intestinal microbiota. Our aim was to determine whether IBS-associated bacterial alterations were reduced during multispecies probiotic intervention consisting of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS and Bifidobacterium breve Bb99. The intervention has previously been shown to successfully alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms of IBS. METHODS: The faecal microbiotas of 42 IBS subjects participating in a placebo-controlled double-blind multispecies probiotic intervention were analysed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Eight bacterial targets within the gastrointestinal microbiota with a putative IBS association were measured. RESULTS: A phylotype with 94% similarity to Ruminococcus torques remained abundant in the placebo group, but was decreased in the probiotic group during the intervention (P = 0.02 at 6 months). In addition, the clostridial phylotype, Clostridium thermosuccinogenes 85%, was stably elevated during the intervention (P = 0.00 and P = 0.02 at 3 and 6 months, respectively). The bacterial alterations detected were in accordance with previously discovered alleviation of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic supplement was thus shown to exert specific alterations in the IBS-associated microbiota towards the bacterial 16S rDNA phylotype quantities described previously for subjects free of IBS. These changes may have value as non-invasive biomarkers in probiotic intervention studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental risk factors playing a causative role in Crohn's Disease (CD) remain largely unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that refrigerated food could be involved in disease development. We thus conducted a pilot case control study to explore the association of CD with the exposure to domestic refrigeration in childhood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a standard questionnaire we interviewed 199 CD cases and 207 age-matched patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as controls. Cases and controls were followed by the same gastroenterologists of tertiary referral clinics in Tehran, Iran. The questionnaire focused on the date of the first acquisition of home refrigerator and freezer. Data were analysed by a multivariate logistic model. The current age was in average 34 years in CD cases and the percentage of females in the case and control groups were respectively 48.3% and 63.7%. Patients were exposed earlier than controls to the refrigerator (X2 = 9.9, df = 3, P = 0.04) and refrigerator exposure at birth was found to be a risk factor for CD (OR = 2.08 (95% CI: 1.01-4.29), P = 0.05). Comparable results were obtained looking for the exposure to freezer at home. Finally, among the other recorded items reflecting the hygiene and comfort at home, we also found personal television, car and washing machine associated with CD. CONCLUSION: This study supports the opinion that CD is associated with exposure to domestic refrigeration, among other household factors, during childhood.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Postprandial symptoms are common in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and could be diet related. We studied postprandial changes in distribution of water in the upper gastrointestinal tract of healthy volunteers (HVs) and patients with IBS-D after contrasting meals. METHODS: In study 1, 11 HVs consumed 350-mL test meals with 5% mannitol (unabsorbable) or 5% glucose (readily absorbed). In study 2, 17 HVs consumed a 331-kcal meal, with or without 15 g bran. In study 3, 26 patients with IBS-D consumed the study 2 diet with bran meal. All subjects underwent serial magnetic resonance imaging analysis. RESULTS: In study 1, subjects' small bowel water content (SBWC) increased after the mannitol but not glucose meals, reaching 381 mL (interquartile range, 343-491 mL) and 47 mL (18-78 mL), respectively, 40 minutes after eating (P < .001). In study 2, SBWC initially decreased after both meal types and then increased, plateauing at 180-405 minutes and was greater after the bran meal (P = .02). In study 3, fasting and postprandial SBWC was lower in IBS-D than in HVs (P < .05 and P < .0001, respectively). Patients with IBS-D had faster orocecal transit times (135 minutes; 90-180 minutes) compared with HVs (225 minutes; 203-293 minutes; P < .0001) and reduced terminal ileum diameter (P < .003). CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial SBWC initially decreases, because of rapid, nutrient-driven fluid absorption, and then increases after a mixed liquid/solid meal. Patients with IBS-D have reduced fasting and postprandial SBWC with faster transit, possibly indicating increased small intestinal tone.},

   abstract = {Clinicians have long learned of the pathogenic microorganisms that cause intestinal infections and that can be identified by culture methods from fecal, mucosa and blood samples. Nevertheless, much progress has been made due, in large part, to molecular biology which has enabled the discovery of pathogens that are not (yet) able to be cultured, but also to the protective role of some microorganisms within the microbiota. Ecological and clinical disturbances related to antibiotic therapy were decisive for demonstrating the beneficial effects of the endogenous microbiota and establishing the beneficial effects of biotherapeutic agents, known as probiotics. Most areas of gastroenterology (cryptogenic inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, lymphomas, etc.), but also those in medicine overall (obesity for example), are affected by this new approach and are showing very significant progress. This article summarizes the historical steps of these discoveries and reviews what the "modern" clinician should know in this very dynamic area in regard to research and practical consequences.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Treatment of functional bowel disorders of irritable bowel-type (IBS) in children remains a difficult task because of a lack of drugs with low adverse event profile. We here report the results of a treatment study in 203 children (66 boys and 137 girls) age 4 to 18 years (mean: 10.5+/-4.5 years) with typical IBS symptoms with abdominal pain and either predominant diarrhea (n=50), constipation (n=56), alternating stool frequency (n=28) or unspecific pain (n=69). The average duration of symptoms prior to therapy was 175 days. Most (95%) patients up to age 11 were treated with a daily dose of 10 drops of Symbioflor 2 (SF2) (SymbioPharm, Herborn) (cells and autolysate of 1.5-4.5x10(7) CFU of bacteria of Escherichia coli type), in the elder children 77% received this dosage, while the remaining received a higher dose up to 30 drops/day. Treatment lasted 43 days on average. RESULTS: All patients tolerated the treatment well and without adverse events. The key IBS symptoms (abdominal pain, stool frequency) as well as the other symptoms (bloating, mucous and blood in stool, need for straining at stools, urge to defecate) improved significantly during treatment. Global assessment of therapy by parents and doctors was altogether positive. In summary these data confirm efficacy and tolerability of this probiotic compound in children and adolescents and supplement published data of probiotic IBS therapy in adults.},

For meta-analysis, only randomized, blinded controlled trials unrestricted by language were included. Pre-clinical studies, volunteer studies and uncontrolled studies were excluded from the review of efficacy and meta-analysis, but included in the systematic review. Of 31 randomized, placebo-controlled treatment arms in 27 trials (encompassing 5029 study patients), S. boulardii was found to be significantly efficacious and safe in 84% of those treatment arms. A meta-analysis found a significant therapeutic efficacy for S. boulardii in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) (RR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.35-0.63, P < 0.001). In adults, S. boulardii can be strongly recommended for the prevention of AAD and the traveler's diarrhea. Randomized trials also support the use of this yeast probiotic for prevention of enteral nutrition-related diarrhea and reduction of Helicobacter pylori treatment-related symptoms. S. boulardii shows promise for the prevention of C. difficile disease recurrences; treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, acute adult diarrhea, Crohn's disease, giardiasis, human immunodeficiency virus-related diarrhea; but more supporting evidence is recommended for these indications. The use of S. boulardii as a therapeutic probiotic is evidence-based for both efficacy and safety for several types of diarrhea.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and altering bowel habit with a high percentage of patients displaying comorbid anxiety. Growing clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that probiotic agents may restore the altered brain-gut communication in IBS. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of repeated treatment with three different probiotics in reducing visceral pain in visceral normosensitive (Sprague-Dawley [SD]) and visceral hypersensitive (Wistar-Kyoto [WKY]) rat strains. METHODS: Following 14 days oral gavage of Lactobacillus salivarius UCC118, Bifidobacterium infantis 35624, or Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 both SD and WKY rats were exposed to a novel stress, the open field arena and their behavior was recorded. Subsequently, the effects of probiotics on visceral nociceptive responses were analyzed by recording pain behaviors during colorectal distension (CRD). KEY RESULTS: It was found that there was a difference in the open field behavior between strains but none of the probiotic treatment altered behavior within each strain. Interestingly, the probiotic B. infantis 35624 but not others tested significantly reduced CRD-induced visceral pain behaviors in both rat strains. It significantly increased the threshold pressure of the first pain behavior and also reduced the total number pain behaviors during CRD. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: These data confirm that probiotics such as B. infantis 35624 are effective in reducing visceral pain and may be effective in treating certain symptoms of IBS.},

   abstract = {Fibromyalgia and associated conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and temporomandibular disorder involve dysfunctions in central sensitization and pain modulation. Central nervous system dysfunction may also contribute to other symptoms characteristic of fibromyalgia, such as fatigue and sleep disturbance. Two key neurotransmitters in the pain modulation pathway are serotonin and norepinephrine. Preclinical studies using animal models of chronic pain have shown that pharmacologic agents that combine serotonergic and noradrenergic reuptake inhibition, thus augmenting the function of these neurotransmitters, have stronger analgesic effects than agents that inhibit reuptake of either neurotransmitter alone. Although tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) inhibit reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine and have shown efficacy for the treatment of fibromyalgia, long-term use of these drugs is limited owing to poor tolerability. Unlike TCAs, the newer dual reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine, such as the drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for fibromyalgia, milnacipran and duloxetine, do not possess significant affinity for other neurotransmitter systems, resulting in diminished side effects and enhanced tolerability. Both duloxetine and milnacipran have shown efficacy in clinical trials by improving pain and other symptoms associated with fibromyalgia. Both compounds inhibit the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters; however, there is a difference in their affinities and selectivity for these transporters. Although duloxetine has affinity for both receptors, it is somewhat more selective for the serotonin transporter. In contrast, milnacipran is somewhat more selective for norepinephrine than serotonin reuptake inhibition. Pharmacologic agents that specifically target serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake may prove to be valuable tools in the treatment of fibromyalgia.},

METHODS: We conducted a survey at 9 different sites in our metro area. Subjects filled a questionnaire which included Rome II criteria for IBS. Subjects were asked about demographic and clinical characteristics. Subjects with a prior history of chronic inflammatory bowel disease and gastrointestinal cancer were excluded. RESULTS: Nine hundred and ninety subjects (670 African-Americans and 320 Caucasians) were included in the final analysis. IBS patients had more food allergies and were more likely perceived to have poor health as well as physical limitations. A reduced logistic regression model demonstrated that travel abroad, upper respiratory infections, tonsillectomy, and loss of appetite were independently associated with race in the IBS patients. There were no racial differences in physical or sexual abuse, loss of interest in life, or suicidal thoughts. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial similarities as well as differences in IBS patients of the two races support the concept that, while there is an important role for a biological component to the pathogenesis of IBS, it by itself may not be an exclusive determinant.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Probiotics may benefit irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, but randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conflicting; therefore a systematic review was conducted. METHODS: MEDLINE (1966 to May 2008), EMBASE (1988 to May 2008) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2008) electronic databases were searched, as were abstracts from DDW (Digestive Diseases Week) and UEGW (United European Gastroenterology Week), and authors were contacted for extra information. Only parallel group RCTs with at least 1 week of treatment comparing probiotics with placebo or no treatment in adults with IBS according to any acceptable definition were included. Studies had to provide improvement in abdominal pain or global IBS symptoms as an outcome. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. Data were synthesised using relative risk (RR) of symptoms not improving for dichotomous data and standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data using random effects models. RESULTS: 19 RCTs (18 papers) in 1650 patients with IBS were identified. Trial quality was generally good, with nine reporting adequate methods of randomisation and six a method of concealment of allocation. There were 10 RCTs involving 918 patients providing outcomes as a dichotomous variable. Probiotics were statistically significantly better than placebo (RR of IBS not improving=0.71; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88) with a number needed to treat (NNT)=4 (95% CI 3 to 12.5). There was significant heterogeneity (chi(2)=28.3, p=0.001, I(2)=68%) and possible funnel plot asymmetry. Fifteen trials assessing 1351 patients reported on improvement in IBS score as a continuous outcome (SMD=-0.34; 95% CI -0.60 to -0.07). There was statistically significant heterogeneity (chi(2)=67.04, p<0.001, I(2)=79%), but this was explained by one outlying trial. CONCLUSION: Probiotics appear to be efficacious in IBS, but the magnitude of benefit and the most effective species and strain are uncertain.},

DESIGN: An intention to treat, double blind, randomised, crossover trial comparing PEZ to placebo for reduction of postprandial IBS-D. Patients had to recognise at least two different triggering foods, be willing to consume six baseline 'trigger meals' and again blinded with PEZ and placebo. Patients then chose which drug they preferred for another 25 meals. SETTING: Outpatient internal medicine practice clinic. PATIENTS: 255 patients were screened; 83 met the criteria, including 5 years of symptoms, recognised 'food triggers', no other identifiable cause for the symptoms, either a normal colonoscopy or barium enema while symptomatic and able to discontinue all anticholinergic medications. 69 patients were enrolled, 20 withdrew before randomisation, leaving 49 patients: 14 men, 35 women, mean age 52 years (SD 15.3). Over 60% had experienced symptoms for 11-30 years and 16% for more than 40 years. INTERVENTIONS: After completing six baseline meals, patients were randomised in blocks of four to receive either identical PEZ or a placebo for another six meals, and after a washout period of time received the alternative drug. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary analysis was number of patients who chose PEZ over placebo for the extended use. RESULTS: Overall, 30/49 (61%) would have chosen PEZ (p=0.078), with first drug preference for PEZ at 0.002. Among the PEZ subgroup, PEZ use compared with placebo, demonstrated improvement in all symptoms (p</=0.001) for cramping, bloating, borborygami, urge to defecate, global pain and decrease stooling with increase in stool firmness. CONCLUSIONS: PEZ was found in a small group of patients to reduce postprandial IBS-D symptoms and deserves further evaluation.},

   abstract = {Patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) commonly report the precipitation of symptoms on food ingestion. Though the role of dietary constituents in IBS has not been extensively studied, food could contribute to symptom onset or even the causation of IBS through a number of mechanisms. First, the physiological response of the intestine to food ingestion could precipitate symptoms in predisposed individuals; second, there is some evidence that allergy or intolerance to a particular food can produce IBS-like symptoms, third, certain foods may alter the composition of the luminal milieu, either directly or indirectly through effects on bacterial metabolism, and thus induce symptoms and, finally, IBS may develop following exposure to food-borne pathogens. Anticipatory, psychological factors generated by previous negative experiences with food ingestion or other factors may also contribute though their contribution has been scarcely quantified. Not surprisingly, there is considerable interest in the potential roles of diet and food supplements in the therapy of IBS; for the most part, the evidence base for such recommendations remains slim though certain probiotics show considerable promise.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE. Intestinal infection with Giardia lamblia may lead to therapy-resistant, long-lasting post-giardiasis irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We report two open pilot studies aiming to treat this condition, using either antibiotics or bacterio-therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Twenty-eight patients with persistent abdominal symptoms, following clearance of G. lamblia infection, were investigated. Eighteen received treatment with rifaximin plus metronidazole (8-10 days) whereas 10 received a suspension of live faecal flora, installed into the duodenum during gastro-duodenoscopy. Customary abdominal symptoms and symptoms following a lactulose breath test were quantified by questionnaires. Hydrogen and methane production after lactulose were analysed in expired air and excretion of fat and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was examined in faeces. RESULTS. As compared with pre-treatment values, total customary symptom scores were barely significantly reduced (p = 0.07) after antibiotics, but were highly significantly reduced (p = 0.0009) after bacterio-therapy. However, symptom improvement following bacterio-therapy did not persist 1 year later. Hydrogen breath excretion was slightly reduced after antibiotics, but not after bacterio-therapy. Compared with healthy persons, faecal excretion of fat was significantly increased in Giardia-cured patients. SCFAs were increased in the bacterio-therapy group, and were not influenced by therapy. CONCLUSIONS. Both antibiotics and bacterio-therapy were ineffective with respect to cure of post-giardiasis IBS. High faecal excretion of fat and SCFAs suggests that intestinal malabsorption of fat and carbohydrates may play a role in the IBS-like complaints of these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest a link between gut microbiota and the development of ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Our aim was to investigate any quantitative differences in faecal bacterial compositions in UC and IBS patients compared to healthy controls, and to identify individual bacterial species that contribute to these differences. METHODS: Faecal microbiota of 13 UC patients, 11 IBS patients and 22 healthy volunteers were analysed by PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) using universal and Bacteroides specific primers. The data obtained were normalized using in-house developed statistical method and interrogated by multivariate approaches. The differentiated bands were excised and identified by sequencing the V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes. RESULTS: Band profiles revealed that number of predominant faecal bacteria were significantly different between UC, IBS and control group (p < 10-4). By assessing the mean band numbers in UC (37 +/- 5) and IBS (39 +/- 6), compared to the controls (45 +/- 3), a significant decrease in bacterial species is suggested (p = 0.01). There were no significant differences between IBS and UC. Biodiversity of the bacterial species was significantly lower in UC (mu = 2.94, sigma = 0.29) and IBS patients (mu = 2.90, sigma = 0.38) than controls (mu = 3.25, sigma = 0.16; p = 0.01). Moreover, similarity indices revealed greater biological variability of predominant bacteria in UC and IBS compared to the controls (median Dice coefficients 76.1% (IQR 70.9 - 83.1), 73.8% (IQR 67.0 - 77.5) and 82.9% (IQR 79.1 - 86.7) respectively). DNA sequencing of discriminating bands suggest that the presence of Bacteroides vulgatus, B. ovatus, B. uniformis, and Parabacteroides sp. in healthy volunteers distinguishes them from IBS and UC patients. DGGE profiles of Bacteroides species revealed a decrease of Bacteroides community in UC relative to IBS and controls. CONCLUSION: Molecular profiling of faecal bacteria revealed abnormalities of intestinal microbiota in UC and IBS patients, while different patterns of Bacteroides species loss in particular, were associated with UC and IBS.},

   abstract = {The intestinal tract is a diverse microenvironment where more than 500 species of bacteria thrive. A single layer of epithelium is all that separates these commensal microorganisms and pathogens from the underlying immune cells, and thus epithelial barrier function is a key component in the arsenal of defense mechanisms required to prevent infection and inflammation. The epithelial barrier consists of a dense mucous layer containing secretory IgA and antimicrobial peptides as well as dynamic junctional complexes that regulate permeability between cells. Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer benefit to the host and that have been suggested to ameliorate or prevent diseases including antibiotic-associated diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. Probiotics likely function through enhancement of barrier function, immunomodulation, and competitive adherence to the mucus and epithelium. This review summarizes the evidence about effects of the many available probiotics with an emphasis on intestinal barrier function and the mechanisms affected by probiotics.},

   abstract = {Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may have a low grade immune activation. However, little is known about the properties of B cells of IBS patients. We therefore investigated activation level and antigen presenting phenotype of blood B cells of IBS patients. We also examined B-cell responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and probiotic bacteria. Blood samples were obtained from 74 IBS patients and 30 healthy subjects. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and stimulated with LPS or an UV-light inactivated bacterial cocktail consisting of the probiotic Gram-positive strains; Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei 19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium lactis B612. The phenotype of CD19(+) B cells was investigated by flow cytometry before and after 72 h cell culture. Furthermore, IBS symptom severity was assessed. B cells isolated from blood of IBS patients displayed an amplified activation level as demonstrated by increased cell surface expression of IgG, and also the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86. Expression of antigen presenting HLA-DR and costimulatory molecule CD40 on B cells was, however comparable in IBS patients and controls. B cells of IBS patients displayed an impaired ability to increase expression of CD80, but not CD86, in response to both LPS as well as probiotic bacteria stimulations. To conclude, blood B cells of IBS patients have an increased activation level. Bacterial component induced expression of the costimulatory molecule CD80, regarded as important for tolerance induction, is impaired. These data suggest that B-cell antigen presentation in IBS patients is associated with altered capacity of providing costimulation to T cells.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Reduction of short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates (FODMAPs) in the diet reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In the present study, we aimed to compare the patterns of breath hydrogen and methane and symptoms produced in response to diets that differed only in FODMAP content. METHODS: Fifteen healthy subjects and 15 with IBS (Rome III criteria) undertook a single-blind, crossover intervention trial involving consuming provided diets that were either low (9 g/day) or high (50 g/day) in FODMAPs for 2 days. Food and gastrointestinal symptom diaries were kept and breath samples collected hourly over 14 h on day 2 of each diet. RESULTS: Higher levels of breath hydrogen were produced over the entire day with the high FODMAP diet for healthy volunteers (181 +/- 77 ppm.14 h vs 43 +/- 18; mean +/- SD P < 0.0001) and patients with IBS (242 +/- 79 vs 62 +/- 23; P < 0.0001), who had higher levels during each dietary period than the controls (P < 0.05). Breath methane, produced by 10 subjects within each group, was reduced with the high FODMAP intake in healthy subjects (47 +/- 29 vs 109 +/- 77; P = 0.043), but was not different in patients with IBS (126 +/- 153 vs 86 +/- 72). Gastrointestinal symptoms and lethargy were significantly induced by the high FODMAP diet in patients with IBS, while only increased flatus production was reported by healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary FODMAPs induce prolonged hydrogen production in the intestine that is greater in IBS, influence the amount of methane produced, and induce gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms experienced by patients with IBS. The results offer mechanisms underlying the efficacy of the low FODMAP diet in IBS.},

Measures include the Modified Flanagan Quality of Life Scale and a 3-day food record ( n = 95) and a daily symptom diary completed over a month. There are no differences in QOL and few differences in dietary intake, although women with the most severe bloating report less dietary intake of fructose ( p = .035) as compared with the women with less severe bloating symptoms. The findings suggest that women with IBS who experience moderate to severe bloating symptoms may not reduce their dietary intake except fructose.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of chronic abdominal pain, altered bowel habit and abdominal distension. It is the commonest cause of referral to gastroenterologists in the developed world and yet current therapeutic strategies are often unsatisfactory. There is now increasing evidence linking alterations in the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota and IBS. Changes in faecal and mucosa-associated microbiota, post-infectious IBS, a link with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and an up-regulation of the GI mucosal immune system all suggest a role for the GI microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS. Given this evidence, therapeutic alteration of the GI microbiota by probiotic bacteria could be beneficial. The present paper establishes an aetiological framework for the use of probiotics in IBS and comprehensively reviews randomised placebo-controlled trials of probiotics in IBS using multiple electronic databases. It highlights safety concerns over the use of probiotics and attempts to establish guidelines for their use in IBS in both primary and secondary care.},

For eight weeks, IBS patients consumed 0.4 L per day of a probiotic fermented milk product or non-probiotic acidified milk. Both diets resulted in elevated levels of blood serum L-lactate and 3-hydroxybutyrate. Our results showed identical effects of acidified milk consumption independent of probiotic addition. A similar result was previously obtained in a questionnaire-based evaluation of symptom relief.

However, there was no correspondence between symptom relief and metabolite response on the patient level.},

   abstract = {Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptors family. Currently five different receptor subtypes have been identified and cloned. M3 receptor subtypes are coupled to G(q) family proteins and increase phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis and calcium release from internal stores. They are widely distributed both in the central nervous system and in the periphery. At the central level, M3 receptor subtypes are involved in modulation of neurotransmitter release, temperature homeostasis, and food intake, while in the periphery they induce smooth muscle contraction, gland secretion, indirect relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, and miosis. The main therapeutic applications of M3 antagonists include overactive bladder (OAB), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pain-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The introduction of selective M3 antagonists has not improved clinical efficacy compared with the old non-selective antimuscarinics but has reduced the rate of adverse events mediated by the blockade of cardiac M2 receptors (tachycardia) and central M1 receptors (cognitive impairment). Improved tolerability has been obtained also with controlled release or with inhaled formulations. However, there is still a need for safer M3 antagonists for the treatment of COPD and better-tolerated and more effective compounds for the therapy of OAB. New selective muscarinic M3 antagonists currently in early discovery and under development have been designed to address these issues. However, as M3 receptors are widely located in various tissues including salivary glands, gut smooth muscles, iris, and ciliary muscles, further clinical improvements may derive from the discovery and the development of new compounds with tissue rather than muscarinic receptor subtype selectivity.},

Recent investigations suggest that alterations of the intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, in particular increased permeability, could modify the cross-talk between bacterial microflora and the host, thus leading to persitent "low-grade" inflammation and alterated GI motility and sensitivity.},

People's experience of IBS can fluctuate over time and various bowel symptoms may predominate. Many complementary medicines are used to treat IBS symptoms. Currently there is good evidence to recommend the use of probiotics, peppermint oil capsules and psyllium. Other therapies such as Chinese and Ayuvedic herbs and psychological techniques look promising, but further high quality trials are required before these approaches can be recommended.},

   abstract = {Studies of metagenomics and the human microbiome will tremendously expand our knowledge of the composition of microbial communities in the human body. As our understanding of microbial variation and corresponding genetic parameters is refined, this information can be applied to rational remodeling or "tailoring" of human-associated microbial communities and their associated functions. Physiologic features such as the development of innate and adaptive immunity, relative susceptibilities to infections, immune tolerance, bioavailability of nutrients, and intestinal barrier function may be modified by changing the composition and functions of the microbial communities. The specialty of gastroenterology will be affected profoundly by the ability to modify the gastrointestinal microbiota through the rational deployment of antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics. Antibiotics might be used to remove or suppress undesirable components of the human microbiome. Probiotics can introduce missing microbial components with known beneficial functions for the human host. Prebiotics can enhance the proliferation of beneficial microbes or probiotics, to maximize sustainable changes in the human microbiome. Combinations of these approaches might provide synergistic and effective therapies for specific disorders. The human microbiome could be manipulated by such "smart" strategies to prevent and treat acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, and a variety of other disorders.},

   abstract = {There is resurgent interest in the use of probiotics to maintain gastrointestinal and systemic health, driven by recent advances in knowledge of bacterial interactions with the epithelium and innate immune system of the intestine. The effects of probiotic bacteria on the intestinal epithelium and their downstream consequences are reviewed. Probiotics prevent pathogen adherence and invasion of the epithelium, partly by blocking adherence sites but also by upregulating gene expression of MUC2 and of antimicrobial peptides. Metabolic effects of probiotics on the intestinal epithelium include production of short chain fatty acids which influence epithelial cell metabolism, turnover and apoptosis. Bacterial metabolism of unabsorbed dietary constituents with production of free radicals and phenolic metabolites can lead to DNA damage and cancer; probiotics restore eubiosis and potentially prevent this. Probiotics alter expression and redistribution of tight junction proteins and reduce intestinal permeability limiting absorption of noxious molecules from the gut lumen. Most studied are the effects of probiotics on epithelial cells which are the first line of innate immune-capable cells that encounter luminal flora. Probiotics, through secreted molecules, influence the innate inflammatory response of epithelial cells to stimuli from the gut lumen, and reduce mucosal inflammation. Through effects on dendritic, and possibly epithelial, cells they influence naive T cells in the lamina propria of the gut and thus influence adaptive immunity. These varied effects of probiotics have implications for the treatment of several gastrointestinal diseases including antibiotic-associated colitis, acute gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, and irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {Increased intestinal permeability is a likely cause of various pathologies, such as allergies and metabolic or even cardiovascular disturbances. Intestinal permeability is found in many severe clinical situations and in common disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. In these conditions, substances that are normally unable to cross the epithelial barrier gain access to the systemic circulation. To illustrate the potential harmfulness of leaky gut, we present an argument based on examples linked to protein or lipid glycation induced by modern food processing. Increased intestinal permeability should be largely improved by dietary addition of compounds, such as glutamine or curcumin, which both have the mechanistic potential to inhibit the inflammation and oxidative stress linked to tight junction opening. This brief review aims to increase physician awareness of this common, albeit largely unrecognized, pathology, which may be easily prevented or improved by means of simple nutritional changes.},

AIM: To review the drugs recommended in IBS, their mechanisms of action, side effects, risks and benefits, contraindications, availability in our country and the evidence supporting their use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A technical and narrative review which evaluated the articles published in national and world literature regarding the pharmacological treatment of IBS was performed. PubMed and IMBIOMED electronic databases were searched (until September 2009) using all descriptors regarding IBS and drug therapy. RESULTS: There is enough clinical evidence to recommend the use of antispasmodics (alone orin combination) and tricyclic antidepressants for pain treatment in IBS. Laxatives are useful in the management of chronic constipation, but there is little evidence in the management of IBS. Although, antiflatulents and antidiarrheals are widely used there is little information supporting its use. The use of a nonabsorbable antibiotic (rifaximin) is effective in a subgroup of IBS patients. Serotoninergics drugs have proven effective in relieving symptoms of IBS; however, these drugs require caution in their use. There are studies have shown that probiotics improve some symptoms of IBS. CONCLUSIONS: There are many effective treatment options in the symptomatic management of IBS. The choice of treatment should be based on the predominant symptoms of each patient.},

However, the underlying mechanisms of IBS are poorly understood, and there are few data available about the epidemiology of this syndrome or the impact of its symptoms. We investigated the prevalence, characteristics, and impact of bloating symptoms in patients with IBS. METHODS: IBS patients were identified by Rome II criteria in a U.S. population representative web-based survey. Patients were asked about the quality, frequency, and severity of their gastrointestinal symptoms. The impact of these symptoms was investigated by assessing patients' health-related quality of life, utilization of health care, and use of medications. RESULTS: Of the 337 IBS patients in this study, 82.5% (n = 278) reported bloating symptoms, the second most bothersome symptom after abdominal cramping. The symptoms were more prevalent in female patients, 87.4% (n = 209), than in male patients, 70.4% (n = 69) (P < .0001), and in patients with constipation, 88.7% (n = 47), and mixed symptoms, 88.8% (n = 135), than in patients with diarrhea, 72.3% (n = 96), (P = .02 and P < .01, respectively). Bloating symptoms were the third (of 14) most important reason to seek medical care, and more than half of the patients reported regular use of anti-gas medications. Bloating symptoms were associated with decreased energy levels (P = .04), food intake (P < .01), and physical functioning (P = .06). CONCLUSIONS: Bloating symptoms are common in patients with IBS, and their prevalence and relative severity differ on the basis of sex and IBS subtype. Bloating symptoms are associated with a decrease in the quality of life and increases in health care utilization and use of medications.},

   abstract = {The different compartments of the gastrointestinal tract are inhabited by populations of micro-organisms. By far the most important predominant populations are in the colon where a true symbiosis with the host exists that is a key for well-being and health. For such a microbiota, 'normobiosis' characterises a composition of the gut 'ecosystem' in which micro-organisms with potential health benefits predominate in number over potentially harmful ones, in contrast to 'dysbiosis', in which one or a few potentially harmful micro-organisms are dominant, thus creating a disease-prone situation. The present document has been written by a group of both academic and industry experts (in the ILSI Europe Prebiotic Expert Group and Prebiotic Task Force, respectively). It does not aim to propose a new definition of a prebiotic nor to identify which food products are classified as prebiotic but rather to validate and expand the original idea of the prebiotic concept (that can be translated in 'prebiotic effects'), defined as: 'The selective stimulation of growth and/or activity(ies) of one or a limited number of microbial genus(era)/species in the gut microbiota that confer(s) health benefits to the host.' Thanks to the methodological and fundamental research of microbiologists, immense progress has very recently been made in our understanding of the gut microbiota. A large number of human intervention studies have been performed that have demonstrated that dietary consumption of certain food products can result in statistically significant changes in the composition of the gut microbiota in line with the prebiotic concept. Thus the prebiotic effect is now a well-established scientific fact. The more data are accumulating, the more it will be recognised that such changes in the microbiota's composition, especially increase in bifidobacteria, can be regarded as a marker of intestinal health. The review is divided in chapters that cover the major areas of nutrition research where a prebiotic effect has tentatively been investigated for potential health benefits. The prebiotic effect has been shown to associate with modulation of biomarkers and activity(ies) of the immune system. Confirming the studies in adults, it has been demonstrated that, in infant nutrition, the prebiotic effect includes a significant change of gut microbiota composition, especially an increase of faecal concentrations of bifidobacteria. This concomitantly improves stool quality (pH, SCFA, frequency and consistency), reduces the risk of gastroenteritis and infections, improves general well-being and reduces the incidence of allergic symptoms such as atopic eczema. Changes in the gut microbiota composition are classically considered as one of the many factors involved in the pathogenesis of either inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. The use of particular food products with a prebiotic effect has thus been tested in clinical trials with the objective to improve the clinical activity and well-being of patients with such disorders. Promising beneficial effects have been demonstrated in some preliminary studies, including changes in gut microbiota composition (especially increase in bifidobacteria concentration). Often associated with toxic load and/or miscellaneous risk factors, colon cancer is another pathology for which a possible role of gut microbiota composition has been hypothesised. Numerous experimental studies have reported reduction in incidence of tumours and cancers after feeding specific food products with a prebiotic effect. Some of these studies (including one human trial) have also reported that, in such conditions, gut microbiota composition was modified (especially due to increased concentration of bifidobacteria). Dietary intake of particular food products with a prebiotic effect has been shown, especially in adolescents, but also tentatively in postmenopausal women, to increase Ca absorption as well as bone Ca accretion and bone mineral density. Recent data, both from experimental models and from human studies, support the beneficial effects of particular food products with prebiotic properties on energy homaeostasis, satiety regulation and body weight gain. Together, with data in obese animals and patients, these studies support the hypothesis that gut microbiota composition (especially the number of bifidobacteria) may contribute to modulate metabolic processes associated with syndrome X, especially obesity and diabetes type 2. It is plausible, even though not exclusive, that these effects are linked to the microbiota-induced changes and it is feasible to conclude that their mechanisms fit into the prebiotic effect. However, the role of such changes in these health benefits remains to be definitively proven. As a result of the research activity that followed the publication of the prebiotic concept 15 years ago, it has become clear that products that cause a selective modification in the gut microbiota's composition and/or activity(ies) and thus strengthens normobiosis could either induce beneficial physiological effects in the colon and also in extra-intestinal compartments or contribute towards reducing the risk of dysbiosis and associated intestinal and systemic pathologies.},

There was general agreement that probiotic effects were species and often strain specific. The experts agreed that some probiotics were effective in reducing the incidence and duration of rotavirus diarrhoea in infants, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in adults and, for certain probiotics, Clostridium difficile infections. Some probiotics are associated with symptomatic improvements in irritable bowel syndrome and alleviation of digestive discomfort. Probiotics can reduce the frequency and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants and have been shown to regulate intestinal immunity. Several other clinical effects of probiotics, including their role in inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, respiratory or genito-urinary infections or H.pylori adjuvant treatment were thought promising but inconsistent.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence supporting selected complementary and alternative medicine approaches used in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: MEDLINE (from January 1966), EMBASE (from January 1980), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched until March 2008, combining the terms irritable bowel syndrome or irritable colon with complementary therapies, alternative medicine, acupuncture, fiber, peppermint oil, herbal, traditional, yoga, massage, meditation, mind, relaxation, probiotic, hypnotherapy, psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, or behavior therapy. Results were screened to include only clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Level I evidence was available for most interventions. MAIN MESSAGE: Soluble fibre improves constipation and global IBS symptoms. Peppermint oil alleviates IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain. Probiotic trials show overall benefit for IBS but there is little evidence supporting the use of any specific strain. Hypnotherapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy are also effective therapeutic options for appropriate patients. Certain herbal formulas are supported by limited evidence, but safety is a potential concern. All interventions are supported by systematic reviews or meta-analyses. CONCLUSION: Several complementary and alternative therapies can be recommended as part of an evidence-based approach to the treatment of IBS; these might provide patients with satisfactory relief and improve the therapeutic alliance.},

We focus on understanding of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter jejuni infections, and to link these acute events with long-term consequences in a susceptible host, including irritable bowel syndrome and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Enterohemorrhagic E. coli and C. jejuni are zoonotic infections that are acquired from exposure to tainted food (undercooked hamburger and chicken, respectively) and contaminated drinking water. Noninvasive E. coli O157:H7 elaborates Shiga-like toxins and protein effectors that are injected, via a molecular syringe that is encoded by a bacterial type 3 secretion system, into infected eukaryotic cells. Less is known about the precise virulence properties of enteroinvasive Campylobacter strains, but both enteric pathogens are able to disrupt polarized epithelial monolayers resulting in increased uptake of macromolecules and antigens. SUMMARY: An improved understanding of the epidemiology, pathobiology and mechanisms underlying infectious enterocolitides will provide the basis for developing new intervention strategies including, for example, the use of probiotics, to interrupt the infectious process.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gut microflora-mucosal interactions may be involved in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIM: To investigate the efficacy of a novel prebiotic trans-galactooligosaccharide in changing the colonic microflora and improve the symptoms in IBS sufferers. METHODS: In all, 44 patients with Rome II positive IBS completed a 12-week single centre parallel crossover controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive either 3.5 g/d prebiotic, 7 g/d prebiotic or 7 g/d placebo. IBS symptoms were monitored weekly and scored according to a 7-point Likert scale. Changes in faecal microflora, stool frequency and form (Bristol stool scale) subjective global assessment (SGA), anxiety and depression and QOL scores were also monitored. RESULTS: The prebiotic significantly enhanced faecal bifidobacteria (3.5 g/d P < 0.005; 7 g/d P < 0.001). Placebo was without effect on the clinical parameters monitored, while the prebiotic at 3.5 g/d significantly changed stool consistency (P < 0.05), improved flatulence (P < 0.05) bloating (P < 0.05), composite score of symptoms (P < 0.05) and SGA (P < 0.05). The prebiotic at 7 g/d significantly improved SGA (P < 0.05) and anxiety scores (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The galactooligosaccharide acted as a prebiotic in specifically stimulating gut bifidobacteria in IBS patients and is effective in alleviating symptoms. These findings suggest that the prebiotic has potential as a therapeutic agent in IBS.},

METHODS: We randomized 74 IBS patients to receive 8 weeks of daily treatment with 400 mL milk fermented with the yoghurt bacteria and containing Lactobacillus paracasei, ssp. paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 (Cultura; active) or acidified milk without these bacteria (control). The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects reporting adequate relief of their IBS symptoms at least 50% of the weeks. IBS symptom severity, psychological symptoms and quality of life were assessed. RESULTS: The proportion of responders was 38% (14/37 patients) in the active group and 27% (10/37 patients) in the control group (P = 0.3). IBS symptom severity improved significantly in both groups during the treatment period. This change was greater in the active group during the first 2 weeks, but thereafter, no significant group differences were seen. CONCLUSIONS: We could not detect a clearly positive effect of fermented milk containing three probiotic bacteria on GI symptoms in IBS patients compared with the control treatment. However, a trend towards a more favourable effect during the first weeks was seen in the active group.},

Nine patients with severe IBS and 10 healthy subjects underwent stationary antro-duodeni-jejunal manometry; blood was sampled during similar motility phases in the two groups. The motility phases were monitored and blood samples were collected during fasting and after food intake. Plasma was analyzed for two forms of ghrelin (octanylated and desoctanylated) as well as for motilin. In IBS patients circulating motilin levels covaried with total ghrelin levels (r=0.90; p<0.004), octanylated ghrelin (r=0.77; p<0.02) and desoctanylated ghrelin (r=0.69; p<0.04). No such correlations were seen in the control group. Octanylated ghrelin comprised 35.3+/-3.9% (mean+/-SEM) of the total circulating ghrelin in the IBS patients compared to 40.4+/-4.5% (mean+/-SEM) in the control group (NS). Ghrelin covaried with motilin in plasma in IBS but not in plasma from healthy subjects. This suggests the two peptides act together in IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Controversy exists on how to measure patient-reported outcomes in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) clinical trials effectively. Pain numeric rating scales (NRS) are widely used in the non-IBS pain literature. The Food and Drug Administration has proposed using the NRS in IBS. AIM: To test the psychometrics of an abdominal pain NRS in IBS. Methods We analysed data from a longitudinal cohort of Rome III IBS subjects. At entry, subjects completed a 10-point NRS, bowel symptoms, IBS severity measurements (IBS-SSS, FBDSI), health-related quality of life indices (IBS-QOL, EQ5D), and the Worker Productivity Activity Index (WPAI). We repeated assessments at 3 months along with a response scale to calculate the minimal clinically important difference. RESULTS: There were 277 subjects (82% women; age = 42 +/- 15) at baseline and 90 at 3 months. The NRS correlated cross-sectionally with IBS-SSS (r = 0.60; P < 0.0011), FBDSI (r = 0.49; P < 0.0001), IBS-QOL (r = 0.43; P < 0.0001), EQ5D (r = 0.48; P < 0.0001), presenteeism (r = 0.39; P < 0.0001), absenteeism (r = 0.17; P = 0.04) and distension (r = 0.46; P < 0.0001), but not stool frequency or form. The minimal clinically important difference was 2.2 points, correlating with a 29.5% reduction over time. CONCLUSIONS: An abdominal pain NRS exhibits excellent validity and can be readily interpreted with a minimal clinically important difference in patients with IBS. These data support the use of the NRS in IBS clinical trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty about how to measure patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in IBS. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emphasizes that PROs must be couched in a conceptual framework, yet existing IBS PROs were not based on such a framework. AIM: To perform qualitative analyses to inform a new conceptual framework for IBS symptoms. METHODS: Following FDA guidance, we searched the literature for extant IBS questionnaires. We then performed interviews in IBS patients to learn about the illness experience in their own words. We cultivated vocabulary to inform a conceptual framework depicted with domains, sub-domains, and item categories, per FDA guidance. RESULTS: We identified 13 questionnaires with items encompassing 18 symptoms. We recruited 123 IBS patients for cognitive interviews. Major themes included: pain and discomfort are different - asking about discomfort is nonspecific and should be avoided in future PROs; bowel urgency is multifaceted - PROs should measure bowel immediacy, controllability, and predictability; and PROs should divide bloating into how it feels vs. how it looks. Symptom experience may be determined by 35-item categories within five domains: (i) pain; (ii) gas/bloat; (iii) diarrhoea; (iv) constipation; and (v) extraintestinal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: We applied FDA guidance to develop a framework that can serve as the foundation for developing a PRO for IBS clinical trials.},

   abstract = {While recent studies have indicated that the colonic mucosa in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) shows an increase in inflammatory cells, this 'inflammation' is quantitatively less than in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and of a different nature with a predominance of mast cells, particularly in female patients. Inflammation can arise via numerous pathways including infection, stress, food allergy and changes in gut microbiota. Low-grade mucosal inflammation throughout the colon and including the terminal ileum can be seen for many months after an attack of acute gastroenteritis and is a feature of post-infective IBS. Measurements of gut permeability also show a prolonged increase in both the small and large bowel in both post-infective IBS and IBS with diarrhoea predominance. This has been linked to visceral hypersensitivity, but whether this is causal or an epiphenomenon remains uncertain. Studying the risk factors for post-infective IBS has shown the importance of both local and microbiological factors, as well as psychological factors, including adverse life events, anxiety and depression. Stress in both animals and humans can activate mast cells, which (by increasing gut permeability) may allow activation of the systemic immune system. Demonstration of the importance of the low-grade inflammation observed awaits definitive large scale trials of agents designed to specifically reverse these changes.},

Specifically, the microorganisms inhabiting the gut lumen interact with the intestinal immune system, supply key nutrients for the major components of the gut wall, and modulate energy metabolism. Host-microbiome interactions can be either beneficial or deleterious, driving gastrointestinal lymphoid tissue activities and shaping gut wall structures. This overview briefly focuses on the potential role played by abnormalities in gut microbiota and relative responses of the gastrointestinal tract in the determination of important pathological conditions such as the irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer.},

   abstract = {The aims of this study were to investigate, firstly, the relationship between diet and disease activity and, secondly, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and their relationship to diet among patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) using a cross-sectional design. One hundred sixty-five individuals diagnosed with AS were invited to complete a self-administered postal questionnaire regarding demographic data, diet, medication, and gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to two established disease assessment questionnaires, i.e., the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). No significant correlation between diet and disease activity was found. Overall, 27% of the patients reported aggravating gastrointestinal problems when consuming certain foodstuff(s). The 30% of patients who reported suffering from gastrointestinal pain had significantly greater disease activity and poorer functional status according to their BASDAI and BASFI scores (p < 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively). Patients who reported gastrointestinal pain had a significantly higher consumption of vegetables (p < 0.01) and lower consumption of milk and soured milk (p = 0.04). No significant correlation was found between the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and gastrointestinal symptoms. In multiple regression models, BASDAI and the consumption of vegetables were independent and statistically significant predictors of gastrointestinal pain. To conclude, in a group of Swedish AS patients, no correlation between diet and disease activity could be detected. There were, however, correlations between diet and gastrointestinal pain. Gastrointestinal problems were also found to be prevalent in AS, independent of NSAID usage.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Constipation is a frustrating symptom affecting 3% of children worldwide. Randomised controlled trials show that both polyethylene glycol and lactulose are effective in increasing defecation frequency in children with constipation. However, in 30-50%, these children reported abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, diarrhoea, nausea and bad taste of the medication. Two recent studies have shown that the fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis strain DN-173 010 is effective in increasing stool frequency in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients with a defecation frequency < 3/week and in constipated women with a defecation frequency < 3/week. Goal of this study is to determine whether this fermented dairy product is effective in the treatment of constipated children with a defecation frequency < 3/week. METHODS/DESIGN: It is a two nation (The Netherlands and Poland) double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised multicentre trial in which 160 constipated children (age 3-16 years) with a defecation frequency <3/week will be randomly allocated to consume a fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 or a control product, twice a day, for 3 weeks. During the study all children are instructed to try to defecate on the toilet for 5-10 minutes after each meal (3 times a day) and daily complete a standardized bowel diary. Primary endpoint is stool frequency. Secondary endpoints are stool consistency, faecal incontinence frequency, pain during defecation, digestive symptoms (abdominal pain, flatulence), adverse effects (nausea, diarrhoea, bad taste) and intake of rescue medication (Bisacodyl). Rate of success and rate of responders are also evaluated, with success defined as > or = 3 bowel movements per week and < or =1 faecal incontinence episode over the last 2 weeks of product consumption and responder defined as a subject reporting a stool frequency > or = 3 on the last week of product consumption. To demonstrate that the success percentage in the intervention group will be 35% and the success percentage in the control group (acidified milk without ferments, toilet training, bowel diary) will be 15%, with alpha 0.05 and power 80%, a total sample size of 160 patients was calculated. CONCLUSION: This study is aimed to show that the fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis strain DN-173 010 is effective in increasing stool frequency after 3 weeks of product consumption in children with functional constipation and a defecation frequency < 3/week.},

   abstract = {This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and 1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants. Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.},

Use of certain probiotic preparations is widespread and the number of clinical trials undertaken with such products is unparalleled in western scientific literature. One such preparation, containing a combination of Enterococcus faecium R0026 and Bacillus subtilis R0179, has 23 publications on post-market clinical studies involving over 1,800 adults. The majority of these publications are printed in Chinese and Korean journals. This review examines the clinical findings with this probiotic combination. As mono-therapy, it has been used to overcome symptoms associated with chronic diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome. It has been used as co-adjuvant therapy with sulfasalazine and mesalazine to improve remission times in mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis and to improve compliance with conventional triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication. While the much of the data is preliminary and the study designs require refinement, the contribution of these trials should not be ignored. The information derived in this review will provide practitioners with practical information on appropriate applications for probiotic supplements, expected outcomes, dosing regimes, safety and reported adverse events. Furthermore, identification of problems in these trials should help researchers design better clinical trials when investigating probiotic products.},

Despite advances in our understanding of basic neuroenteric mechanisms and the role of effectors and transmitters in the brain-gut axis, a reliable biologic marker of IBS has yet to be identified. IBS diagnosis and status depend entirely on an assessment of IBS signs and symptoms. This has made development of optimal end points and study design for evaluation of efficacy of IBS drugs a challenge. This article addresses three main topics: the evolution of primary end points for IBS clinical trials; a potential path forward for IBS end points in new clinical trials; and recommendations for the future development of patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments for use in IBS clinical trials.},

   abstract = {WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The complexity and diversity of irritable bowel syndrome's (IBS) presentation make treatment difficult. Although there are reviews and guidelines for treating IBS, they focus on the efficacy of medications for IBS symptoms using high-priority endpoints, leaving those of lower priority largely unreported. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive evidence-based review of the efficacy of medications to treat IBS symptoms, reported by IBS subtype, including secondary symptom endpoints that are often underreported. METHODS: A review of PubMed for articles published through December 2009 using the keywords: 'irritable bowel syndrome', 'therapeutics', 'antidiarrhoeals', 'laxatives', 'loperamide', 'dietary fibre', 'psyllium', 'calcium polycarbophil', 'bulking agents', 'lubiprostone', 'antidepressant agents, tricyclics' and its representative entities, 'serotonin reuptake inhibitors' and its representative entities, 'dicyclomine', hyoscyamine', 'peppermint oil', 'parasympatholytics' and its representative entities, 'rifaximin', 'pregabalin', 'gabapentin', 'clonidine', 'octreotide', 'atropine' and 'probiotics' is provided. Placebo-controlled trials were evaluated for the strength of evidence supporting the efficacy of each medication for explicit IBS symptoms. The efficacy of each medication for the symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, stool form, mucus, urgency, feeling of incomplete evacuation, flatulence, frequency, or borborgymi and overall symptoms are reported by IBS subtype. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The literature search identified 58 placebo-controlled trials of the efficacy of medications for treating IBS symptoms, which were critically evaluated and reported. The available studies suggest improvement in various IBS symptoms with loperamide, fibre supplements, lubiprostone, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs), antispasmotics, rifaximin, pregabalin, gabapentin, clonidine, octreotide and probiotic treatments. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This review is the first to compile the available evidence on the efficacy of the various pharmacological treatments for IBS on the basis of IBS subtype and specific symptoms. This evidence is limited and more well-designed studies are required to better inform therapeutic decision-making in the management of this difficult syndrome.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Enterometabolic disturbances may cause meal-related symptoms. We performed a functional evaluation of the intestinal microflora in patients with unexplained, self-reported food hypersensitivity by measuring fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients with self-reported food hypersensitivity and 15 healthy volunteers of similar age, gender, and body mass index collected all feces for 72 hours. Fecal concentrations of acetic, propionic, n-butyric, i-butyric, n-valeric, i-valeric, n-caproic, and i-caproic acids were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. Concentrations and excretions (output) of SCFAs in patients and controls were compared and related to gastrointestinal symptoms. RESULTS: Despite nonsignificant differences between patients and controls for both total and individual SCFA concentrations and excretions, n-butyric acid comprised a higher (P = 0.035) and acetic acid a lower (P = 0.012) proportion of total SCFA in patients compared to controls. There were no significant correlations between symptom scores and concentrations or excretions of individual or total SCFAs, but the proportion of n-butyric acid was significantly higher in patients with severe symptoms compared to patients with moderate symptoms (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: The results indicate an enterometabolic disturbance in patients with self-reported food hypersensitivity. Higher proportions of n-butyric acid may be related to abdominal symptom generation, but may also protect against organic bowel disease. Further studies are needed to clarify these aspects.},

   abstract = {Chronic constipation is one of the most frequent complaints in childhood. Although there is evidence that gastrointestinal flora is important in gut motility, there is little evidence that gut flora is abnormal in constipation. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increase stool frequency and decrease consistency in normal individuals. But, according to several reviews, the evidence of probiotics for efficacy in constipation is limited. Fiber supplements, lactose-free diets, and lactobacillus supplementation are effective in the management of children with recurrent abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome. Several studies with Lactobacillus GG in children showed negative results in children with chronic constipation. Because Bifidobacterium animalis DN-173 010 has been shown to be effective in adults with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome this study should also be performed in a well-designed large placebo-controlled trial in children with constipation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional illness associated with significant impairment in quality of life. Compared to men, women are more likely to meet criteria for IBS, to seek treatment, and experience greater detriments in quality of life. In addition to physiological factors, psychosocial factors may contribute to such gender differences. We examined whether traits associated with masculine (agentic) and feminine (communal) gender roles were linked with adjustment to IBS. METHODS: Women with IBS (N = 144) completed online self-report measures of gender-related traits (agency, communion, unmitigated agency, unmitigated communion, lack of agency, lack of communion), IBS-specific quality of life (IBS-QOL), and psychological adjustment (negative and positive affect). RESULTS: Agency was positively associated with all dimensions of IBS-QOL and psychological adjustment. Select dimensions of IBS-QOL were lower among women higher in unmitigated agency (social reactions, body image) or unmitigated communion (interference with activity), and both traits were associated with increased negative affect. Lack of agency was associated with increased IBS-QOL (food avoidance) and decreased positive affect. Communion and lack of communion were not associated with either IBS-QOL or psychological adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Findings may help elucidate psychosocial factors contributing to quality of life among women with IBS.},

   abstract = {Media reports on probiotics have been conflicting which has led to increased confusion among the general population and also among health professionals. To disentangle myths and reality, the British Nutrition Foundation has carried out a review on probiotics and health. There is good evidence that probiotics are effective in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and, although only few studies have been carried out so far, probiotic microorganisms also seem to have the potential to prevent the potentially fatal Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea. A limited number of studies that are available on the effectiveness of probiotics on constipation have shown conflicting results, but promising results have been found for certain strains. Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms have been found to be reduced by consuming probiotic strains, although a high placebo effect has been observed in some of the studies. The field of probiotics is relatively new and more studies will be needed to allow firm conclusions on the effectiveness of probiotic microorganisms for certain health issues.},

AIM: To investigate the effect of LAB4, a multistrain probiotic preparation on symptoms of IBS. This probiotic preparation has not previously been assessed in IBS. METHODS: Fifty-two participants with IBS, as defined by the Rome II criteria, participated in this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Participants were randomized to receive either a probiotic preparation comprising two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 (NCIMB 30157) and CUL21 (NCIMB 30156), Bifidobacterium lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172) and Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) at a total of 2.5 x 10(10) cfu/capsule or a placebo for 8 weeks. Participants reported their IBS symptoms using a questionnaire fortnightly during the intervention and at 2 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: A significantly greater improvement in the Symptom Severity Score of IBS and in scores for quality of life, days with pain and satisfaction with bowel habit was observed over the 8-week intervention period in the volunteers receiving the probiotic preparation than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: LAB4 multistrain probiotic supplement may benefit subjects with IBS.},

BACKGROUND: In the United States, there has been a recent increase in research investigating the therapeutic capacities of probiotics in human disease and an accompanying increase in product availability and marketing. How medical care providers have interpreted the available literature and incorporated it into their practice has not been earlier assessed. STUDY: A 16-question survey (see Survey, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JCG/A14) was distributed to practicing gastroenterologists and physicians with a specific interest in GI disorders within a large metropolitan area. RESULTS: All physicians responded that they believed probiotics to be safe for most patients and 98% responded that probiotics have a role in treating gastrointestinal illnesses or symptoms. Currently 93% of physicians have patients taking probiotics most often for irritable bowel syndrome. Commonly used probiotics included yogurt-based products, Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 (Align), and VSL#3. Most surveyed physicians recommended probiotics for irritable bowel syndrome, antibiotic, and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea because they believed that the literature supports their usage for these conditions. However, physician practice patterns did not consistently correlate with published, expert-panel-generated recommendations for evidence-based probiotic use. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests most gastrointestinal disease specialists recognize a role for and have used probiotics as part of their therapeutic armamentarium; however, the effective implementation of this practice will benefit from additional supporting studies and the eventual development of clinical practice guidelines supported by the major gastroenterology societies.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The pharmacology, uses, dosages, safety, drug interactions, and contraindications of probiotics are reviewed. SUMMARY: Probiotics are live nonpathogenic microorganisms administered to improve microbial balance, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. They consist of Saccharomyces boulardii yeast or lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, and are regulated as dietary supplements and foods. Probiotics exert their beneficial effects through various mechanisms, including lowering intestinal pH, decreasing colonization and invasion by pathogenic organisms, and modifying the host immune response. Probiotic benefits associated with one species or strain do not necessarily hold true for others. The strongest evidence for the clinical effectiveness of probiotics has been in the treatment of acute diarrhea, most commonly due to rotavirus, and pouchitis. More research is needed to clarify the role of probiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection, travelers' diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and vulvovaginal candidiasis. There is no consensus about the minimum number of microorganisms that must be ingested to obtain a beneficial effect; however, a probiotic should typically contain several billion microorganisms to increase the chance that adequate gut colonization will occur. Probiotics are generally considered safe and well tolerated, with bloating and flatulence occurring most frequently. They should be used cautiously in patients who are critically ill or severely immunocompromised or those with central venous catheters since systemic infections may rarely occur. Bacteria-derived probiotics should be separated from antibiotics by at least two hours. CONCLUSION: Probiotics have demonstrated efficacy in preventing and treating various medical conditions, particularly those involving the gastrointestinal tract. Data supporting their role in other conditions are often conflicting.},

METHODS: we tested sera of 78 unrelated Han Chinese patients (5 IDDM and 73 D-IBS), using ELISA serological tests for IgG anti-gliadin antibodies (IgG-AGA) and IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA-tTG). RESULTS: six out of 78 patients (7.7%) were positive for IgG-AGA (two men and four women) and two (2.6%) were positive for IgA-tTGs. One of the latter patients was negative for IgG-AGA. Besides, one patient had a dubious IgA-tTG antibody and a positive IgG-AGA. None of the six patients agreed to undergo duodenal biopsy. Two out of these six patients followed a gluten-free diet for one year. In one patient the diarrhoea ceased and his body weight increased. Another stopped losing weight. CONCLUSIONS: this study previously published as a letter in GUT (Wu J, Xia B, von Blomberg BME, Zhao C, Yang XW, Crusius JBA, Pena AS. Coeliac disease: emerging in China? Gut 2010; 59(3): 418-9) demonstrated that CD may exist in the Jiangsu province of P.R. China. The present article draws attention to the difficulties of following a standard protocol in China such as established in western countries and highlights important factors less well known in the west in relation to the development of CD in China. Wheat production became significant in China between 1600 and 1300 B.C. After the Han dynasty (500-200 B.C.), wheat was one of the main cereals in China. One the major wheat fields in China is located in the Jiangsu province where the research for this article was performed. A review of Chinese literature shows that the predominant HLA-DQ CD risk alleles and haplotypes are present in the Jiangsu province. Genetic background, food consumption, and the results of our study suggest that CD should actively be investigated in P.R. China.},

   abstract = {The term "food allergy" is widely misused for all sorts of symptoms and diseases caused by food. Food allergy (FA) is an adverse reaction to food (food hypersensitivity) occurring in susceptible individuals, which is mediated by a classical immune mechanism specific for the food itself. The best established mechanism in FA is due to the presence of IgE antibodies against the offending food. Food intolerance (FI) are all non-immune-mediated adverse reactions to food. The subgroups of FI are enzymatic (e.g. lactose intolerance due to lactase deficiency), pharmacological (reactions against biogenic amines, histamine intolerance), and undefined food intolerance (e.g. against some food additives). The diagnosis of an IgE-mediated FA is made by a carefully taken case history, supported by the demonstration of an IgE sensitization either by skin prick tests or by in vitro tests, and confirmed by positive oral provocation. For scientific purposes the only accepted test for the confirmation of FA/FI is a properly performed double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). A panel of recombinant allergens, produced as single allergenic molecules, may in future improve the diagnosis of IgE-mediated FA. Due to a lack of causal treatment possibilities, the elimination of the culprit "food allergen" from the diet is the only therapeutic option for patients with real food allergy.},

   abstract = {The influence of fungal colonization on the course of ulcerative colitis (UC) has not been thoroughly studied. We determined the activity of the disease using clinical, endoscopic and histological index (IACH) criteria in UC patients with fungal colonization and the healing process of UC induced by an intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in rats infected with Candida, without and with antifungal (fluconazole) or probiotic (lacidofil) treatment. The intensity of the healing of the colonic lesions was assessed by macro- and microscopic criteria as well as functional alterations in colonic blood flow (CBF). Myeloperoxidase (MPO) content and plasma proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels were evaluated. Candida more frequently colonized patients with a history of UC within a 5-year period, when compared with those of shorter duration of IBS. Among Candida strains colonizing intestinal mucosa, Candida albicans was identified in 91% of cases. Significant inhibition of the UC activity index as reflected by clinical, endoscopical and histological criteria was observed in the Candida group treated with fluconazole, when compared to that without antifungal treatment. In the animal model, Candida infection significantly delayed the healing of TNBS-induced UC, decreased the CBF and raised the plasma IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels, with these effects reversed by fluconazole or lacidofil treatment. We conclude that 1) Candida delays healing of UC in both humans and that induced by TNBS in rats, and 2) antifungal therapy and probiotic treatment during Candida infection could be beneficial in the restoration and healing of colonic damage in UC.},
