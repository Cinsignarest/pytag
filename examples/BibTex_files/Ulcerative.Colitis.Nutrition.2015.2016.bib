   abstract = {We aim to review the literature and provide guidance on preventive health measures in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Structured searches were performed in PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from January 1976 to June 2016 using the following keywords: (inflammatory bowel disease OR Crohn's disease OR ulcerative colitis) AND (health maintenance OR preventive health OR health promotion). Abstracts of the articles selected from each of these multiple searches were reviewed, and those meeting the inclusion criteria (that is, providing data regarding preventive health or health maintenance in IBD patients) were recorded. Reference lists from the selected articles were manually reviewed to identify further relevant studies. Patients with IBD are at increased risk of developing adverse events related to the disease course, therapeutic interventions, or non-adherence to medication. Recent studies have suggested that IBD patients do not receive preventive services with the same thoroughness as patients with other chronic diseases. Preventive health measures can avert morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients with IBD. Gastroenterologists and primary care physicians (PCPs) should have an up to date working knowledge of preventive health measures for IBD patients. A holistic approach and better communication between gastroenterologists and PCPs with explicit clarification of roles will prevent duplication of services and streamline care.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis [UC] is associated with colonic mucosa barrier defects and bacterial dysbiosis, but these features may simply be the result of inflammation. Therefore, we sought to assess whether these features are inherently abrogated in the terminal ileum [TI] of UC patients, where inflammation is absent. METHODS: TI biopsies from paediatric inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] subsets [Crohn's disease [CD; n = 13] and UC [n = 10]], and non-IBD disease controls [n = 12] were histologically graded, and alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff stained biopsies were quantified. The mucosal barrier was assessed for mucin [MUC2], immunoglobulin [Ig]A, IgG, and total bacteria (fluorescence in-situ hybridisation [FISH probe EUB338]) by immunofluorescence. The regulation of mucin secretion was investigated by NLRP6 gene expression and immunofluorescence. The composition of the active mucosa-associated microbiota was explored by sequencing the 16S rRNA amplicon generated from total RNA. RESULTS: Despite the absence of ileitis, UC patients displayed ileal barrier depletion illustrated by reductions in mucin-containing goblet cells and mucin production and altered epithelial NLRP6 expression. In both CD patients with ileitis and UC patients with normal histology, bacteria coated with IgA and IgG penetrated the TI mucin layer. Biopsy 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a reduction in alpha-diversity by three methods [Shannon, Simpson, and Equitability indices] between UC and non-IBD paediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an underlying defect in the UC-afflicted intestinal tract even in the absence of inflammation, implicating barrier and microbial changes as primary abnormalities in UC that may play a causative role in disease development.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU) is the rarest IBD subtype with treatment based on extrapolation from ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) studies. We compared IBDU treatment choices with other colonic IBDs and explored long-term outcomes. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective longitudinal study of 23 centers of pediatric IBD with isolated colitis, including a mild ileitis consistent with backwash. RESULTS: Of note, 797 children (median age: 11.6 years, range: 2-18.4) were included: 250 with CD, 287 with UC, and 260 with IBDU (median follow-up: 2.8 [interquartile range: 1.6-4.2] years). IBDU differed from UC with lower corticosteroid (154 [59%] versus 204 [71%]; P = 0.004) and higher exclusive enteral nutrition use (26 [10%] versus 2 [0.6%]; P < 0.0001). Compared to patients with CD, patients with IBDU received less exclusive enteral nutrition and immunomodulators (26 [10%] versus 93 [37%]; P < 0.0001 and 67 [26%] versus 129 [52%]; P < 0.0001, respectively) but more aminosalicylates (228 [88%] versus 159 [64%]; P < 0.0001). Biological treatment was significantly higher in CD (82 [34%]) than in IBDU and UC (24 [12%] and 47 [17%], respectively; P < 0.0001). At last follow-up, 135 (69%) patients with IBDU had remission/mild disease activity compared with 100 (46%; P < 0.0001) patients with CD and 174 (64%; P = 0.3) patients with UC. Four (2%) of 194 patients with IBDU underwent surgery compared with 22 (8%) of 270 patients with UC (P = 0.009) and 20 (8%) of 238 patients with CD (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBDU have a lower medication burden and lower surgery rates than other IBD subtypes. The disease course at follow-up is generally mild, supporting an initial trial with 5-ASA before using more aggressive therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed at describing the efficacy of azathioprine (AZA) in pediatric ulcerative colitis, comparing the outcomes of early (0-6 months) versus late (6-24 months) initiation of therapy. METHODS: Children with ulcerative colitis treated with AZA within 24 months of diagnosis were included. Corticosteroid (CS)-free remission and mucosal healing (MH), assessed by endoscopy or fecal calprotectin, at 12 months were the primary outcomes. Patients were also compared for CS-free remission and MH, need for treatment escalation or surgery, number of hospitalizations, and adverse events during a 24-month follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 121 children entered the study (median age 10.5 +/- 4.0 years, 59% girls). Seventy-six (63%) started AZA between 0 and 6 months (early group) and 45 (37%) started between 6 and 24 months (late group). Seventy-five percent and 53% of patients in the early and late group, respectively, received CS at the diagnosis (P = 0.01). CS-free remission at 1 year was achieved by 30 (50%) of the early and 23 (57%) of the late patients (P = 0.54). MH occurred in 37 (37%) patients at 1 year, with no difference between the 2 groups (33% early, 42% late; P = 0.56). No difference was found for the other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of AZA within 6 months of diagnosis seems not more effective than later treatment to achieve CS-free remission in pediatric ulcerative colitis. MH does not depend on the timing of AZA initiation; however, because of the incomplete comparability of the 2 groups at the diagnosis and the use of fecal calprotectin as a surrogate marker of MH, our results should be further confirmed by prospective studies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to determine the presence of endothelial dysfunction by measuring aortic intima-media thickness (aIMT) and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and to evaluate the role of traditional risk factors for premature atherosclerosis in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Thirty-four children with IBD (25 Crohn disease [CD] and 9 ulcerative colitis [UC]; mean age 11.1 years) and 27 healthy subjects matched for sex and age were enrolled. In all of the patients, demographic characteristics and risk factors for atherosclerosis (age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, dyslipidemia, active and passive smoking, and family history for cardiovascular diseases), CD and UC clinical activity scores, and inflammatory markers were evaluated. aIMT and cIMT were measured by high-resolution B-mode ultrasound. RESULTS: aIMT was significantly higher in patients than in controls (P < 0.0005). No significant differences were found for cIMT, although the carotid thickness was higher in patients with IBD than in healthy subjects. At a univariate analysis, inflammatory markers levels and tobacco smoking exposure were significantly related to higher aIMT values, whereas in a multivariate regression model, the inflammatory status was the only independent variable correlated with high aIMT. CONCLUSIONS: aIMT is an earlier marker of preclinical atherosclerosis than cIMT in young children with active IBD. The inflammatory status and the smoking exposure are significantly correlated with the premature endothelial dysfunction. These data emphasize the importance of controlling the chronic intestinal inflammation and endorsing smoke-free environments for children and adolescents with IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although gastritis and esophagitis are well studied in children, there is very limited literature on duodenitis in children. We aimed to assess the prevalence, etiology, clinical, endoscopic, and pathological features in a large cohort of unselected children with duodenitis. METHODS: We reviewed the pathology reports of all the upper endoscopies performed at our institution during 5 years to identify children with duodenitis. Biopsy sections were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of duodenitis. Demographic, clinical, endoscopic data, and the presence of associated gastritis and esophagitis were noted in all of the children with duodenitis. The etiology of duodenitis was correlated with the patients' clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: Out of 2772 children who had endoscopy, 352 had duodenitis with the prevalence rate of 12.7%. Gastritis was seen in 64% of children with duodenitis compared with 46% of children without duodenitis (P < 0.001). Common indications for endoscopy in children with duodenitis were abdominal pain, positive celiac serology, and diarrhea. The most common etiology was celiac disease (32%), followed by Crohn disease (13%), ulcerative colitis (3%), and Helicobacter pylori infection (6%). In 63% of cases, the endoscopic appearance of duodenum was normal. Cryptitis, villous changes, and cellular infiltration were noted on histology. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of duodenitis is 12.7% in children undergoing endoscopy. Celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease are common causes of duodenitis. Associated gastritis is common in children with duodenitis, and the correlation of endoscopic appearance with histology is poor.},

   abstract = {Recently, increasing interest in natural dietary and therapeutic preparations used as dietary supplements has been observed. One of them is frankincense. This traditional medicine of the East is believed to have anti-inflammatory, expectorant, antiseptic, and even anxiolytic and anti-neurotic effects. The present study aims to verify the reported therapeutic properties of Boswellia resin and describe its chemical composition based on available scientific studies. The main component of frankincense is oil (60%). It contains mono- (13%) and diterpenes (40%) as well as ethyl acetate (21.4%), octyl acetate (13.4%) and methylanisole (7.6%). The highest biological activity among terpenes is characteristic of 11-keto-ss-acetyl-beta-boswellic acid, acetyl-11-keto-ss-boswellic acid and acetyl-alpha-boswellic acid. Contemporary studies have shown that resin indeed has an analgesic, tranquilising and anti-bacterial effects. From the point of view of therapeutic properties, extracts from Boswellia serrata and Boswellia carterii are reported to be particularly useful. They reduce inflammatory conditions in the course of rheumatism by inhibiting leukocyte elastase and degrading glycosaminoglycans. Boswellia preparations inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and prevent the release of leukotrienes, thus having an anti-inflammatory effect in ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, bronchitis and sinusitis. Inhalation and consumption of Boswellia olibanum reduces the risk of asthma. In addition, boswellic acids have an antiproliferative effect on tumours.

They have an anti-tumour effect since they inhibit topoisomerase I and II-alpha and stimulate programmed cell death (apoptosis).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Phase 3 trials have shown the efficacy of vedolizumab, which binds to integrin alpha4beta7, in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). We investigated the effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab in patients who failed anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. METHODS: From June through December 2014, there were 173 patients with CD and 121 patients with UC who were included in a multicenter nominative compassionate early access program granted by French regulatory agencies. This program provided patients with access to vedolizumab before it was authorized for marketing. Vedolizumab (300 mg) was administered intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6, and then every 8 weeks. Disease activity was assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index for CD and the partial Mayo Clinic score for UC. We report results obtained after the 14-week induction phase. RESULTS: Among the 294 patients treated with vedolizumab (mean age, 39.5 +/- 14.0 y; mean disease duration, 10.8 +/- 7.6 y; concomitant steroids, 44% of cases), 276 completed the induction period, however, 18 discontinued vedolizumab because of a lack of response (n = 14), infusion-related reaction (n = 2), or infections (n = 2). At week 14, 31% of patients with CD were in steroid-free clinical remission and 51% had a response; among patients with UC, 36% were in steroid-free clinical remission and 50% had a response. No deaths were reported. Severe adverse events occurred in 24 patients (8.2%), including 15 (5.1%) that led to vedolizumab discontinuation (1 case of pulmonary tuberculosis and 1 rectal adenocarcinoma). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of patients with CD or UC who failed previous anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy, approximately one third of patients achieved steroid-free clinical remission after 14 weeks of induction therapy with vedolizumab. This agent had an acceptable safety profile in these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC); yet, there are few prospective studies of dietary factors. None have examined the association between adolescent diet and risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (CD and UC). METHODS: This study included women enrolled in Nurses' Health Study II who completed a validated high school dietary questionnaire in 1998. We examined the effect of dietary patterns (prudent or Western diet) and individual components of each patterns. We documented incident cases of CD and UC through 2011 based on physician review of medical records and used Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for confounders to estimate hazard ratios and confidence intervals for CD and UC. RESULTS: Over 763,229 person-years of follow-up, we identified 70 incident cases of CD and 103 cases of UC. Compared with women in the lowest quartile of a prudent diet score (characterized by greater intake of fruits, vegetables, and fish), women in the highest quartile had a 53% lower risk of CD (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.98; P trend = 0.04). Specifically, greater intake of fish (P trend = 0.01) and fiber (P trend = 0.06) were associated with lower risk of CD. In contrast, Western diet score was not associated with risk of CD. Neither dietary patterns nor individual food or nutrient groups was associated with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent diet is associated with risk of CD, but not UC, offering insights into disease pathogenesis.},

In a prospective cohort study of 1659 patients with Crohn's disease and 946 patients with ulcerative colitis seen at 7 high-volume referral centers, we collected data on demographics, disease characteristics, and medical and surgical treatments. We used logistic regression to determine differences in treatment among centers, controlling for potential confounders. We found significant variations among centers in the treatment of Crohn's disease with immunomodulators (odds ratio [OR], 3.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09-5.32) but not anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.97-2.77). There was less variation in the treatment of ulcerative colitis; we found no difference in use of immunomodulators (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.00-3.36) or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.40-1.65). The development and implementation of evidence-based standards of care for inflammatory bowel disease may help reduce variation and improve outcomes.},

This study evaluated the effects of pretreatment or treatment with arginine by oral administration on intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation (BT), and mucosal intestinal damage due to colitis. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were distributed into 4 groups: standard diet and water (C: control group), standard diet and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) solution (Col: colitis group), 2% L-arginine supplementation for 7 days prior to DSS administration and during disease induction (PT: pretreated group), and 2% L-arginine supplementation during disease induction (T: treated group). Colitis was induced by administration of 1.5% DSS for 7 days. After 14 days, intestinal permeability and BT were evaluated; colons were collected for histologic analysis and determination of cytokines; feces were collected for measurement of immunoglobulin A (IgA). RESULTS: The Col group showed increased intestinal permeability (C vs Col: P < .05) and BT (C vs Col: P < .05). In the arginine-supplemented groups (PT and T), this amino acid tended to decrease intestinal permeability. Arginine decreased BT to liver during PT (P < .05) and to blood, liver, spleen, and lung during T (P < .05). Histologic analysis showed that arginine preserved the intestinal mucosa and tended to decreased inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Arginine attenuates weight loss and BT in mice with colitis.},

Obesity, which was once an uncommon occurrence in such patients, has grown in this population at the same prevalence rate as that found in the general population, bringing with it an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Objective The aim of the present study was to determine the nutritional status and occurrence of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: A case-series cross-sectional study was conducted involving male and female adult outpatients with inflammatory bowel disease. Data were collected on demographic, socioeconomic, clinical and anthropometric variables as well as the following cardiovascular risk factors: sedentary lifestyle, excess weight, abdominal obesity, medications in use, comorbidities, alcohol intake and smoking habits. The significance level for all statistical tests was set to 5% (P< 0.05). RESULTS: The sample comprised 80 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, 56 of whom (70.0%) had ulcerative colitis and 24 of whom (30.0%) had Crohn's disease. Mean age was 40.3+/-11 years and the female genre accounted for 66.2% of the sample. High frequencies of excess weight (48.8%) and abdominal obesity (52.5%) were identified based on the body mass index and waist circumference, respectively, in both groups, especially among those with ulcerative colitis. Muscle depletion was found in 52.5% of the sample based on arm muscle circumference, with greater depletion among patients with Crohn's disease (P=0.008). The most frequent risk factors for cardiovascular disease were a sedentary lifestyle (83.8%), abdominal obesity (52.5%) and excess weight (48.8%). CONCLUSION: The results of the complete anthropometric evaluation draw one's attention to a nutritional paradox, with high frequencies of both - muscle depletion, as well as excess weight and abdominal obesity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (PIBD) is a chronic condition seen in genetically predisposed individuals. Genome-wide association studies have implicated >160 genomic loci in IBD with many genes coding for proteins in key immune pathways. This study looks at autoimmune disease burden in patients diagnosed with PIBD and interrogates exome data of a subset of patients. METHODS: Patients were recruited from the Southampton Genetics of PIBD cohort. Clinical diagnosis of autoimmune disease in these individuals was ascertained from medical records. For a subset of patients with PIBD and concurrent asthma, exome data was interrogated to ascertain the burden of pathogenic variants within genes implicated in asthma. Association testing was conducted between cases and population controls using the SKAT-O test. RESULTS: Forty-nine (28.3%) PIBD children (18.49% CD, 8.6% UC, and 21.15% IBDU patients) had a concurrent clinical diagnosis of at least one other autoimmune disorder; asthma was the most prevalent, affecting 16.2% of the PIBD cohort. Rare and common variant association testing revealed 6 significant genes (P < 0.05) before Bonferroni adjustment. Three of these genes were previously implicated in both asthma and IBD (ZPBP2 IL1R1, and IL18R1) and 3 in asthma only (PYHIN1, IL2RB, and GSTP1). CONCLUSIONS: One-third of our cohort had a concurrent autoimmune condition. We observed higher incidence of asthma compared with the overall pediatric prevalence. Despite a small sample size, SKAT-O evaluated a significant burden of rare and common mutations in 6 genes. Variant burden suggests that a systemic immune dysregulation rather than organ-specific could underpin immune dysfunction for a subset of patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading malignancies worldwide, therefore cheap noninvasive screening methods are of great importance. Matrix-metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) has a role in the progression of CRC, and its level is elevated in tumour biopsies. Faecal MMP-9 levels are increased in active ulcerative colitis patients, but in CRC patients, they have never been measured. We aimed to assess the faecal MMP-9 levels in patients undergoing total colonoscopy according to endoscopic and histological diagnosis. METHODS: One hundred and nine patients provided faecal samples for MMP-9 analysis. A total colonoscopy was performed; suspicious lesions were evaluated by histology. Faecal MMP-9 levels were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: The number of patients allocated to different groups were: negative/diverticulosis: 34 (referred to as controls); hyperplastic polyps: 15; adenomas: 32 (22 at high risk); and CRC: 28. Faecal MMP-9 was significantly increased in CRC compared with all other groups (P<0.001). Faecal MMP-9 was suitable to distinguish CRC patients from controls (sensitivity: 89.3%; specificity: 91.2%). By means of a lower cutoff level, faecal MMP-9 identified high-risk adenomas besides CRC (sensitivity: 76%; specificity: 85.3%). This lower cutoff level screened 59% of high-risk adenomas. CONCLUSIONS: Faecal MMP-9 may be a promising new noninvasive marker in CRC.},

In this study, we compare histologic features of IBD with STI colitis caused by syphilis and lymphogranuloma venereum. METHODS: The STI colitis group included 10 unique colorectal biopsy specimens in patients with clinically confirmed syphilis and/or lymphogranuloma venereum. The STI biopsy specimens were compared with patients matched for age, sex, and site with Crohn disease (n = 10) or ulcerative colitis (n = 10). All IBD controls had an established history of IBD (up to 276 months of follow-up, mean follow-up = 102 months). RESULTS: Discriminating features (P < .05) of STI colitis included its exclusive identification in human immunodeficiency virus-positive men who have sex with men, anal pain, and anal discharge. STI colitis contained the triad of (1) minimal active chronic crypt centric damage, (2) a lack of mucosal eosinophilia, and (3) submucosal plasma cells, endothelial swelling, and perivascular plasma cells. Nondiscriminating features (P > .05) included rectal bleeding, endoscopic appearance, skip lesions, ulcerations, aphthoid lesions, granulomata, foreign body giant cells, neural hyperplasia, fibrosis, and lymphoid aggregates. CONCLUSIONS: While STI colitis shares many overlapping features with IBD, histologic and clinical discriminating features may be helpful when confronted with that differential diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) belongs to inflammatory bowel disorders, a group of gastrointestinal disorders that can produce serious recurring diarrhea in affected patients. The mechanism for UC- and inflammatory bowel disorder-associated diarrhea is not well understood. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel plays an important role in fluid and water transport across the intestinal mucosa. CFTR channel function is regulated in a compartmentalized manner through the formation of CFTR-containing macromolecular complexes at the plasma membrane. In this study, we demonstrate the involvement of a novel macromolecular signaling pathway that causes diarrhea in UC. We found that a nitric oxide-producing enzyme, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), is overexpressed under the plasma membrane and generates compartmentalized cGMP in gut epithelia in UC. The scaffolding protein Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2) bridges iNOS with CFTR, forming CFTR-NHERF2-iNOS macromolecular complexes that potentiate CFTR channel function via the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway under inflammatory conditions both in vitro and in vivo. Potential disruption of these complexes in Nherf2(-/-) mice may render them more resistant to CFTR-mediated secretory diarrhea than Nherf2(+/+) mice in murine colitis models. Our study provides insight into the mechanism of pathophysiologic occurrence of diarrhea in UC and suggests that targeting CFTR and CFTR-containing macromolecular complexes will ameliorate diarrheal symptoms and improve conditions associated with inflammatory bowel disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Paris classification (PC) of paediatric inflammatory bowel disease categorises disease extent and therefore affects treatment decisions. Histological (microscopic) disease extent is not incorporated, and endoscopic (macroscopic) findings may underrepresent disease extent when compared with histological findings; this study compares disease extent at presentation. METHODS: Data were obtained of patients <17 years of age diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease from 2010 to 2013 at University Hospital Southampton. Data are presented as percentage of patients undergoing endoscopy. PC was performed alongside a modified PC by histological disease location. RESULTS: A total of 172 patients were identified (median age at diagnosis 13.5 years, 115 boys); Crohn disease (CD) 107, ulcerative colitis (UC) 50, inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU) 15; 159 had undergone upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, 163 had undergone lower GI endoscopy. Histological disease was more extensive at all points for CD, UC, and IBDU. CD--endoscopic ileal disease in 49% of patients compared with histological disease in 71.3%. Comparing PC--a 10% increase in L3 disease (ileocolonic), a 24% increase in L3 + L4a disease (ileocolonic plus upper GI), and a 27% increase in all of the upper GI involvement if histological disease extent was used. UC--the most common disease location was the rectum (endoscopic 91.5% vs histological 93.6%) and descending colon (endoscopic 89.4% vs histological 95.7%). Comparing PC--a 19% increase in E4 disease (pancolitis) if histological disease extent was used. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that histological disease extent is greater than endoscopic disease extent. This should be considered when the PC is used. Further study is needed to elucidate which classification would better predict disease outcome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Different practice guidelines and consensus statements for both pediatric- and adult-onset inflammatory bowel disease exist. Although variations in medical care among gastroenterologists are common, it is unknown whether there are fundamental differences between disciplines. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate differences in common practices across disciplines. METHODS: This was a prospective, questionnaire-based survey of gastroenterologists attending gastroenterology meetings in Israel. The questionnaire covered attitudes to medical resources, diagnostic and follow-up measures as well as therapeutic approaches. RESULTS: Overall, 120 (60%) of the approached adult gastroenterologists (AGs) and 49 (75%) pediatric gastroenterologists (PGs) completed the questionnaire. The 2 groups differed significantly in various practice areas. Pediatric patients are seen more frequently and for longer appointments. PGs tend to assess thiopurine metabolites (96% vs 47%) more often during treatment. There is a significant variation in practice between groups concerning infectious serology status and vaccinations. Methotrexate in Crohn patients is used more commonly by PGs (55% vs 22%). Long-term combination therapy of thiopurines and anti-tumor necrosis factoralpha agents is used more often by AGs. In patients with ulcerative colitis AGs use oral 5-aminosalicylic acid once daily (51% vs 21%) and add rectal agents from the first day of treatment (72% vs 35%) more often as compared with PGs. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that common practices in inflammatory bowel disease patients differ significantly between adult and pediatric practitioners. These findings call for investigating the reasons for these differences and promoting strategies to diminish these gaps.},

The aim of this study was to assess school-related quality of life and school absenteeism in children with IBD, compared with FAP and healthy controls. METHODS: School absenteeism and participation in school and after-school activities data were obtained for 43 children with Crohn disease (CD), 31 children with ulcerative colitis (UC), 42 children with FAP, and 30 age-matched healthy controls for the 2013-2014 school year. We used a semistructured questionnaire for both children and parents. For diminishing recall bias, absenteeism data were cross-matched with the patient's school annual report cards. RESULTS: Children with FAP, CD, and UC missed significantly more school days than age-matched healthy controls (17.6 [8.75-30], 24 [14-30], and 21 [12-25] vs 5.1 [3.75-6.25], respectively, P < 0.001). Compared with children with FAP, absenteeism because of medical appointments and hospitalization was significantly greater in children with CD and UC (8.8 [4-14] and 7.1 [3-10] vs 4.4 [2-6.25], P = 0.001). Participation of children with FAP and IBD in various school and after-school activities was significantly reduced compared with healthy controls. There was no difference in school attendance and functioning between children with IBD and FAP. CONCLUSIONS: FAP has a significant impact on school attendance and functioning similar to IBD. These findings show that significant psychosocial and academic difficulties are faced not only by children with chronic diseases like IBD but also by children with FAP.},

We tested the hypothesis that LACC1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in addition to CD, are associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA, non-systemic), and another major form of inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis (UC). We selected 11 LACC1 tagging SNPs, and tested their effect on disease risk in 3855 Swedish individuals from three case-control cohorts of CD, UC and JIA. We detected false discovery rate corrected significant associations with individual markers in all three cohorts, thereby expanding previous results for CD also to UC and JIA. LACC1's link to several inflammatory diseases suggests a key role in the human immune system and justifies further characterization of its function(s).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic variation in the Laccase (multicopper oxidoreductase) domain-containing 1 (LACC1) gene has been shown to affect the risk of Crohn's disease, leprosy and, more recently, ulcerative colitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. LACC1 function appears to promote fatty-acid oxidation, with concomitant inflammasome activation, reactive oxygen species production, and anti-bacterial responses in macrophages. We sought to contribute to elucidating LACC1 biological function by extensive characterization of its expression in human tissues and cells, and through preliminary analyses of the regulatory mechanisms driving such expression. METHODS: We implemented Western blot, quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry analyses to investigate fatty acid metabolism-immune nexus (FAMIN; the LACC1 encoded protein) expression in subcellular compartments, cell lines and relevant human tissues. Gene-set enrichment analyses were performed to initially investigate modulatory mechanisms of LACC1 expression. A small-interference RNA knockdown in vitro model system was used to study the effect of FAMIN depletion on peroxisome function. RESULTS: FAMIN expression was detected in macrophage-differentiated THP-1 cells and several human tissues, being highest in neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells among peripheral blood cells. Subcellular co-localization was exclusively confined to peroxisomes, with some additional positivity for organelle endomembrane structures. LACC1 co-expression signatures were enriched for genes involved in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling pathways, and PPAR ligands downregulated FAMIN expression in in vitro model systems. CONCLUSION: FAMIN is a peroxisome-associated protein with primary role(s) in macrophages and other immune cells, where its metabolic functions may be modulated by PPAR signaling events. However, the precise molecular mechanisms through which FAMIN exerts its biological effects in immune cells remain to be elucidated.},

   abstract = {Diet and nutritional factors have emerged as possible interventions for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which are characterised by chronic uncontrolled inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Microalgal species are a promising source of n-3 PUFA and derived oxylipins, which are lipid mediators with a key role in the resolution of inflammation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of an oxylipin-containing lyophilised biomass from Chlamydomonas debaryana on a recurrent 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis mice model. Moderate chronic inflammation of the colon was induced in BALB/c mice by weekly intracolonic instillations of low dose of TNBS. Administration of the lyophilised microalgal biomass started 2 weeks before colitis induction and was continued throughout colitis development. Mice were killed 48 h after the last TNBS challenge. Oral administration of the microalgal biomass reduced TNBS-induced intestinal inflammation, evidenced by an inhibition of body weight loss, an improvement in colon morphology and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-17. This product also down-regulated colonic expressions of inducible nitric oxide, cyclo-oxygenase 2 and NF-kappaB, as well as increased PPAR-gamma. In addition, lyophilised microalgal biomass up-regulated the expressions of the antioxidant transcription factor nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 and the target gene heme oxygenase 1. This study describes for the first time the prophylactic effects of an oxylipin-containing lyophilised microalgae biomass from C. debaryana in the acute phase of a recurrent TNBS-induced colitis model in mice. These findings suggest the potential use of this microalga, or derived oxylipins, as a nutraceutical in the treatment of IBD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: We sought to investigate the value of neutrophil volume distribution width in detecting inflammatory bowel disease activation. METHODS: Patients with infection and accompanying inflammatory disease were excluded. All the patients were diagnosed and classified according to Porto criteria and Paris classification, respectively. Physician global assessment, pediatric Crohn's disease and pediatric ulcerative colitis activity indexes and fecal calprotectin were used to define disease activation. RESULTS: A total of 34 pediatric patients with Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and 29 controls were enrolled in the study. Neutrophil volume distribution width (NVDW) was significantly higher in patients with IBD compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001). An increased NVDW level was observed in IBD patients in activation (22.42 +/- 2.13) compared to those in remission (19.22 +/- 1.63) (P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between IBD patients in remission and healthy controls. The best cutoff of NVDW for prediction of disease activation in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in this series was 20.39 with a sensitivity of 90.9% and a specificity of 75% (AUC: 0.852 CI: 0.698-1.000 P < 0.001) and 19.74 with a sensitivity of 92.9% and a specificity of 90.9% (AUC: 0.961, CI: 0.889-1.000, P < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: As a quantitative, objective, and sensitive parameter, we believe that the NVDW has a potential to be an additional test detecting disease activation in IBD.},

Secondary amyloidosis is rarely caused by inflammatory bowel diseases. Secondary amyloidosis is relatively more common in the patients with Crohn's disease, whereas it is highly rare in patients with ulcerative colitis. Diffuse amyloid goiter caused by ulcerative colitis is also a rare condition. In the presence of amyloid in the thyroid gland, medullary thyroid cancer should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis. Imaging techniques and biochemical tests are not very helpful in the diagnosis of secondary amyloid goiter and the definitive diagnosis is established based on the histopathologic analysis and histochemical staining techniques. In this report, we present a 35-year-old male patient with diffuse amyloid goiter caused by secondary amyloidosis associated with ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To determine the bone status in children with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) using quantitative ultrasound (QUS) measurement at hand phalanges and compare the obtained results with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). METHODS: Fifty-one children with IBD underwent DXA and QUS measurements at hand phalanges in the year 2013. The control group for the QUS consisted of 460 children. Reference data for DXA comes from Hologic Explorer. RESULTS: QUS measurements did not differ significantly between IBD patients and healthy controls. There was no difference between UC and CD subjects. DXA measurements in patients with IBD were lower than in the healthy population. Tanner stage and nutritional status correlated with bone status contrary to steroids therapy. CONCLUSION: Low bone mineral density often complicates IBD in children. QUS is not an appropriate method for the assessment of bone status in children. Nutritional status seems to have a greater impact on bone status than corticosteroids therapy.},

The aim of the present study was to determine the prognostic factors for early colectomy. A total of 85 hospitalized patients with UC (CSA, 50 patients; FK506, 35 patients) were enrolled. Colectomy carried out within 60 days of starting CNI therapy was defined as 'early colectomy'. To assess the prognostic factors affecting early colectomy, clinical practical variables, including the Onodera-prognostic nutritional index (O-PNI): 10xAlb+0.005x (total lymphocyte count), were analyzed. The results demonstrated that the significant factors predicting early colectomy were i) disease severity, ii) immunomodulator-naive history, iii) lower serum hematocrit, iv) lower serum albumin and v) lower O-PNI. In addition, the significant factors predicting overall colectomy were as follows: i) C7-HRP positivity and ii) >10,000 mg of prednisolone used prior to the initiation of CNI treatment. The combination of hematocrit and O-PNI enhanced the prediction of early colectomy. Clinical variables such as hematocrit and O-PNI were the significant factors predicting colectomy. These results may be used as a guide to predict the outcome of patients with UC in clinical settings.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two major forms of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Vitamin A (VA) and vitamin D (VD) may be associated with reduction in inflammation in these disorders. The aim of this review was to show the current evidence that may associate VA and VD with IBDs. Data linking VA, VD, and IBDs were studied. Both VA and VD may be related to the immune system in different manners. The active form of VA, retinoic acid, may be related to the growth factor-beta and release of interleukin-10 (IL-10), thus involved with the resolution of the inflammation. Its deficiency is associated with the increase of disease activity. The active form of VD is 1,25(OH)2D3 that produces biological effects via the nuclear hormone receptor named VD receptor (VDR), which may interfere with the immune cells and macrophages leading to the suppression of the inflammatory process by decreasing the release of TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8, IL-12, and IL-23. VDR may also activate nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 expression and stimulate the production of the defensin and cathelicidin that are important to the homeostasis of the mucosal immune barrier. The use of VA and VD could be helpful in the treatment and prevention of IBDs but more studies are necessary to establish the precise role of these compounds in the prevention or remission of these inflammatory processes.},

   abstract = {Adjuvants to the traditional therapy of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been studied to enhance the efficacy of the treatment and improve patients' quality of life. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega3FA) have been associated with attenuation of the inflammatory responses in IBD, possibly acting as substrates for anti-inflammatory eicosanoid production, similar to prostaglandins and leukotrienes. omega3FA also act as substrates for the synthesis of resolvins, maresins and protectins, indispensable in resolving inflammation processes. These acids may influence the development or course of IBD by: reducing oxidative stress, production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and proinflammatory cytokines; working as chemopreventive agents; and decreasing the expression of adhesion molecules. There are numerous controversies in the literature on the effects of omega3FA in the prevention or treatment of IBD, but their effects in reducing inflammation is incontestable. Therefore, more studies are warranted to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms and establish the recommended daily intake to prevent or induce remission in IBD patients.},

Meta-analysis of several randomized controlled trials have confirmed benefit for the administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea and to treat acute infectious diarrhea. Individual studies have also suggested benefit of probiotics to prevent acute gastroenteritis and serve as an adjunct in ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, CDI, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic in breastfed babies. Although promising, larger well-designed studies need to confirm these findings. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental factors are an integral component in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is an increasing interest in nutritive components. While the potential disease-modifying role of coffee has been intensively investigated in a variety of gastrointestinal diseases, the data on the potential impact on IBD is very limited. We aimed to determine the patients' perspective on coffee consumption in IBD. METHODS: We conducted a questionnaire among IBD patients in Switzerland, assessing key questions regarding coffee consumption. Descriptive statistics including chi square testing were used for analysis of questionnaire data. RESULTS: Among a total of 442 patients 73% regularly consume coffee. 96% of patients attributing a positive and 91% of patients attributing no impact of coffee intake on IBD regularly drink coffee and surprisingly even 49% of those patients that assign a negative impact on disease symptoms. Among those patients refraining from regular coffee intake 62% are convinced that coffee adversely influences intestinal symptoms, significantly more in Crohn's disease (CD) than in ulcerative colitis (UC) (76% vs. 44%, p = 0.002). In total, 38% of all study subjects suppose that coffee has an effect on their symptoms of disease, significantly more in CD (54%) compared to UC patients (22%, p < 0.001). Moreover, while 45% of CD patients feel that coffee has a detrimental influence, only 20% of UC patients share this impression (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Two thirds of IBD patients regularly consume coffee. More than twice as many CD compared to UC patients attribute a symptom-modifying effect of coffee consumption, the majority a detrimental one. However, this negative perception does not result in abstinence from coffee consumption.},

Previously reported neurological complications include central and peripheral demyelinating disorders and neuropathies occurring months into therapy. PATIENT DESCRIPTION: A seven-year-old boy diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis received infliximab. Six hours following his uneventful infusion, he awoke with headache and emesis and rapidly became obtunded. Neurological examination revealed minimally reactive pupils and otherwise absent brainstem reflexes. Cranial computed tomography revealed hypodense lesions in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and pons accompanied by hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging showed diffusion restriction concerning for ischemia with areas of ring enhancement suggestive of inflammation. Vessel imaging was normal, and cerebrospinal fluid and serum studies showed only an extremely elevated level of d-dimer. Echocardiogram showed depressed ventricular function but neither intracardiac shunt nor thrombus. Within four days he met criteria for brain death. Autopsy was refused. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a fulminant, fatal central nervous system process to occur after an initial dose of infliximab. The differential diagnosis includes multifocal arterial strokes and a devastating demyelinating process.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Canada has amongst the highest incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the world, and the highest proportion of immigrants among G8 nations. We determined differences in prediagnosis delay, specialist care, health services use, and risk of surgery in immigrants with IBD. METHODS: All incident cases of IBD in children (1994-2009) and adults (1999-2009) were identified from population-based health administrative data in Ontario, Canada. Linked immigration data identified those who arrived to Ontario after 1985. We compared time to diagnosis, postdiagnosis health services use (IBD specific and related), physician specialist care in immigrants and nonimmigrants, and risk of surgery between immigrants and nonimmigrants. RESULTS: Thousand two hundred two immigrants were compared with 22,990 nonimmigrants. Immigrants had similar time to diagnosis as nonimmigrants for Crohn's (hazard ratio [HR] 1.002; 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 0.89-1.12) and ulcerative colitis (HR 1.073; 95% CI 0.95-1.21). For outpatient visits, immigrants with IBD were seen by gastroenterologists more often than nonimmigrants. Immigrants had greater IBD-specific outpatient health services use after diagnosis (odds ratio 1.24; 95% CI 1.15-1.33), emergency department visits (odds ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.30-1.91), and hospitalizations (odds ratio 1.19; 95% CI 1.02-1.40). In immigrants, there was lower risk of surgery for Crohn's (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43-0.99) and ulcerative colitis (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31-0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Immigrants to Canada had greater outpatient and specialty care and lower risk of surgery, with no delay in diagnosis, indicating appropriate use of the health system.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease [VEO-IBD] is a form of IBD that is distinct from that of children with an older onset. We compared changes over time in the incidence and phenotype at diagnosis between two groups according to age at IBD diagnosis: VEO-IBD diagnosed before the age of 6 years, and early-onset IBD [EO-IBD] diagnosed between 6 and 16 years of age. METHODS: Data were obtained from a cohort enrolled in a prospective French population-based registry from 1988 to 2011. RESULTS: Among the 1412 paediatric cases [< 17 years], 42 [3%] were VEO-IBD. In the VEO-IBD group, the incidence remained stable over the study period. In contrast, the incidence of EO-IBD increased from 4.4/105 in 1988-1990 to 9.5/105 in 2009-2011 [+116%; p < 10-4]. Crohn's disease [CD] was the most common IBD, regardless of age, but ulcerative colitis [UC] and unclassified IBD were more common in VEO-IBD cases [40% vs 26%; p = 0.04]. VEO-IBD diagnosis was most often performed in hospital [69% vs 43%; p < 10-3]. Rectal bleeding and mucous stools were more common in patients with VEO-IBD, whereas weight loss and abdominal pain were more frequent in those with EO-IBD. Regarding CD, isolated colonic disease was more common in the VEO-IBD group [39% vs 14%; p = 0.003]. CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based cohort, the incidence of VEO-IBD was low and stable from 1988 to 2011, with a specific clinical presentation. These results suggest a probable genetic origin for VEO-IBD, whereas the increase in EO-IBD might be linked to environmental factors.},

   abstract = {Although all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is a key regulator of intestinal immunity, its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. We found that mice with colitis-associated CRC had a marked deficiency in colonic atRA due to alterations in atRA metabolism mediated by microbiota-induced intestinal inflammation. Human ulcerative colitis (UC), UC-associated CRC, and sporadic CRC specimens have similar alterations in atRA metabolic enzymes, consistent with reduced colonic atRA. Inhibition of atRA signaling promoted tumorigenesis, whereas atRA supplementation reduced tumor burden. The benefit of atRA treatment was mediated by cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells, which were activated due to MHCI upregulation on tumor cells. Consistent with these findings, increased colonic expression of the atRA-catabolizing enzyme, CYP26A1, correlated with reduced frequencies of tumoral cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells and with worse disease prognosis in human CRC. These results reveal a mechanism by which microbiota drive colon carcinogenesis and highlight atRA metabolism as a therapeutic target for CRC.},

Over the last four years, less than seventy cases of IgG-associated pouchitis have been reported from a pouchitis clinic in Cleveland. METHODS: We report the first two cases of IgG4-associated pouchitis from our inflammatory bowel disease clinic and outside of Cleveland. CONCLUSION: This highlights the fact that this entity could be more common than we think. It is important for general gastroenterologists to think about IgG4-mediated disease if the patient has refractory pouchitis, so early diagnosis and referral can be made. This would avoid the cost of expensive therapy and minimize antibiotic use which is what happened in our cases prior to this diagnosis being made.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: No study to date has evaluated perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease-unclassified (IBDU) as compared with Crohn's colitis (CC) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which represent the diagnostic challenge. We aimed to explore the diagnostic utility of serology and to assess whether serology can predict disease severity in these subgroups. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective longitudinal study including 406 children with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) from 23 centers affiliated with the Porto group of European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (mean age 10.5 +/- 3.9, 54% males); 117 (29%) with CC, 143 (35%) with UC, and 146 (36%) with IBDU. Median follow-up period was 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.6-4.2). RESULTS: The most prevalent serologic profile in IBDU was pANCA-/ASCA- (41%), followed by pANCA+/ASCA- (34%) and pANCA-/ASCA+ (17%). pANCA-/ASCA+ differentiated well between CC versus IBDU (83% specificity, 96% positive predictive value [PPV]) and UC (97% specificity, 90% PPV) patients, albeit with a low negative predictive value (13% and 40%, respectively). pANCA+/ASCA- did not differentiate as well between IBD subgroups, but UC children with pANCA+/ASCA- had more often severe disease at diagnosis (36 [62%] versus 22 [38%], P = 0.033) and needed more often calcineurin inhibitors, biologics, or colectomy (25 [80%] versus 6 [20%], P = 0.026). In CC, double positivity for ASCA and not pANCA-/ASCA+ profile was associated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Serology may have some role in predicting disease course and outcomes in colonic IBD, but its routine use needs to be supported by more studies. Serology cannot routinely be recommended for differentiating between IBDU versus CC or UC as a sole diagnostic criterion given its low diagnostic utility.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been reported to have putative health effects including the prevention of inflammation and obesity. Historically, polyphenols have been regarded as antinutritionals and while such effects may be beneficial in obese subjects, they may be deleterious in nutritionally compromised individuals. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the effect of EGCG in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated mouse model of ulcerative colitis. Following induction of colitis, mice were treated with EGCG (3.2 mg/g) as the sole source of drinking fluid for 3 days. EGCG treatment mitigated DSS-induced colon shortening and spleen enlargement. EGCG also decreased colonic protein levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, as well as colonic lipid peroxides compared to DSS-treated controls. We observed that EGCG reduced DSS-induced gastrointestinal permeability. These beneficial effects were offset by enhanced body weight loss in EGCG-treated mice compared to DSS-treated controls. These effects were related to decreased protein and lipid digestion in EGCG-treated mice compared to DSS-treated controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that although EGCG may exert anti-inflammatory effects, its ability to modulate macronutrient digestion may represent a dose-limiting adverse effect that must be considered in the context of its use for treating inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Monitoring disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is of major importance to prevent long-term complications. Intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) has been identified as a marker for intestinal damage and correlates with the degree of inflammation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether I-FABP can predict active disease or remission in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in a real-life IBD cohort. METHODS: In total, 70 patients with endoscopic disease activity available and 194 patients with disease activity on the basis of a stringent combi-score of clinical activity index, C-reactive protein, and fecal calprotectin were included. Plasma I-FABP was compared between patients with active disease and remission. In a small subgroup of CD patients, follow-up samples were analyzed. RESULTS: In CD (139.2 vs. 119.2 pg/ml; P=0.37) and UC (107.8 vs. 151.8 pg/ml; P=0.33), the median I-FABP did not differ in endoscopic active disease versus remission. In UC patients with active disease on the basis of the combi-score, the median I-FABP (106.8 vs. 172.0 pg/ml; P=0.03) was significantly lower than in patients in remission, but not in CD (145.5 vs. 157.5 pg/ml; P=0.29). Neither disease location in CD nor extent of disease in UC influenced I-FABP significantly. I-FABP was not different (P=0.78) in CD patients with a change in disease activity over time. CONCLUSION: Plasma I-FABP did not differ between endoscopic active disease and remission in both CD and UC. I-FABP was lower in active UC but not CD on the basis of the combi-score. On the basis of these findings, I-FABP has no potential as a novel noninvasive biomarker for disease activity in IBD.},

   abstract = {In ulcerative colitis (UC) the butyrate metabolism is impaired, leading to energy-deficiency in the colonic cells. The effect of inflammation on the butyrate metabolism was investigated. HT-29 cells were incubated with pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and/or IFN-gamma) for 1 and 24 h. Cells were additionally stimulated with butyrate to investigate its anti-inflammatory potential. Butyrate uptake and oxidation were measured using (14)C-labeled butyrate. Gene expression of the butyrate metabolism enzymes, interleukin 8 (IL-8; inflammatory marker) and villin-1 (VIL-1; epithelial cell damage marker) was measured via quantitative RT-PCR. Significantly increased IL-8 expression and decreased VIL-1 expression after 24 h incubation with TNF-alpha and/or IFN-gamma confirmed the presence of inflammation. These conditions induced a decrease of both butyrate uptake and oxidation, whereas the gene expression was not reduced. Simultaneous incubation with butyrate counteracted the reduced butyrate oxidation. In contrast, 1 h incubation with TNF-alpha induced a significant increased IL-8 expression and decreased butyrate uptake. Incubation with TNF-alpha and/or IFN-gamma for 1 h did not induce cell damage nor influence butyrate oxidation. The inflammation-induced downregulation of the butyrate metabolism was not caused by a reduced gene expression, but appeared consequential to a decreased butyrate uptake. Increasing the luminal butyrate levels might have therapeutic potential in UC.},

The study included 52 children with IBD (24 with Crohn's disease and 28 with ulcerative colitis) aged between 0.92 and 18 years, and 41 IBD-free controls of similar age. Fecal concentration of lactoferrin was determined with a quantitative immunoenzymatic test. Fecal concentration of lactoferrin in children with IBD was significantly higher than in the controls. The cut-off value of fecal lactoferrin concentration optimally distinguishing between the children with IBD and the controls was identified as 13 mug/g. The sensitivity and specificity of this cut-off value equaled 80.7% and 92.7%, respectively, and its positive and negative prognostic values were 96.8% and 63.3%, respectively. Patients diagnosed with moderate Crohn's disease had significantly higher fecal concentrations of lactoferrin than children with the mild or inactive disease. Similarly, children with moderate ulcerative colitis showed significantly higher fecal concentrations of lactoferrin than individuals with the mild condition. No significant relationship was found between the fecal concentration of lactoferrin and the severity of endoscopic lesions. Patients with IBD and a positive result of fecal occult blood test were characterized by significantly higher concentrations of lactoferrin than the individuals with IBD and a negative result of this test. In conclusion, fecal concentration of lactoferrin seems to be a useful parameter for diagnosis and monitoring of IBD in children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Immune tolerance breakdown during UC involves the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), a key factor in mucosal homoeostasis and the therapeutic target of 5-aminosalycilates, which expression is impaired during UC. Here we assess the impact of glucocorticoids (GCs) on PPARgamma expression, focusing especially on extra-adrenal cortisol production by colonic epithelial cells (CECs). METHODS: Activation of PPARgamma in the colon was evaluated using transgenic mice for the luciferase gene under PPAR control (peroxisome proliferator response element-luciferase mice). Protein and mRNA expression of PPARgamma were evaluated with colon fragments and purified CEC from mice. Cortisol production and steroidogenic factor expression were quantified in human CEC of patients with UC and those of controls. Gene expression knockdown by short hairpin RNA in Caco-2 cells was used for functional studies. RESULTS: GCs were able to raise luciferase activity in peroxisome proliferator response element-luciferase mice. In the mice colons and Caco-2 cells, PPARgamma expression was increased either with GCs or with an inducer of steroidogenesis and then decreased after treatment with a steroidogenesis inhibitor. Cortisol production and steroidogenic factor expression, such as liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1), were decreased in CEC isolated from patients with UC, directly correlating with PPARgamma impairment. Experiments on Caco-2 cells lacking LRH-1 expression confirmed that LRH-1 controls PPARgamma expression by regulating GC synthesis in CEC. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate cortisol control of PPARgamma expression in CEC, highlighting cortisol production deficiency in colonocytes as a key molecular event in the pathophysiology of UC.},

A distinct inflammatory bowel disease phenotype has been suggested in adults and in small pediatric cohorts. The aim of the study was to evaluate the features of inflammatory bowel disease associated with autoimmune liver diseases and to analyze the characteristics of the liver disease. METHODS: Information on patients was obtained from the Italian Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Registry. Data of patients with and without autoimmune liver disease were compared. RESULTS: Autoimmune liver disease was detected in 6.8% of the 677 patients enrolled and was significantly associated with the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (83%), with pancolonic involvement (84%), and with perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positivity (41%) (all Ps < 0.05). Autoimmune liver disease was defined as sclerosing cholangitis in 61% of the patients and as an overlap syndrome in 33%. Concomitant intra- and extrahepatic biliary involvement was reported in 61% of cases, whereas exclusive extrahepatic lesions were reported in 21%. Hepatobiliary complications were observed in 9% of the patients during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Autoimmune liver disease, especially sclerosing cholangitis, was significantly more common in patients with extensive ulcerative colitis. Although complications are relatively rare in the pediatric age, monitoring is recommended.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) cause significant morbidity and are increasing in prevalence among all populations, including African Americans. More than 200 susceptibility loci have been identified in populations of predominantly European ancestry, but few loci have been associated with IBD in other ethnicities. METHODS: We performed 2 high-density, genome-wide scans comprising 2345 cases of African Americans with IBD (1646 with CD, 583 with UC, and 116 inflammatory bowel disease unclassified) and 5002 individuals without IBD (controls, identified from the Health Retirement Study and Kaiser Permanente database). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated at P < 5.0 x 10-8 in meta-analysis with a nominal evidence (P < .05) in each scan were considered to have genome-wide significance. RESULTS: We detected SNPs at HLA-DRB1, and African-specific SNPs at ZNF649 and LSAMP, with associations of genome-wide significance for UC. We detected SNPs at USP25 with associations of genome-wide significance for IBD. No associations of genome-wide significance were detected for CD. In addition, 9 genes previously associated with IBD contained SNPs with significant evidence for replication (P < 1.6 x 10-6): ADCY3, CXCR6, HLA-DRB1 to HLA-DQA1 (genome-wide significance on conditioning), IL12B,PTGER4, and TNC for IBD; IL23R, PTGER4, and SNX20 (in strong linkage disequilibrium with NOD2) for CD; and KCNQ2 (near TNFRSF6B) for UC. Several of these genes, such as TNC (near TNFSF15), CXCR6, and genes associated with IBD at the HLA locus, contained SNPs with unique association patterns with African-specific alleles. CONCLUSIONS: We performed a genome-wide association study of African Americans with IBD and identified loci associated with UC in only this population; we also replicated IBD, CD, and UC loci identified in European populations. The detection of variants associated with IBD risk in only people of African descent demonstrates the importance of studying the genetics of IBD and other complex diseases in populations beyond those of European ancestry.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Assessment of disease activity in UC is important for designing an optimal therapeutic strategy. No single histology score is considered optimum. The aim of this study was to compare intraobserver reproducibility and the interobserver agreement of available histological UC activity indexes. METHODS: One hundred and two biopsy specimens (collected between 2003 and 2014) were scored blindly by three pathologists by determining Geboes, Riley, Gramlich and Gupta indexes and global visual evaluation (GVE). Intraobserver reproducibility and interobserver agreements for index and items of index were studied by intraclass correlation coefficient for quantitative parameter and by kappa values and Krippendorff index for qualitative parameters. Relationship between indexes was studied by computation of Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Geboes, Riley, Gramlich and Gupta indexes and GVE showed good intraobserver reproducibility and a good interobserver agreement. Histological items that showed the best interobserver agreement were 'erosion/ulceration or surface epithelial integrity' and 'acute inflammatory cells infiltrate/neutrophils in lamina propria'. The five scores were strongly correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Correlation between indexes is strong. Intraobserver reproducibility and interobserver agreement for all indexes is very good. Histological items that showed the best interobserver agreement are 'erosion/ulceration' and 'acute inflammatory cells infiltrate/neutrophils in lamina propria'.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) is a potent amplifier of inflammation. Recently, the antimicrobial peptide PGLYRP-1 was shown to be the ligand of TREM-1. Here, the ability of an anti-TREM-1 antibody to dampen the release of proinflammatory cytokines by colon lamina propria cells (LPCs) from patients with IBD was investigated and correlated with PGLYRP-1 levels. METHODS: Biopsies from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 45) or Crohn's disease (CD, n = 26) were compared with those from individuals undergoing colonoscopy for other reasons (n = 17). TREM-1 expression was analyzed on myeloid cells by flow cytometry. Cell culture experiments with LPCs were used to analyze PGLYRP-1 and inflammatory cytokine levels and assess the effect of anti-TREM-1 on cytokine secretion. RESULTS: The frequency of TREM-1-expressing neutrophils and recruited macrophages was higher in inflamed than in noninflamed biopsies. The PGLYRP-1 level in inflamed tissue was higher than in noninflamed tissue; it was produced primarily by neutrophils, and its level correlated with the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Secretion of myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-8 by LPCs stimulated with the potent TREM-1 agonist consisting of PGLYRP-1 complexed with peptidoglycan was reduced in the presence of anti-TREM-1. Moreover, a blocking effect of anti-TREM-1 was apparent when LPCs from a subset of inflamed individuals with elevated PGLYRP-1 were stimulated with killed bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: An anti-TREM-1 antibody can dampen secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in inflamed patients with elevated PGLYRP-1. Moreover, PGLYRP-1 + myeloperoxidase is a potential biomarker for predicting the effect of anti-TREM-1 therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can arise at any age, with peak incidence in adolescence and young adulthood. A registry of pediatric cases of IBD offers the opportunity to document their diagnosis and treatment, with the ultimate aim of improving diagnosis and treatment in the future. METHODS: In the German-language CEDATA-GPGE registry, 3991 cases of IBD in patients less than 18 years of age were documented from 2004 to 2014. The 1257 patients who were prospectively included in the registry upon diagnosis and whose further course was documented for at least three months were analyzed in two separate groups--under 10 years old, and 10 years and above--with respect to the type and duration of their symptoms until diagnosis, the completeness of the diagnostic evaluation, the disease phenotype, and the initial treatment. RESULTS: Of the 958 patients for whom full documentation was available, 616 (64.3%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 278 (29%) had ulcerative colitis (UC), 64 (6.7%) had an unclassified IBD, and 23.2% were under 10 years old. The latency to diagnosis was longer for CD than for UC (0.5 versus 0.3 years), regardless of age. 62.5% of the CD patients had ileocolonic involvement, and more than half had involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract. 71% of the patients with UC had subtotal colitis or pancolitis. Continuous improvement was seen in diagnostic assessment according to published guidelines. For example, in 2004/2005, 69% of patients were evaluated endoscopically with ileocolonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy; this fraction had risen to nearly 100% by 2013/2014. Similarly, the percentage of patients who underwent a diagnostic evaluation of the small intestine, as recommended, rose from 41.2% to 60.9% over the same period. The most common initial treatments were 5- amino - salicylates (86.8% CD, 100% UC) and glucocorticoids (60.6% CD, 65.6% UC). 32% of the patients with CD received exclusive enteral nutrition therapy. CONCLUSION: Most of these pediatric patients with IBD, whether in the younger or the older age group, had extensive bowel involvement at the time of diagnosis. The registry data imply that improvement in clinical course may be achieved by shortening the time to diagnosis and by closer adherence to the diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines.},

Environmental factors such as dietary patterns may increase symptoms in UC patients. AIM: To validate and implement a questionnaire to identify foods that exacerbates symptoms in UC patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted to validate and to assess the relationship of food and symptoms in Mexican UC patients. RESULTS: The IVC obtained was 0.56 in the questionnaire and kappa = 0.03 in foods from animal origin, 0.5 cereals and tubers, 0.2 legumes, 0.4 vegetables and fruits, 0.4 fats and 0.3 in others. The evaluation was carried out in UC patients (n = 233), 65% active and 35% in UC remission, the current age was 45 (SD; 15) years in active UC and 40 (SD; 15) years in UC remission. Three food groups were made based on the frequency of symptoms: Group A; symptoms more often, especially the active vs remission (P <0.05); Group B caused more symptoms in remission UC vs active UC (P = 0.07) and Group C caused more symptoms in the active UC (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Foods with higher frequency of symptoms in patients with UC were: beans, whole milk, plum, lima beans and spicy sauce.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Biological agents are being increasingly used in the UK for paediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) despite limited evidence and safety concerns. We evaluated effectiveness and safety in the clinical setting, highlighting drug cost pressures, using our national Scottish PIBD biological registry. METHODS: Complete usage of the biological agents, infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) for treatment of PIBD (in those aged <18 years) from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2010 was collated from all treatments administered within the Scottish Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (PGHAN) national managed service network (all regional PGHAN centres and paediatric units within their associated district general hospitals). RESULTS: 132 children had biological therapy; 24 required both agents; 114 had Crohn's disease (CD), 16 had ulcerative colitis (UC) and 2 had IBD Unclassified (IBDU). 127 children received IFX to induce remission; 61 entered remission, 49 had partial response and 17 had no response. 72 were given maintenance IFX and 23 required dose escalation. 18 had infusion reactions and 27 had adverse events (infections/other adverse events). 29 had ADA to induce remission (28 CD and 1 UC), 24 after IFX; 10 entered remission, 12 had partial response and 7 had no response. All had maintenance; 19 required dose escalation. 12 children overall required hospitalisation due to drug toxicity. No deaths occurred with either IFX or ADA. CONCLUSIONS: Complete accrual of the Scottish nationwide 'real-life' experience demonstrates moderate effectiveness of anti tumour necrosis factor agents in severe PIBD but duration of effect is limited; significant financial issues (drug cost-need for dose escalation and/or multiple biological usage) and safety issues exist.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Parenteral methotrexate is an effective treatment for patients with Crohn's disease, but has never been adequately evaluated in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine its safety and efficacy in patients with steroid-dependent UC. METHODS: We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of parenteral methotrexate (25 mg/wk) in 111 patients with corticosteroid-dependent UC at 26 medical centers in Europe from 2007 through 2013. Patients were given prednisone (10 to 40 mg/d) when the study began and were randomly assigned to groups (1:1) given placebo or methotrexate (intramuscularly or subcutaneously, 25 mg weekly) for 24 weeks. The primary end point was steroid-free remission (defined as a Mayo score </=2 with no item >1 and complete withdrawal of steroids) at week 16. Secondary endpoints included clinical remission (defined as a Mayo clinical subscore </=2 with no item >1) and endoscopic healing without steroids at weeks 16 and/or 24, remission without steroids at week 24, and remission at both weeks 16 and 24. RESULTS: Steroid-free remission at week 16 was achieved by 19 of 60 patients given methotrexate (31.7%) and 10 of 51 patients given placebo (19.6%)--a difference of 12.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.0% to 28.1%; P = .15). The proportion of patients in steroid-free clinical remission at week 16 was 41.7% in the methotrexate group and 23.5% in the placebo group, for a difference of 18.1% (95% CI: 1.1% to 35.2%; P = .04). The proportions of patients with steroid-free endoscopic healing at week 16 were 35% in the methotrexate group and 25.5% in the placebo group--a difference of 9.5% (95% CI: -7.5% to 26.5%; P = .28). No differences were observed in other secondary end points. More patients receiving placebo discontinued the study because of adverse events (47.1%), mostly caused by UC, than patients receiving methotrexate (26.7%; P = .03). A higher proportion of patients in the methotrexate group had nausea and vomiting (21.7%) than in the placebo group (3.9%; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized controlled trial, parenteral methotrexate was not superior to placebo for induction of steroid-free remission in patients with UC. However, methotrexate induced clinical remission without steroids in a significantly larger percentage of patients, resulting in fewer withdrawals from therapy due to active UC.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prebiotic dietary fibers resist digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract and allow for stimulation of bacteria in the distal intestine and colon. Stimulation of bacteria among different individuals varies greatly, depending on a wide range of variables. OBJECTIVE: To determine the range of differences in response between individuals, a preclinical in vitro fermentation was conducted with six fecal donors. The primary objective was to compare the fecal microbiota of six individuals at baseline, 12 h and 24 h post-exposure to partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG). METHOD: Fecal donations were collected from six healthy individuals consuming a non-specific Western diet, free of antibiotic treatments in the past year, not affected by any GI diseases and not consuming any probiotic or prebiotic supplements. Fecal samples were exposed to 0.5 g of PHGG and measured for bacterial changes at 0, 12 and 24 h based on 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Parabacteroides increased from 3.48% of sequence reads to 10.62% of sequence reads after 24 h (p = 0.0181) and Bacteroidetes increased from 45.89% of sequence reads to 50.29% of sequence reads (p = 0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: PHGG stimulates growth of Parabacteroides, a genus of bacteria that have been inversely associated with IBS and ulcerative colitis. PHGG provides stimulation of beneficial Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides and Parabacteroides), which may be correlated with many positive health markers and outcomes. PHGG is a prebiotic dietary fiber that is readily fermentable.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) incidence is increasing among low-risk populations. This study examined a cohort of Canadian South Asian (SA) children with IBD to determine if their disease course differed from non-SA (NSA) children. METHODS: Children of SA ethnicity diagnosed with IBD between 1997 and 2012 were identified and compared with NSA children. Data on duration and the type of presenting symptoms, disease phenotype, corticosteroid exposure (CS), exclusive enteral nutrition use, time to commencement of immunomodulator (IM), biologic therapy, and surgical intervention were extracted. RESULTS: Overall, 160 SA children were identified and compared with 783 NSA patients (Crohn's disease [CD]: 44% versus 72%; ulcerative colitis [UC]: 43% versus 21%; IBD-Unclassified: 13% versus 7%; P < 0.001). SA patients were predominantly second-generation Canadians (92%) and had shorter symptom duration (2 versus 4 months; P < 0.001). SA CD patients were less likely to have a parent with IBD (1% versus 14%; P = 0.003). SA patients had more extensive colonic disease (CD: 55% versus 35%; P = 0.005; UC: 77% versus 58%; P = 0.006); SA CD patients presented with more complicated disease (B2/B3: 39% versus 27%; P = 0.006) and UC patients presented with more severe disease (49% versus 23%; P < 0.001). In SA CD patients, CS use was higher (70% versus 58%; P = 0.045), and IM and biologic therapy were commenced earlier (P = 0.027; P = 0.047). SA UC patients were more likely to need CS and IM (P = 0.024; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data describe an ethnically unique clinical phenotype, where SA children have a higher proportion of UC, shorter symptom duration, more extensive colonic disease, and are more likely to require earlier escalation of therapy.},

The antioxidant mineral selenium (Se) was measured in serum samples from 106 IBD patients (53 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 53 with Crohn's disease (CD)) and from 30 healthy controls. Serum Se concentrations were significantly lower in UC and CD patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001) and significantly lower in CD patients than in UC patients (p = 0.006). Se concentrations in patients were significantly influenced by sex, body mass index (BMI), the inflammatory biomarker alpha-1-antitrypsin, surgery, medical treatment, the severity, extent, and form of the disease and the length of time since onset (p < 0.05). Se concentrations in IBD patients were positively and linearly correlated with nutritional (protein, albumin, prealbumin, cholinesterase and total cholesterol) and iron status-related (hemoglobin, Fe and hematocrit) parameters (p < 0.05). A greater impairment of serum Se and cardiovascular status was observed in CD than in UC patients. An adequate nutritional Se status is important in IBD patients to minimize the cardiovascular risk associated with increased inflammation biomarkers, especially in undernourished CD patients, and is also related to an improved nutritional and body iron status.},

   abstract = {Emerging data have highlighted the co-existence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and inflammatory bowel disease; both of which are increasingly prevalent disorders with significant complications and impact on future health burden. Cross-section observational studies have shown widely variable prevalence rates of co-existing disease, largely due to differences in disease definition and diagnostic tools utilised in the studies. Age, obesity, insulin resistance and other metabolic conditions are common risks factors in observational studies. However, other studies have also suggested a more dominant role of inflammatory bowel disease related factors such as disease activity, duration, steroid use and prior surgical intervention, in the development of NAFLD. This suggests a potentially more complex pathogenesis and relationship between the two diseases which may be contributed by factors including altered intestinal permeability, gut dysbiosis and chronic inflammatory response. Commonly used immunomodulation agents pose potential hepatic toxicity, however no definitive evidence exist linking them to the development of hepatic steatosis, nor are there any data on the impact of therapy and prognosis in patient with co-existent diseases. Further studies are required to assess the impact and establish appropriate screening and management strategies in order to allow early identification, intervention and improve patient outcomes.},

Despite advances in understanding the genetic risks of IBD, associated single nucleotide polymorphisms have low penetrance, monozygotic twin studies suggest a low concordance rate, and increasing worldwide IBD incidence leave gaps in our understanding of IBD heritability and highlight the importance of environmental influences. Operating at the interface between environment and heritable molecular and cellular phenotypes, microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Studies to date have identified unique miRNA expression profile signatures in IBD and preliminary functional analyses associate these deregulated miRNAs to canonical pathways associated with IBD pathogenesis. In this review, we summarize and discuss the miRNA expression signatures associated with IBD in tissue and peripheral blood, highlight miRNAs with potential future clinical applications as diagnostic and therapeutic targets, and provide an outlook on how to develop miRNA based therapies.},

This study aimed to systematically review all published clinical trials evaluating the effects of a regular diet on symptoms of IBD. Three medical databases were searched for clinical trials evaluating an intervention that involved dietary manipulation using a regular diet on adults with IBD whose symptoms were objectively measured before and after the intervention. The most common types of regular diet interventions that we observed in the literature fell into the following three categories: low residue/low fiber diets, exclusion diets, or other specific diets. Of all included studies, the few that were of higher quality and that observed a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in the diet group compared to the control group fell under the exclusion diet group or the other specific diet group. We were able to identify several high quality clinical trials evaluating dietary manipulations on symptoms of IBD. Exclusion diets and the low FODMAP diet are two areas identified in this review that show promise for having therapeutic benefits for patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves dysregulation of mucosal immunity in response to environmental factors such as the gut microbiota. The bacterial microbiota is often altered in IBD, but the connection to disease is not fully clarified and gut fungi have recently been suggested to play a role as well. In this study, we compared microbes from all 3 domains of life-bacteria, archaea, and eukaryota-in pediatric patients with IBD and healthy controls. METHODS: A stool sample was collected from patients with IBD (n = 32) or healthy control subjects (n = 90), and bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities were characterized by deep sequencing of rRNA gene segments specific to each domain. RESULTS: Patients with IBD (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) had lower bacterial diversity and distinctive fungal communities. Two lineages annotating as Candida were significantly more abundant in patients with IBD (P = 0.0034 and P = 0.00038, respectively), whereas a lineage annotating as Cladosporium was more abundant in healthy subjects (P = 0.0025). There were no statistically significant differences in archaea, which were rare in pediatric samples compared with those from adults. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric IBD is associated with reduced diversity in both fungal and bacterial gut microbiota. Specific Candida taxa were found to be increased in abundance in the IBD samples. These data emphasize the potential importance of fungal microbiota signatures as biomarkers of pediatric IBD, supporting their possible role in disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for refractoryClostridium difficileinfections. However, concerns persist about unwanted cotransfer of pathogenic microbes such as viruses. Here we studed FMT from a single healthy human donor to three pediatric ulcerative colitis patients, each of whom received a course of 22 to 30 FMT treatments. Viral particles were purified from donor and recipient stool samples and sequenced; the reads were then assembled into contigs corresponding to viral genomes or partial genomes. Transfer of selected viruses was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Viral contigs present in the donor could be readily detected in recipients, with up to 32 different donor viral contigs appearing in a recipient sample. Reassuringly, none of these were viruses are known to replicate on human cells. Instead, viral contigs either scored as bacteriophage or could not be attributed taxonomically, suggestive of unstudied phage. The two most frequently transferred gene types were associated with temperate-phage replication. In addition, members ofSiphoviridae, the group of typically temperate phages that includes phage lambda, were found to be transferred with significantly greater efficiency than other groups. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the temperate-phage replication style may promote efficient phage transfer between human individuals. In summary, we documented transfer of multiple viral lineages between human individuals through FMT, but in this case series, none were from viral groups known to infect human cells. IMPORTANCE: Transfer of whole communities of viruses between humans has rarely been studied but is of likely medical importance. Here we studied fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a highly successful treatment for relapsingClostridium difficileinfection and, potentially, other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. We investigated the transfer of viral communities during FMT and documented transfer of multiple viral lineages between humans. None of these were viruses that replicated on animal cells or that are known to be pathogenic. We found that temperate bacteriophage, which form stable associations with their hosts, were significantly more likely to be transferred during FMT. This supports a model in which the viral temperate replication style may have evolved in part to support efficient viral transmission between environments.},

   abstract = {Prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs) control cellular adaptation to hypoxia. PHDs are found involved in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, the exact role of PHD3, a member of the PHD family, in IBD remains unknown. We show here that PHD3 plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier function. We found that genetic ablation of Phd3 in intestinal epithelial cells led to spontaneous colitis in mice. Deletion of PHD3 decreases the level of tight junction protein occludin, leading to a failure of intestinal epithelial barrier function. Further studies indicate that PHD3 stabilizes occludin by preventing the interaction between the E3 ligase Itch and occludin, in a hydroxylase-independent manner. Examination of biopsy of human ulcerative colitis patients indicates that PHD3 is decreased with disease severity, indicating that PHD3 down-regulation is associated with progression of this disease. We show that PHD3 protects intestinal epithelial barrier function and reveal a hydroxylase-independent function of PHD3 in stabilizing occludin. These findings may help open avenues for developing a therapeutic strategy for IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We aimed to explore the optimal dosing of intravenous-corticosteroids (IVCS) using a robust statistical method on the largest pediatric cohort of acute severe colitis to date. METHODS: Two hundred eighty-three children treated with IVCS for ulcerative colitis were included and studied for 1 year (46% boys, age 12.1 +/- 3.9 years, disease duration 2 (interquartile range [IQR] 0-14) months, baseline Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index 69 +/- 13 points). Confounding by indication was addressed by matching high- and low-IVCS dose patients according to the propensity score method, using 3 cutoffs (1 mg . kg . methylprednisolone to 40 mg . day, 1.25 mg . kg to 50 mg . day and 2 mg . kg to 80 mg . day). RESULTS: The median IVCS dose in the entire cohort was 1.0 mg . kg . day (IQR 0.8-1.4) and 44 mg . kg . day (32-60). Ninety-four of 283 children were matched in the low-dose cutoff (1 mg . kg . day), 218 of 283 were matched in the middle cutoff (1.25 mg . kg . day), and 86/283 in the high dose cutoff (2 mg . kg . day). No differences were found in 25 pretreatment baseline variables in the three cutoffs, implying successful matching. There were no statistical differences in the outcomes of the two lower cutoffs (including need for salvage therapy during admission and by 1 years, admission duration, and day-5 Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index<35 points; all P > 0.05). In the high cutoff, the higher doses were somewhat better but this benefit reversed in a sensitivity analysis excluding one center. High doses were not associated with better outcome also in a propensity score-weighted regression model on the entire cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support present guidelines that doses of IVCS >1 to 1.5 mg . kg . day (maximum 40-60 mg . kg . day) are not justified in acute severe colitis.},

An 11-year-old male patient was hospitalized for recurring upper abdominal pain after meals with vomiting, hematochezia and exertional dyspnea developing at 2 weeks of mesalizine therapy for UC. The serum level of lipase was elevated. Chest X-ray and thorax computed tomography showed interstitial pneumonitis. Mesalizine was discontinued and steroid therapy was initiated. Five days after admission, symptoms were resolved and mesalizine was resumed after a drop in amylase and lipase level. Symptoms returned the following day, however, accompanied by increased the serum levels of amylase and lipase. Mesalizine was discontinued again and recurring symptoms rapidly improved.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease; treatment strategies have historically been determined by this binary categorisation. Genetic studies have identified 163 susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease, mostly shared between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. We undertook the largest genotype association study, to date, in widely used clinical subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease with the goal of further understanding the biological relations between diseases. METHODS: This study included patients from 49 centres in 16 countries in Europe, North America, and Australasia. We applied the Montreal classification system of inflammatory bowel disease subphenotypes to 34,819 patients (19,713 with Crohn's disease, 14,683 with ulcerative colitis) genotyped on the Immunochip array. We tested for genotype-phenotype associations across 156,154 genetic variants. We generated genetic risk scores by combining information from all known inflammatory bowel disease associations to summarise the total load of genetic risk for a particular phenotype. We used these risk scores to test the hypothesis that colonic Crohn's disease, ileal Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis are all genetically distinct from each other, and to attempt to identify patients with a mismatch between clinical diagnosis and genetic risk profile. FINDINGS: After quality control, the primary analysis included 29,838 patients (16,902 with Crohn's disease, 12,597 with ulcerative colitis). Three loci (NOD2, MHC, and MST1 3p21) were associated with subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease, mainly disease location (essentially fixed over time; median follow-up of 10.5 years). Little or no genetic association with disease behaviour (which changed dramatically over time) remained after conditioning on disease location and age at onset. The genetic risk score representing all known risk alleles for inflammatory bowel disease showed strong association with disease subphenotype (p=1.65 x 10(-78)), even after exclusion of NOD2, MHC, and 3p21 (p=9.23 x 10(-18)). Predictive models based on the genetic risk score strongly distinguished colonic from ileal Crohn's disease. Our genetic risk score could also identify a small number of patients with discrepant genetic risk profiles who were significantly more likely to have a revised diagnosis after follow-up (p=6.8 x 10(-4)). INTERPRETATION: Our data support a continuum of disorders within inflammatory bowel disease, much better explained by three groups (ileal Crohn's disease, colonic Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis) than by Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as currently defined. Disease location is an intrinsic aspect of a patient's disease, in part genetically determined, and the major driver to changes in disease behaviour over time.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory condition requiring significant healthcare expenditure. Subgroups of individuals contribute disproportionately to spending. We aimed to determine demographic and clinical factors predictive of high healthcare expenditures for IBD patients followed over a multiyear period. METHODS: This was a registry analysis using a prospective observational, consented, natural history registry from a tertiary IBD center and associated medical charges, not including pharmacy expenses. The 100 patients with the highest medical charges (top 5%) were compared with the median 300 patients. Logistic regression determined demographic and clinical factors associated with high charge patients. RESULTS: IBD patients in the high charge group had significantly more unemployment (P < 0.0001), were of black race (P = 0.013), comorbid psychiatric illness (P = 0.002), hypertension (P = 0.01), diabetes (P = 0.004), opiate use (P < 0.0001), perianal involvement (P = 0.002), penetrating disease (P < 0.0001), and extensive colitis (P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, unemployment (Crohn's disease [CD]: odds ratio [OR], 3.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-7.02; ulcerative colitis [UC]: OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.20-5.99), psychiatric illness (UC: OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.03-4.19), opiates (CD: OR, 5.61; 95% CI, 2.67-11.82; UC: OR, 5.14; 95% CI, 2.52-10.48), prior surgery (CD: OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.59-6.82; UC: OR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.39-5.32), penetrating CD (OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.02-10.62), and corticosteroid requirement (CD: OR, 3.78; 95% CI, 1.86-7.65; UC: OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.51-5.90) remained independently associated with high charges. CONCLUSIONS: High expenditure IBD patients were affected by more severe disease. The high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and chronic pain in these patients suggests the need for focused treatment of these comorbidities ultimately to reduce financial burden.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: L-arginine (L-Arg) is the substrate for both inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS2) and arginase (ARG) enzymes. L-Arg is actively transported into cells by means of cationic amino acid transporter (SLC7) proteins. We have linked L-Arg and arginase 1 activity to epithelial restitution. Our aim was to determine if L-Arg, related amino acids, and metabolic enzymes are altered in ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Serum and colonic tissues were prospectively collected from 38 control subjects and 137 UC patients. Dietary intake, histologic injury, and clinical disease activity were assessed. Amino acid levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were measured by real-time PCR. Colon tissue samples from 12 Crohn's disease patients were obtained for comparison. RESULTS: Dietary intake of arginine and serum L-Arg levels were not different in UC patients versus control subjects. In active UC, tissue L-Arg was decreased, whereas L-citrulline (L-Cit) and the L-Cit/L-Arg ratio were increased. This pattern was also seen when paired involved (left) versus uninvolved (right) colon tissues in UC were assessed. In active UC, SLC7A2 and ARG1 mRNA levels were decreased, whereas ARG2 and NOS2 were increased. Similar alterations in mRNA expression occurred in tissues from Crohn's disease patients. In involved UC, SLC7A2 and ARG1 mRNA levels were decreased, and NOS2 and ARG2 increased, when compared with uninvolved tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with UC exhibit diminished tissue L-Arg, likely attributable to decreased cellular uptake and increased consumption by NOS2. These findings combined with decreased ARG1 expression indicate a pattern of dysregulated L-Arg availability and metabolism in UC.},

   abstract = {There is robust evidence that habitual physical activity is anti-inflammatory and protective against developing chronic inflammatory disease. Much less is known about the effects of habitual moderate exercise in the gut, the compartment that has the greatest immunological responsibility and interactions with the intestinal microbiota. The link between the two has become evident, as recent studies have linked intestinal dysbiosis, or the disproportionate balance of beneficial to pathogenic microbes, with increased inflammatory disease susceptibility. Limited animal and human research findings imply that exercise may have a beneficial role in preventing and ameliorating such diseases by having an effect on gut immune function and, recently, microbiome characteristics. Emerging data from our laboratory show that different forms of exercise training differentially impact the severity of intestinal inflammation during an inflammatory insult (for example, ulcerative colitis) and may be jointly related to gut immune cell homeostasis and microbiota-immune interactions. The evidence we review and present will provide data in support of rigorous investigations concerning the effects of habitual exercise on gut health and disease.},

Both disease processes can share similar clinical symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia, and weight loss; CD can also be complicated by penetrating and fistulizing disease. Perianal skin tags, perianal abscesses, recto-cutaneous fistulae, and rectal stenosis are among the phenotypic characteristics of perianal CD. Current treatment strategies are focused on the surgical drainage of abscesses and the closure of fistulous tracts as well as controlling intestinal inflammation with the use of immunomodulators (6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate) and biologics (infliximab and adalimumab). Current guidelines by the American Gastroenterology Association and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition recommend a combination of surgical intervention and medical management for the treatment of perianal CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of current smoking on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) course has been studied extensively; smoking is deleterious in Crohn's disease (CD), and beneficial in ulcerative colitis (UC). Except for enteral nutrition, there are only limited data regarding the impact of diet on disease course. KEY MESSAGES: Current smoking worsens the course of CD, increasing the incidence of flares, the need for steroids, immunosuppressants and re-operations. Conversely, smoking cessation has a rapid beneficial effect on disease course, decreasing the risk of flares and of post-operative recurrences. From 3 months after the quit date, quitters have a disease course similar to that of never smokers. Achieving smoking cessation in CD is thus an important goal of therapy. On the contrary, smoking improves the course of UC and in particular, is associated with a decreased need for colectomy. Smoking cessation increases the risk of flare and the need for steroids or immunosuppressants. However, patients with UC should not be discouraged to quit, because the beneficial effect of smoking for their disease is counterbalanced by the deleterious systemic effects of tobacco. Among dietary interventions, only exclusive enteral nutrition was shown to induce remission and achieve mucosal healing in some patients with CD. The beneficial effect of liquid-defined diet is observed whatever be the type of administration (orally or by tube), the type of diet regarding protein and fat content and resulting alterations in the gut microbiota. In UC, enteral nutrition has no effect. Finally, popularized restrictive diets in IBD as the specific-carbohydrate diet and the gluten-free diet have not been rigorously tested. In a small trial, a semi-vegetarian diet was shown to be effective in maintaining remission over 2 years in CD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD should not smoke and avoid passive smoking. Aside from the defined liquid diets, there is no rationale for advising particular diets.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), comprised of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are chronic disorders characterized by worsening of symptoms followed by symptom-free periods. Symptoms have a profound negative impact on quality of life and are associated with increased health care utilization. Despite effective treatments, outcomes are suboptimal secondary to nonadherence, medication intolerance, inconsistent monitoring, poor patient knowledge and limited access to care. OBJECTIVES: Compare disease activity and quality of life over 1 year in a randomized trial of IBD patients receiving standard care versus telemedicine. METHODS: Patients evaluated at 3 IBD referral centers with worsening symptoms within the last 2 years are eligible for randomization to one of two interventions or standard care. The interventions consist of either every other week or weekly assessment of symptoms, side effects, weight and delivery of medication prompts and education via texts to the participant's mobile phone. Individualized alerts and action plans are created on a secure portal. Participants in the standard care group undergo routine and urgent follow-up visits and telephone calls. The primary outcomes group comparisons of changes in disease activity and quality of life scores from baseline to 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Methods such as telemedicine are needed to improve monitoring, adherence, self-efficacy, and patient knowledge in IBD. If effective, telemedicine should decrease symptoms, improve quality of life, and decrease health care utilization. The burden associated with use of telemedicine for patients and providers needs to be assessed. The trial is ongoing and will be completed in July 2016.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The stability and composition of intestinal flora plays a vital role in human wellbeing throughout life from as early as birth. Over the past 50 years, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of probiotic administration in pediatric gastroenterology. This document aims to provide a recommendation score on probiotic utilization in pediatric gastroenterology, together with a review of current knowledge concerning its benefits, tolerability, and safety. STUDY DESIGN: Published literature was selected without study design restriction: clinical guidelines, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, outcomes research and case-controlled studies were selected using the following MESH-validated terms: probiotics, diarrhea, acute diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, bacterial diarrhea, nosocomial diarrhea, prophylactic diarrhea, Helicobacter pylori infection, colic, infantile colic, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), inflammatory bowel disease, constipation, and allergy. Once the validity and the quality of results were evaluated, a recommendation score and level of evidence were assigned for pediatric gastrointestinal-related conditions, according to the updated Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines: 1a for systematic review (SR) of RCTs, 1b for individual RCT, 1c for SR and individual RCT, 2a for SR of cohort studies, 2b for individual cohort studies, 2c for outcomes research, and 3a for SR of case-control studies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Latin American Expert group consensus recommends the use of the following probiotics for pediatric gastrointestinal conditions: prevention of acute infectious diarrhea (AID): 1b for Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), and L. reuteri; prevention of nosocomial diarrhea: 1 b for B. lactis Bb12, B. bifidum, LGG and Streptococcus thermophiles; treatment of AID: 1a for LGG and S. boulardii, 1b for L. reuteri; prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: 1b for LGG and S. boulardii; prevention of traveler's diarrhea: 1b for S. boulardii; prevention of infantile colic: 1a for L. reuteri DSM 17938; treatment of infantile colic: 1b for L. reuteri DSM 17938; prevention of NEC: 1a for B. breve, mixtures of Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus, LGG, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri DSM 17938; induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis: 1b for VSL#3; improving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome: 2c for LGG and VSL#3.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at a high risk of malnutrition and retain an altered body composition. We hypothesized that anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) alpha therapy may improve dietary intake and have a beneficial influence on body composition in these patients. METHODS: Our study involved 40 IBD outpatients (33 Crohn's disease, 7 ulcerative colitis); 24 of these received adalimumab (160/80/40EOW) and 16 were treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg at week 0, 2, 6, and subsequently every 8 weeks). Body composition was measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis, while dietary intake was recorded prior to initiating biologicals and 3 months afterwards. Body composition indexes: fat-free mass index [FFMI], body fat mass index [BFMI]) were calculated in kg/m2. RESULTS: Baseline BMI (kg/m2) and muscle parameters increased significantly at the end of the observational period (BMI: 23.81+/-7.19 vs. 24.52+/-7.34, p<0.001; FFMI: 17.64+/-3.00 vs. 18.14+/-3.08, p<0.001; at week 0 vs. 12, respectively). However, no significant changes were detected in the fat parameters (BFMI: 6.21+/-5.20 vs. 6.44+/-5.27, respectively). We found no significant difference between the effects of adalimumab vs. infliximab on body composition (deltaFFMI: 0.55+/-0.82 vs. 0.43+/-0.69; deltaBFMI: 0.23+/-0.85 vs. 0.21+/-1.01, respectively). No significant difference was observed in the extent of changes in parameters whether the patients were on corticosteroids (n=15) or not (n=25) at week 0 (deltaFFMI: 0.44+/-0.84 vs 0.59+/-0.72; deltaBFMI: 0.36+/-1.12 vs. 0.09+/-0.71, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that muscle parameters improved during the anti-TNF induction therapy, while fat parameters did not change significantly. Thus, induction anti-TNF therapy might have a beneficial effect on body composition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid; 5-ASA) use in pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). AIM: To evaluate pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of 5-ASA and metabolite acetyl-5-ASA (Ac-5-ASA) after once-daily, oral administration of multimatrix mesalamine to children and adolescents with UC. METHODS: Participants (5-17 years of age; 18-82 kg, stratified by weight) with UC received multi-matrix mesalamine 30, 60, or 100 mg/kg/day once daily (to 4,800 mg/day) for 7 days. Blood samples were collected pre-dose on days 5 and 6. On days 7 and 8, blood and urine samples were collected and safety was evaluated. 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA plasma and urine concentrations were analyzed by non-compartmental methods and used to develop a population pharmacokinetic model. RESULTS: Fifty-two subjects (21 [30 mg/kg]; 22 [60 mg/kg]; 9 [100 mg/kg]) were randomized. On day 7, systemic exposures of 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA exhibited a dose-proportional increase between 30 and 60 mg/kg/day cohorts. For 30, 60, and 100 mg/kg/day doses, mean percentages of 5-ASA absorbed were 29.4%, 27.0%, and 22.1%, respectively. Simulated steady-state exposures and variabilities for 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA (coefficient of variation approximately 50% and 40%-45%, respectively) were similar to those observed previously in adults at comparable doses. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by ten subjects. Events were similar among different doses and age groups with no new safety signals identified. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents with UC receiving multimatrix mesalamine demonstrated 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA pharmacokinetic profiles similar to historical adult data. Multimatrix mesalamine was well tolerated across all dose and age groups. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01130844.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The strategy of using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) remains unclear if single FMT failed to induce remission. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a designed step-up FMT strategy for the steroid-dependent UC. METHODS: Fifteen patients with steroid-dependent UC were enrolled, and treated with step-up FMT strategy. Follow-up clinical data was collected for a minimum of 3 months. Fecal microbiota composition before and post FMT of patients and related donors were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Eight of fourteen (57.1 %) patients achieved clinical improvement and were able to discontinue steroids following step-up FMT. One patient was lost to follow-up. Among the 8 patients who responded, five (35.7 %) received one FMT therapy, one (7.1 %) received two FMTs, and two (14.2 %) received two FMTs plus a scheduled course of steroids. Four (28.6 %) of the 8 patients who responded maintained long-term remission during follow-up (3-18 months). Six patients (42.9 %) failed to meet the criteria of clinical improvement and maintained steroid dependence, though three experienced transient or partial improvement. Microbiota analysis showed that FMT altered the composition greatly, and a microbiota composition highly similar to that of the donor emerged in the patients with successful treatment. No severe adverse events occurred during treatment and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Step-up FMT strategy shows promise as a therapeutic strategy for patients with steroid-dependent UC, likely due to the successful restructuring of gut microbial composition.

   abstract = {Functional bowel disorders (FBD), mainly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional constipation (FC, also called chronic idiopathic constipation), are very common worldwide. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, although less common, has a strong impact on patients' quality of life, as well as being highly expensive for our healthcare. A definite cure for those disorders is still yet to come. Over the years, several therapeutic approaches complementary or alternative to traditional pharmacological treatments, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fibre and herbal medicinal products, have been investigated for the management of both groups of diseases. However, most available studies are biased by several drawbacks, including small samples and poor methodological quality. Probiotics, in particular Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacilli (among which Lactobacillus rhamnosus), synbiotics, psyllium, and some herbal medicinal products, primarily peppermint oil, seem to be effective in ameliorating IBS symptoms. Synbiotics and fibre seem to be beneficial in FC patients. The probiotic combination VSL#3 may be effective in inducing remission in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis, in whom Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 seems to be as effective as mesalamine in maintaining remission. No definite conclusions can be drawn as to the efficacy of fibre and herbal medicinal products in IBD patients due to the low number of studies and the lack of randomized controlled trials that replicate the results obtained in the individual studies conducted so far. Thus, further, well-designed studies are needed to address the real role of these therapeutic options in the management of both FBD and IBD.

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) diarrhea can be caused by exacerbation and/or infectious agents. Fecal calprotectin (FC) is a well-established biomarker of intestinal inflammation in IBD. However, its usefulness in depiction of IBD exacerbation from infectious diarrhea is limited. The value of fecal pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type 2 (M2-PK) in this application remains unknown. AIM: To compare the performance of M2-PK and FC in discriminating between diarrhea caused by IBD and infectious agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred three patients were enrolled for the study, including 32 with ulcerative colitis (UC), 21 with Crohn's disease (CD), 29 with acute diarrhea caused by rotavirus (AD-RV), and 21 with acute diarrhea caused by Salmonella enteritidis (AD-SE). M2-PK and FC were measured using ELISA. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), sensitivities and specificities for both tests in distinguishing between patient subgroups with moderate to severe UC and CD from AD-RV and AD-SE were calculated. RESULTS: Differences in AUCs between M2-PK and FC for distinguishing UC [CD] from AD-RV were -0.06 (p < 0.028) [-0.10 (p < 0.0018)] and for differentiating UC [CD] from AD-SE were 0.03 (NS) [-0.19(p < 0.0011)].M2-PK sensitivities and specificities in distinguishing UC [CD] from AD-RV were 75.0%[71.4%] and 89.7% [89.7%] and for differentiation of UC [CD] from AD-SE were 56.3% [71.4%] and 95.2[57.1%]. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of M2-PK in distinguishing between children with moderate-to-severe IBD and patients with infectious gastroenteritis was inferior to FC. Neither test had sensitivity ands pecificity sufficient for everyday clinical application.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron sucrose (IS) in iron deficient children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in remission. METHODS: Electronic medical records at a university based pediatric children's hospital were searched for patients in age range 0 to 18 years with diagnosis of IBD and treatment with IS over a 1-year period. Response to IS treatment was assessed by posttreatment changes in ferritin, hemoglobin (Hb), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Patients with recorded symptoms of active disease were excluded from analysis of treatment response. RESULTS: Twelve patients were identified by the search criteria, 10 with Crohn's disease (CD), 2 with ulcerative colitis (UC). Data represent 8 patients in remission, 7 with CD and 1 with UC, who received a total of 34 IS infusions. Iron sucrose was administered in cycles of 2 infusions, 2.5 to 3.5 mg/kg/dose (maximum 200 mg), 1 week apart. Mean ferritin increased from 21.4 +/- 9.2 to 52.9 +/- 10.1 ng/mL (p = 0.0005), Hb from 10.9 +/- 0.4 to 11.3 +/- 0.3 g/dL (p = 0.02), and MCV from 76.9 +/- 2 to 79.4 +/- 2 fl (p = 0.006). Iron sucrose treatment normalized ferritin in 6 of 7, Hb in 2 of 8, and MCV in 2 of 5 patients with low pretreatment levels. No adverse effects were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Two IS infusions of 2.5 to 3.5 mg/kg/dose (maximum 200 mg), given 1 week apart normalized ferritin levels in most pediatric IBD patients in remission without adverse effects. Further studies are needed to determine optimal dosing schedules.},

Presented herein is a dual flow microfluidic device which holds full thickness human intestinal tissue in a known orientation. The luminal and serosal sides are independently perfused ex vivo with nutrients with simultaneous waste removal for up to 72 h. The microfluidic device maintains the viability and integrity of the tissue as demonstrated through Haematoxylin & Eosin staining, immunohistochemistry and release of lactate dehydrogenase. In addition, the inflammatory state remains in the tissue after perfusion on the device as determined by measuring calprotectin levels. It is anticipated that this human model will be extremely useful for studying the biology and testing novel interventions in diseased tissue.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacteria play a role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in IBD. Compositional alterations may also change the metabolic capacities of the gut bacteria. OBJECTIVE: To examine the metabolic activity of the microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), UC or pouchitis compared with healthy controls (HC) and determine whether eventual differences might be related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained from 40 HC, 83 patients with CD, 68 with UC and 13 with pouchitis. Disease activity was assessed in CD using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, in UC using the UC Disease Activity Index and in pouchitis using the Pouchitis Disease Activity Index. Metabolite profiles were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of metabolites identified in HC (54) was significantly higher than in patients with CD (44, p<0.001), UC (47, p=0.042) and pouchitis (43, p=0.036). Multivariate discriminant analysis predicted HC, CD, UC and pouchitis group membership with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs: pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate and nonanoate), and of some protein fermentation metabolites, were significantly decreased in patients with CD, UC and pouchitis. Hexanoate levels were inversely correlated to disease activity in CD (correlation coefficient=-0.157, p=0.046), whereas a significant positive correlation was found between styrene levels and disease activity in UC (correlation coefficient=0.338, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Faecal metabolic profiling in patients with IBD relative to healthy controls identified MCFAs as important metabolic biomarkers of disease-related changes.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The presentation of Crohn's disease (CD) is heterogeneous and often leads to serious complications and need for surgery. We tested serum anti-zymogen granule glycoprotein 2 (GP2) antibodies, including its novel isoform alpha, for association with genetic variants, diagnosis, disease stratification, and prediction of CD courses in a combined cross-sectional and cohort study. METHODS: Serum samples of 303 CD, 108 ulcerative colitis, 72 other inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases, and 206 controls without predominant gastrointestinal diseases controls (HC) were tested for the presence of Anti-GP2 and Anti-Saccharomyces cervisiae (ASCA) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genetic analysis was performed using the Illumina Immunochip. RESULTS: GP2 IgA and IgG had the highest discriminatory capability for CD versus ulcerative colitis and CD versus inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases. We identified an association of GP2 IgA and IgG each with 5 distinct single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Levels of anti-GP2 IgG were moderately associated with ileal disease location. Interestingly, both, anti-GP2 IgA and IgG were exclusively associated with the occurrence of stenosis and need for surgery, independently of disease location, but not with fistulizing CD, early disease onset or disease activity. ASCA IgG and IgA were qualitatively and quantitatively linked to CD, CD complications, and need for surgery. Increased levels of ASCA IgG and IgA and positivity for ASCA IgG, but neither levels nor positivity for GP2 IgG or IgA were predictive of the earlier occurrence of complications or surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-GP2 antibodies may aid as a tool for diagnosis and differentiation of CD and could indicate a more complicated CD course.},

Its specialization in mucin degradation makes it a key organism at the mucosal interface between the lumen and host cells. Although it was isolated quite recently, it has rapidly raised significant interest as A. muciniphila is the only cultivated intestinal representative of the Verrucomicrobia, one of the few phyla in the human gut that can be easily detected in phylogenetic and metagenome analyses. There has also been a growing interest in A. muciniphila, due to its association with health in animals and humans. Notably, reduced levels of A. muciniphila have been observed in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (mainly ulcerative colitis) and metabolic disorders, which suggests it may have potential anti-inflammatory properties. The aims of this review are to summarize the existing data on the intestinal distribution of A. muciniphila in health and disease, to provide insight into its ecology and its role in founding microbial networks at the mucosal interface, as well as to discuss recent research on its role in regulating host functions that are disturbed in various diseases, with a specific focus on metabolic disorders in both animals and humans.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Predictive factors for the development of pouchitis after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) in children have not been well studied. In this retrospective study, the incidence and risk factors that predict pouchitis in children with IPAA will be identified. METHODS: The records of patients who underwent IPAA surgery at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin between January 2000 and December 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with clinical, endoscopic, and histological findings consistent with pouchitis were identified. The groups of patients with and without pouchitis or chronic pouchitis were compared to determine which demographic, pathological, or disease characteristics may serve as predictive factors for the development of pouchitis or chronic pouchitis. RESULTS: Out of a total of 60 patients who underwent IPAA, preoperative diagnosis was ulcerative colitis (UC) in 43 and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) in 17. Pouchitis was identified in 24 (56%) patients with UC and 2 (12%) patients with FAP. Subgroup analysis of patients with UC revealed that chronic pouchitis occurred in 15 (35%) patients. The median follow-up period from construction of the IPAA was 35 months (range 4.59-104.26 months). The study analysis revealed that a higher Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index score at the time of diagnosis was a significant predictive factor for both pouchitis (P = 0.001) and chronic pouchitis (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with UC and a higher PUCAI score at the time of diagnosis have a higher risk for developing pouchitis.},

The recent guidelines from the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization/European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition conclude that thalidomide cannot be recommended in refractory pediatric Crohn's disease but that it may be considered in selected cohorts of patients who are not anti-TNFalpha agent responders. The main adverse effect is the potential teratogenicity that renders the long-term use of thalidomide problematic in young adults due to the strict need for contraceptive use. In short-term use it is relatively safe; the most likely adverse effect is the neuropathy, which is highly reversible in children. So far the use of thalidomide is reported in 223 adult and pediatric IBD patients (206 with Crohn's disease). In the following sections, the authors will discuss efficacy and safety of thalidomide, in the short-term treatment of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A large proportion (25-46%) of adults with inflammatory bowel disease in remission has symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which are thought to reflect ongoing inflammation. Data on paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients are lacking. AIM: To investigate (i) the prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients in remission and (ii) the relationship of IBS-type symptoms with biochemical markers of disease activity. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included all patients (<18 years) with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis attending the out-patient clinic of one of three Dutch hospitals between March 2014 and June 2015. Clinical disease activity was determined using the abbreviated-PCDAI or PUCAI. Biochemical disease activity was assessed using faecal calprotectin and serum CRP. IBS-symptoms were assessed using physician-administered Rome III-questionnaires. RESULTS: We included 184 patients (92 female; mean age: 14.5 years) (Crohn's disease: 123, ulcerative colitis: 61). The prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children with inflammatory bowel disease in clinical remission was 6.4% (95% CI: 2.5-11.1%; Crohn's disease: 4.5%; ulcerative colitis: 10.8%). Prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children with faecal calprotectin <250 mug/g was 16.1% (95% CI: 7.6-25.8%; Crohn's disease: 16.7%; ulcerative colitis: 10.8%). No difference in faecal calprotectin or CRP was found between patients in clinical remission with or without IBS-type symptoms (faecal calprotectin: IBS+ median 58 mug/g, IBS- 221 mug/g, P = 0.12; CRP: IBS+ median 1.4 mg/L, IBS- 1.1 mg/L, P = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children with inflammatory bowel disease is highly dependent on the definition of remission. Nonetheless, the prevalence is much lower than that previously reported in studies in adult inflammatory bowel disease patients. IBS-type symptoms appear to be unrelated to gastrointestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) is a noninvasive disease activity index developed as a clinical trial endpoint. More recently, practice guidelines have recommended the use of PUCAI in routine clinical care. We therefore sought to evaluate the feasibility, validity, and responsiveness of PUCAI in a large, diverse collection of pediatric gastroenterology practices. METHODS: We extracted data from the 2 most recent encounters for patients with ulcerative colitis in the ImproveCareNow registry. Feasibility was determined by the percentage of patients for whom all PUCAI components were recorded, validity by correlation of PUCAI scores across physician global assessment (PGA) categories, and responsiveness to change by the correlation between the change in PUCAI and PGA scores between visits. RESULTS: A total of 2503 patients were included (49.5% boys, age 15.2 +/- 4.1 years, disease duration 3.7 +/- 3.2 years). All items in the PUCAI were completed for 96% of visits. PUCAI demonstrated excellent discriminatory ability between remission, mild, and moderate disease; discrimination between moderate and severe disease was less robust. There was good correlation with PGA (r = 0.76 [P < 0.001] and weighted kappa kappa = 0.73 [P < 0.001]). The PUCAI change scores correlated well with PGA change scores (P < 0.001). Test-retest reliability of the PUCAI was good (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.72 [95% confidence interval 0.70-0.75], P < 0.001). Guyatt responsiveness statistic was 1.18, and the correlation of DeltaPUCAI with DeltaPGA was 0.69 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The PUCAI is feasible to use in routine clinical settings. Evidence of its validity and responsiveness supports its use as a clinical tool for monitoring disease activity for patients with ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) care is complex and rapidly evolving. The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition cosponsored a needs assessment survey of pediatric gastroenterology trainees and program directors (PDs) to inform on educational programming. METHODS: A Web-based, self-completed survey was provided to North American trainees and PDs during the 2013-2014 academic year. Standard descriptive statistics summarized demographics and responses. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-six of 326 (51%) trainees (62% female) and 37 of 74 (50%) PDs responded. Median trainees per program = 5 and median total faculty = 10 (3 IBD experts); 15% of programs did not have a self-identified "IBD expert" faculty member. Sixty-nine percent of trainees were confident/somewhat confident in their IBD inpatient training, whereas 54% were confident/somewhat confident in their outpatient training. Trainees identified activities that would most improve their education, including didactics (55%), interaction with national experts (50%), trainee-centered IBD Web resources (42%), and increased patient exposure (42%). Trainees were most confident in managing inpatient active Crohn's disease/ulcerative colitis, phenotype classification, managing biological therapies, and using clinical disease activity indices. They were least confident in managing J-pouch complications, performing pouchoscopy, managing extraintestinal manifestations, and ostomy-related complications. Eighty-five percent would like an IBD-focused training elective. Most directors (86%) would allow trainees to do electives at other institutions. CONCLUSIONS: This IBD needs assessment survey of pediatric gastroenterology trainees and PDs demonstrated a strong resource commitment to IBD training and clinical care. Areas for educational enrichment emerged, including pouch and ostomy complications.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: UC is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colonic mucosa. Growing evidence supports a role for epithelial cell defects in driving pathology. Moreover, long-lasting changes in the epithelial barrier have been reported in quiescent UC. Our aim was to investigate whether epithelial cell defects could originate from changes in the epithelial compartment imprinted by the disease. DESIGN: Epithelial organoid cultures (EpOCs) were expanded ex vivo from the intestinal crypts of non-IBD controls and patients with UC. EpOCs were induced to differentiate (d-EpOCs), and the total RNA was extracted for microarray and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses. Whole intestinal samples were used to determine mRNA expression by qPCR, or protein localisation by immunostaining. RESULTS: EpOCs from patients with UC maintained self-renewal potential and the capability to give rise to differentiated epithelial cell lineages comparable with control EpOCs. Nonetheless, a group of genes was differentially regulated in the EpOCs and d-EpOCs of patients with UC, including genes associated with antimicrobial defence (ie, LYZ, PLA2G2A), with secretory (ie, ZG16, CLCA1) and absorptive (ie, AQP8, MUC12) functions, and with a gastric phenotype (ie, ANXA10, CLDN18 and LYZ). A high rate of concordance was found in the expression profiles of the organoid cultures and whole colonic tissues from patients with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Permanent changes in the colonic epithelium of patients with UC could be promoted by alterations imprinted in the stem cell compartment. These changes may contribute to perpetuation of the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: De novo Crohn's disease (CD) of the neo-small intestine in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients after total proctocolectomy (TPC) is a new disease entity, which may persist even after a secondary diverting permanent ileostomy for pouch failure. We sought to compare outcomes of primary ileostomy (PI, i.e., stoma created after colectomy without trying of ileal pouch) and secondary ileostomy (SI, i.e., stoma created after pouch failure) and to evaluate factors associated with the development of CD of the neo-small intestine proximal to ileostomy. METHODS: A total of 123 eligible patients were identified from our Pouch Center Registry (PI group, n = 57 and SI group, n = 66). Demographics, clinical features and outcomes (CD of theneo-small intestine, non-CD related strictures, requirement of CD-related medications use, ileostomy-associated hospitalization, ileostomy failure with stoma revision/relocation, and shortgut syndrome) were compared. Step-wise logistic regression models were performed. RESULTS: The median follow-up for the whole cohort was 5.0 (2.0-12.0) years. Younger age at diagnosis and surgery, family history of IBD, toxic megacolon/fulminant colitis, pre-diversion severe diarrhea, prediversion anti-TNF biological therapy, arthralgia/arthropathy and staged surgery were more common in the SI group (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, the presence of SI [odds ratio (OR), 8.23; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.43-27.85], family history of IBD (OR, 9.14; 95% CI, 3.13-26.69), and pre-diversion of weight loss (OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.23-11.21) were contributing factors for developing CD of the neo-small intestine. CONCLUSIONS: CD of the neo-small intestine in stoma patients was associated with the presence of SI, family history of IBD, and pre-diversion poor nutrition status. Patients with secondary ileostomy due to pouch failure should be carefully monitored. Aggressive medical, endoscopic or surgical therapy may be needed in patients at risk, before permanent diversion.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Studies have shown tumorigenetic and histomorphological differences between IBD-associated CRC and non-IBD CRC, suggesting differences in tumor behavior and response to treatment. We aimed to compare tumor recurrence and survival rates following postoperative chemotherapy in CRC patients with and without IBD. METHODS: Search of the Cleveland Clinic's CRC database revealed 65 patients who had IBD-associated CRC and received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy between 1994 and 2010. Twenty-one patients were excluded due to incomplete clinical data. Propensity score-matching based on age, surgery intent, CRC site, tumor grade, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage and T stage was used to match IBD and non-IBD patients (1:4). Competing risk and Cox regression models were used to analyze differences in disease-free survival and overall survival, respectively. RESULTS: Forty-four patients with IBD-associated CRC were matched to 176 patients with non-IBD CRC. Among IBD patients, 29 (66%) had ulcerative colitis, 14 (32%) had Crohn's disease, and one (2%) had indeterminate colitis. Mean IBD diagnosis age was 28.1 +/- 14.5 years, and mean IBD duration at time of CRC treatment was 21.5 +/- 12.6 years. Ten (23%) IBD patients had tumor recurrence compared with 34 (19%) non-IBD patients (P = .074). There was no significant difference in disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.35-1.05; P = 0.074) or overall survival (HR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.54-1.4; P = 0.58) between IBD and non-IBD patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with IBD-associated CRC have comparable rates of tumor recurrence and survival following postoperative chemotherapy as CRC patients without IBD. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and guide therapeutic decisions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Optimising infliximab therapy is recommended in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients who lose response to infliximab; however, there are no data on the outcome of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients after doubling the dose. AIM: To determine the efficacy and safety of infliximab dose doubling in UC patients with a loss of response to infliximab. METHODS: From January 2006 to May 2013, we retrospectively reviewed the outcome of the consecutive UC patients who were treated with infliximab dose doubling (10 mg/kg) for loss of response in four French academic centres. The clinical response and remission were assessed. A composite event-free survival analysis was performed using the log-rank test and the Cox model. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-seven patients [84 males; median age 37. 6 (IQR 28.2-49.4) years] were included. The median follow-up after infliximab dose doubling was 1.8 (1.0-3.1) years. At weeks 8 and 24, 55% and 43% of the patients achieved a clinical response respectively. The probabilities of the event-free survival were 71%, 61% and 55% at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the predictors of infliximab dose doubling failure were the absence of the introduction of an immunomodulator concomitantly to dose doubling, a partial Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index >6, a C-reactive protein level >10 mg/L, a leucocyte count >8000/mm(3) and a haemoglobin level <12.5 g/dL. Adverse events were reported in 12 patients (8%). CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab dose doubling led to short- and long-term event-free survival in UC patients, who had a loss of response to infliximab, in greater than 50% of the cases. The benefits of such a strategy were significantly improved by adding a concomitant immunomodulator.},

   abstract = {Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC). Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.},

These factors may either increase the risk of or protect against developing this condition and can also affect the course of illness in a positive or negative manner. A number of studies have examined the influence of environmental factors on inflammatory bowel diseases as a whole as well as on ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease separately. As there are differences in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the effect of environmental factors on their onset and course is not always similar. Some factors have shown a consistent association, while reports on others have been conflicting. In this article we discuss the current evidence on the roles of these factors on inflammatory bowel disease, both as causative/protective agents and as modifiers of disease course.},

   abstract = {AIM: To assess the prevalence of nutritional disorders in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: The data from a national cohort of children newly diagnosed with IBD between 2003 and 2012 were analyzed. The diagnosis of IBD and the differentiation between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) were confirmed by gastroenterologists according to the standard criteria. The body mass index (BMI) of each child [weight (kg)/height(2) (m)] was calculated at the time of diagnosis. The World Health Organization standards and references were used and the BMI for age > +1 and < -2 standard deviation score were used to define overweight and thinness, respectively. Age stratification analysis was performed to investigate any age-related variation in the prevalence of nutritional status between children < 10 years of age and older. RESULTS: There were 374 children from 0.33 to 17 years of age, including 119 (32%) children with UC and 255 (68%) with CD. All of the children were Saudi nationals, and 68 (57%) of the UC and 150 (59%) of the CD children were males. A positive history of anorexia at the time of diagnosis was found in 30 (25%) patients with UC and 99 (39%) patients with CD. The prevalence of thinness was 31%, 35% and 24% in children with IBD, CD and UC, respectively, with a significantly higher prevalence of thinness in children with CD than in children with UC (P = 0.037) only in the age group of 10-17 years (P = 0.030). The prevalence of overweight was 16 %, 15% and 20 % in the children with IBD, CD and UC, respectively, indicating a higher prevalence in UC that was statistically significant only in the age group of 10-17 years (P = 0.020). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of children with IBD presented with overweight instead of the classical underweight. Awareness of this finding is important for patient care.},

   abstract = {We simultaneously investigated the genetic landscape of ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis to investigate pleiotropy and the relationship between these clinically related diseases. Using high-density genotype data from more than 86,000 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 244 independent multidisease signals, including 27 new genome-wide significant susceptibility loci and 3 unreported shared risk loci. Complex pleiotropy was supported when contrasting multidisease signals with expression data sets from human, rat and mouse together with epigenetic and expressed enhancer profiles. The comorbidities among the five immune diseases were best explained by biological pleiotropy rather than heterogeneity (a subgroup of cases genetically identical to those with another disease, possibly owing to diagnostic misclassification, molecular subtypes or excessive comorbidity). In particular, the strong comorbidity between primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease is likely the result of a unique disease, which is genetically distinct from classical inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abnormal handling of E. coli by lamina propria (LP) macrophages may contribute to Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis. We aimed to determine LP macrophage phenotypes in CD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and healthy controls (HC), and in CD, to compare macrophage phenotypes according to E. coli carriage. METHODS: Mucosal biopsies were taken from 35 patients with CD, 9 with UC and 18 HCs. Laser capture microdissection was used to isolate E. coli-laden and unladen LP macrophages from ileal or colonic biopsies. From these macrophages, mRNA was extracted and cytokine and activation marker expression measured using RT-qPCR. RESULTS: E. coli-laden LP macrophages were identified commonly in mucosal biopsies from CD patients (25/35, 71 %), rarely in UC (1/9, 11 %) and not at all in healthy controls (0/18). LP macrophage cytokine mRNA expression was greater in CD and UC than healthy controls. In CD, E. coli-laden macrophages expressed high IL-10 & CD163 and lower TNFalpha, IL-23 & iNOS irrespective of macroscopic inflammation. In inflamed tissue, E. coli-unladen macrophages expressed high TNFalpha, IL-23 & iNOS and lower IL-10 & CD163. In uninflamed tissue, unladen macrophages had low cytokine mRNA expression, closer to that of healthy controls. CONCLUSION: In CD, intra-macrophage E. coli are commonly found and LP macrophages express characteristic cytokine mRNA profiles according to E. coli carriage. Persistence of E. coli within LP macrophages may provide a stimulus for chronic inflammation.},

We have conducted a single-center, retrospective case series describing the unique clinical and histologic features of this IBD-like chronic intestinal inflammation following solid organ transplant. At our center, nine of 327 kidney or liver recipients developed de novo IBD following transplant (six liver, two kidney, one liver-kidney). Most children presented with prolonged hematochezia and diarrhea and were treated with aminosalicylates. At time of diagnosis, five were not currently using mycophenolate mofetil for transplant immunosuppression. Histologic and endoscopic findings at IBD diagnosis included inflammation, ulcerations, granulomas, and chronic colitis. Since diagnosis, no patients have required surgical intervention, or escalation to biologic therapy, nor developed stricturing or perianal disease. In this case series, de novo post-transplant IBD developed in 4% of pediatric liver and/or kidney recipients; however, it often does not fit the classic patterns of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an important health issue worldwide, accounting for the third place of cancer incidence. Chronic inflammation, as seen in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is the most important risk factor for developing CRC, as it favours neoplastic transformation by enhancing epithelial cell turnover in the colonic mucosa. Treatments for CRC need to be improved; currently they are not specific and have several secondary effects in patients. The main objective of this work was to evaluate a new therapeutic strategy against a colitis-related colorectal cancer in vivo and in vitro by targeting mTOR-signaling and lactate dehydrogenase A. Together, these mechanisms directly affect tumor energetics. In this study we evaluated a better and more efficient triple therapy against a chronic inflammation-associated CRC in vivo and in vitro. After the development of tumors, mice were treated intraperitoneally during a forty-day period with single drugs or different combinations of Metformin, Sodium Oxamate and Doxorubicin. Targeted inhibition of the mTOR pathway, lactate dehydrogenase A and the concurrent use of Doxorubicin (called in this work as triple therapy), leaded to a notable reduction in the number and size of tumors in mice, and, a significant pro-inflammatory cytokines reduction Besides, we showed that treated cells were induced to early autophagy, and apoptosis cell death. Our results represent a novel and robust therapeutic strategy for overcoming CRC by means of targeting central molecular pathways in cancer by the combination of Metformin, Oxamate, and Doxorubicin leading to a rapid tumor growth inhibition and a dramatic colorectal crypt restoration. Besides, drug combination resulted in a notable reduction of anti-inflammatory cytokines.},

   abstract = {Mucosal healing has been a central issue in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for the last years, and has been proposed to be included as the new treatment goal in IBD. The molecular understanding of both the disruption and the healing of the intestinal epithelial cell lining and the mucosal barrier in IBD is complex and only partly understood. There is no general agreement on how to define healed mucosa, but there is a general acceptance that clinicians should use endoscopy and imaging technique in their assessments. Mucosal healing is an old concept that has been actualized in the present era of the highly effective biological agents. Randomized clinical studies with mucosal healing as end-point parameters have been reported, and early mucosal healing has been associated with low complication rates. We are waiting for documentation of whether treatment to healed mucosa can change the natural course of IBD. The concept of immunological remission has recently been introduced and can be the new treatment goal and one of several criteria for discontinuation of biological treatment in IBD. In conclusion, mucosal healing is a fairly novel concept and goal for biological treatment of IBD. There is a need for a standardization of its assessment and validation of the prognostic value.},

Gene expression was measured by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein expression was evaluated in tissue by immunohistochemistry and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by flow cytometry. Higher levels of IL-35 was produced by intestinal regulatory B cells and circulating regulatory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in active vs. inactive disease or healthy donors (P<0.05). The IL-37 was conspicuously synthesized by circulating B cells, active natural killer cells and monocytes. These results suggest that down-regulation of inflammation in active IBD patients might be based on the increased expression of IL-35 and IL-37.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The ESPEN guideline presents a multidisciplinary focus on clinical nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODOLOGY: The guideline is based on extensive systematic review of the literature, but relies on expert opinion when objective data were lacking or inconclusive. The conclusions and 64 recommendations have been subject to full peer review and a Delphi process in which uniformly positive responses (agree or strongly agree) were required. RESULTS: IBD is increasingly common and potential dietary factors in its aetiology are briefly reviewed. Malnutrition is highly prevalent in IBD - especially in Crohn's disease. Increased energy and protein requirements are observed in some patients. The management of malnutrition in IBD is considered within the general context of support for malnourished patients. Treatment of iron deficiency (parenterally if necessary) is strongly recommended. Routine provision of a special diet in IBD is not however supported. Parenteral nutrition is indicated only when enteral nutrition has failed or is impossible. The recommended perioperative management of patients with IBD undergoing surgery accords with general ESPEN guidance for patients having abdominal surgery. Probiotics may be helpful in UC but not Crohn's disease. Primary therapy using nutrition to treat IBD is not supported in ulcerative colitis, but is moderately well supported in Crohn's disease, especially in children where the adverse consequences of steroid therapy are proportionally greater. However, exclusion diets are generally not recommended and there is little evidence to support any particular formula feed when nutritional regimens are constructed. CONCLUSIONS: Available objective data to guide nutritional support and primary nutritional therapy in IBD are presented as 64 recommendations, of which 9 are very strong recommendations (grade A), 22 are strong recommendations (grade B) and 12 are based only on sparse evidence (grade 0); 21 recommendations are good practice points (GPP).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of ulcerative colitis (UC) differs by country, which is likely due to differences in genetic factors among ethnicities. Moreover, the prevalence of pediatric UC with a family history (FH) is 4.1% in Japanese patients; its clinical course begins at an early age and is more severe. Recently, a genome-wide association study identified 3 new susceptibility loci for adult Japanese patients with UC. METHODS: To assess the effects of FH in patients with UC, 60 children were enrolled. Age at diagnosis, clinical features of the initial symptoms, and family structure were assessed in patients with and without an FH. The 3 new loci were examined in patients who provided informed consent. RESULTS: Of the patients with UC, 10 (16.7%) had an FH involving first-degree relatives, including 7 mothers, 1 father, and 2 sisters. There was a trend toward a younger age at onset in the positive FH group. There were, however, no significant differences in the clinical characteristics of the patients regardless of FH. From the genomic analyses, there were significant differences in the polymorphisms of the solute carrier family 26, member 3 (SLC26A3) between those with and without an FH. CONCLUSIONS: Although the etiology of UC remains unknown, there were no observed relation between clinical symptoms and FH. SLC26A3 may, however, contribute to the pathogenesis of UC in Japanese individuals with an FH.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The coexistence of sarcopenia is associated with postoperative complications, including infection after abdominal surgery. We evaluated the association between sarcopenia and surgical site infection (SSI) after surgery for ulcerative colitis. METHODS: The subjects of this retrospective study were 69 patients who underwent restorative proctocolectomy with perioperative abdominal computed tomography (CT). Sarcopenia was diagnosed by measuring the cross-sectional area of the right and left psoas muscles as the total psoas muscle area on CT images. We assessed whether sarcopenia was associated with SSI and clinical factors, including nutritional and inflammatory markers. RESULTS: The lowest quartiles defined as sarcopenia in men and women were 567.4 and 355.8 mm2/m2, respectively. According to this classification, 12 men and 6 women had sarcopenia. Patients with sarcopenia had a lower body mass index (p = 0.0004) and a higher C-reactive protein concentration (p = 0.05) than those without sarcopenia. SSIs were identified in 12 patients (17.3 %) and included six pelvic abscesses and seven wound infections. According to multivariate analysis, sarcopenia was an independent risk factor for SSI (odds ratio = 4.91, 95 % confidence interval 1.09-23.5, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia is predictive of SSI after pouch surgery for ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colonic strictures complicate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and often lead to surgical resection to prevent dysplasia or cancer. We assessed the frequency of dysplasia and cancer among IBD patients undergoing resection of a colorectal stricture. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Groupe d'etudes et therapeutiques des affections inflammatoires du tube digestif study. This was a nationwide retrospective study of 12,013 patients with IBD in France who underwent surgery for strictures at 16 centers from August 1992 through January 2014 (293 patients for a colonic stricture, 248 patients with Crohn's disease, 51% male, median age at stricture diagnosis of 38 years). Participants had no preoperative evidence of dysplasia or cancer. We collected clinical, endoscopic, surgical, and pathology data and information on outcomes. RESULTS: When patients were diagnosed with strictures, they had IBD for a median time of 8 years (3-14). The strictures were a median length of 6 cm (4-10) and caused symptoms in 70% of patients. Of patients with Crohn's disease, 3 (1%) were found to have low-grade dysplasia, 1 (0.4%) was found to have high-grade dysplasia, and 2 (0.8%) were found to have cancer. Of patients with ulcerative colitis, 1 (2%) had low-grade dysplasia, 1 (2%) had high-grade dysplasia, and 2 (5%) had cancer. All patients with dysplasia or cancer received curative surgery, except 1 who died of colorectal cancer during the follow-up period. No active disease at time of surgery was the only factor associated with dysplasia or cancer at the stricture site (odds ratio, 4.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-21.27; P = .036). CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective study of patients with IBD undergoing surgery for colonic strictures, 3.5% were found to have dysplasia or cancer. These findings can be used to guide management of patients with IBD and colonic strictures.},

   abstract = {Colitis-associated colorectal neoplasia (CRN) is a well-known complication of chronic inflammation of the colon either with ulcerative colitis (UC) or colonic Crohn's disease (CD). Studies have shown that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients have an overall higher risk for colorectal dysplasia and cancer compared to the general population and this risk is further increased by certain associated factors, including extent of disease, duration of disease, and age at onset. In addition, other risk factors not related to IBD can also further increase the risk for CRN, such as a family history of sporadic colon cancer and a concomitant diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. The society guidelines mostly agree on the appropriate time to begin CRN surveillance but vary somewhat on the appropriate intervals between surveillance colonoscopies. In addition, there is not yet a consensus on the appropriate method for surveillance. In this review, we discuss the risk for CRN in colonic IBD, the associated factors that further increase the risk for CRN, the current surveillance guidelines and the current methods available for CRN surveillance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, debilitating condition with high emergency department (ED) utilization. We aimed to investigate the utilization patterns of ED by IBD patients and measure hospitalization and surgical rates following ED visits. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of adults with IBD listed as the primary ED diagnosis from the 2009 to 2011 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. The characteristics of the IBD-related ED visits in relation to following hospitalizations and surgeries were analyzed. RESULTS: Adult IBD patients constitute 0.09 % of the total ED visits. Crohn's disease (CD) contributed to 69 % of the IBD-ED visits. The hospitalization rate from ED was 59.9 % nationally, ranging from 56 % in west to 69 % in northeast. The most significant factors associated with hospitalization were intra-abdominal abscess [odds ratio (OR) 24.22], bowel obstruction (OR 17.77), anemia (OR 7.54), malnutrition (OR 6.29), hypovolemia/electrolyte abnormalities (OR 5.57), and fever/abnormal white cell count (OR 3.18). Patients with CD (OR 0.66), low-income group (OR 0.90), and female gender (OR 0.87) have a lower odds of getting hospitalized. Age above 65 years (OR 1.63), CD (OR 1.89), bowel obstruction (OR 9.24), and intra-abdominal abscess (OR 18.41) were significantly associated with surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: The IBD-related ED visits have remained relatively stable from 2009 to 2011. The presence of anemia, malnutrition, hypovolemia, electrolyte abnormalities, fever, abnormal white cell count, bowel obstruction, or intra-abdominal abscess during the ED visit was associated with hospitalization. The presence of bowel obstruction and intra-abdominal abscess was strongly associated with surgical intervention.},

   abstract = {There are no important new data on the aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease. However, some new data were presented on the possible importance of certain nutrients or drugs in the genesis of the disease, as well as other data related to genetic features and their relationship with the microbiota. A highly interesting study suggested the strong potential of serological studies in predicting the course of Crohn's disease. The value of magnetic resonance imaging and the potential of low-radiation-dose tomography were reaffirmed in the monitoring and follow-up of patients and their treatments. Studies also confirmed the utility confirmed of new (and more comfortable) methods of home measurement of faecal calprotectin levels. In individualized therapy, attempts are being made to increase the practical application of new results on anti-TNF levels and their antibodies, for example, by identifying the utility of non-trough levels. We believe that the results presented on the impact of the disease on patients themselves were especially important, from their own perspective and in diverse setting. This impact is important both for patients (not only because of the repercussions of the disease on their quality of life but also on their mental health, disability, stress, and financial situation, etc.) and for their families. Finally, interesting results were presented of well-performed studies on colorectal cancer prevention in inflammatory bowel disease. These results confirm chromoendoscopy as a key technique but suggest that technological advances could change this situation, thus simplifying prevention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are diagnosed between 11 and 16 years of age, commonly presenting with features of typical IBD. Children with onset of gut inflammation under 5 years of age often have a different underlying pathophysiology, one that is genetically and phenotypically distinct from other children with IBD. We therefore set out to assess whether children diagnosed after the age of 5 years, but before the age of 11, have a different clinical presentation and outcome when compared to those presenting later. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study conducted at two European Paediatric Gastroenterology Units. Two cohorts of children with IBD (total number = 160) were compared: 80 children diagnosed between 5 and 10 years (Group A), versus 80 children diagnosed between 11 and 16 (Group B). Statistical analysis included multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Group A presented with a greater disease activity (p = 0.05 for Crohn's disease (CD), p = 0.03 for Ulcerative Colitis (UC); Odds Ratio 1.09, 95 % Confidence Interval: 1.02-1.1), and disease extent (L2 location more frequent amongst Group A children with CD (p = 0.05)). No significant differences were observed between age groups in terms of gastro-intestinal and extra-intestinal signs and symptoms at disease presentation, nor was there a difference in the number of hospitalisations due to relapsing IBD during follow-up. However, children in Group A were treated earlier with immunosuppressants and had more frequent endoscopic assessments. CONCLUSION: While clinicians feel children between 5 and 10 years of age have a more severe disease course than adolescents, our analysis also suggests a greater disease burden in this age group. Nevertheless, randomized trials to document longer-term clinical outcomes are urgently needed, in order to address the question whether a younger age at disease onset should prompt per se a more "aggressive" treatment. We speculate that non-clinical factors (e.g. genetics, epigenetics) may have more potential to predict longer term outcome than simple clinical measures such as age at diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The main symptom of ulcerative colitis is diarrhoea, which is often accompanied by painful tenesmus and faecal blood and mucus. It sometimes co-occurs with abdominal pain, fever, feeling of fatigue, loss of appetite and weight loss. Some dietary factors have been indicated as important in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The aim of the study was to analyse the association between retinoid intake (total vitamin A, retinol, beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin) and ulcerative colitis symptoms (abdominal pain, faecal blood, faecal mucus, faecal pus) in individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission. METHODS: Assessment of diet was based on self-reported data from each patient's dietary records taken over a period of three typical, random days (2 weekdays and 1 day of the weekend). RESULTS: A total of 56 individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission (19 males and 37 females) were recruited for the study. One in every four individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission was characterised as having inadequate vitamin A intake. Higher lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin intakes in individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission were associated with lower faecal blood, mucus and pus but not with lower incidence of abdominal pain. Higher carotene intake in individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission may contribute to higher incidence of faecal mucus. CONCLUSIONS: Optimising intake of specific retinoids may enhance disease control in individuals with ulcerative colitis. Prospective studies, including patient reported and objective outcomes, are required to confirm this.},

   abstract = {Genome-wide association studies of the related chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) known as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have shown strong evidence of association to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This region encodes a large number of immunological candidates, including the antigen-presenting classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. Studies in IBD have indicated that multiple independent associations exist at HLA and non-HLA genes, but they have lacked the statistical power to define the architecture of association and causal alleles. To address this, we performed high-density SNP typing of the MHC in >32,000 individuals with IBD, implicating multiple HLA alleles, with a primary role for HLA-DRB1*01:03 in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Noteworthy differences were observed between these diseases, including a predominant role for class II HLA variants and heterozygous advantage observed in ulcerative colitis, suggesting an important role of the adaptive immune response in the colonic environment in the pathogenesis of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) and their treatment in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Since 2008, the Pediatric Swiss IBD Cohort Study has collected data on the pediatric IBD population in Switzerland. Data on 329 patients were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: 55 patients (16.7%) suffered from 1-4 EIM (39 Crohn's disease, 12 ulcerative colitis and 4 IBD-Unclassified (IBD-U) patients). At IBD onset, presence of EIM was more frequent than in the adult population (8.5% vs. 5.0%, p = 0.014). EIM were more frequent in CD when compared to UC/IBD-U (22.5 vs. 10.3%, p = 0.003). The most prevalent EIM were peripheral arthritis (26/329, 7.9%) and aphthous stomatitis (24/329, 7.3%). 27.6% of all EIM appeared before IBD diagnosis. Median time between IBD diagnosis and occurrence of first EIM was 1 month (-37.5-149.0). 31 of the 55 patients (56.4%) were treated with one or more anti-TNF agents. IBD patients with EIM were more likely to be treated with anti-TNF compared to those without (56.4% vs. 35.0%, p = 0.003). Response rates to anti-TNF depended on underlying EIM and were best for peripheral arthritis (61.5%) and uveitis (66.7%). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of pediatric IBD patients, EIM were frequently encountered. In up to 30%, EIM appeared before IBD diagnosis. Knowledge of these findings might translate into an increased awareness of underlying IBD, thereby decreasing diagnostic delay. Anti- TNF for the treatment of certain EIM is effective although a substantial proportion of new EIM might present despite ongoing anti-TNF therapy.},

   abstract = {Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated to a change in stool consistency or frequency, include low-grade inflammation and intestinal microbiota changes. Few and disappointing data are available for prebiotics. A few controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics are instead available with favourable effects, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. A recent report from the Rome foundation group included 32 RCTs of probiotics, most of which showed an overall modest improvement in symptoms, with the patients most benefitting from probiotics being those with predominant diarrhoea and those having a post-infectious IBS. A review focusing only on children with functional gastrointestinal disorders concluded that probiotics are more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders, although no effect on constipation was evident. The role for probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears logical: the endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a central role in their development, and various probiotics have been found effective in animal models of IBD. However, research in humans has been overall quite limited, and it would seem that after a phase of intense research in the first decade of this century, the pace has slowed down, with fewer clinical trials been published in the past 2-3 years. To summarize current evidence: no probiotic has proven successful in Crohn's disease. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, data are more promising, and a very recent meta-analysis, that included 23 randomized controlled trials, concluded that there is evidence of efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in helping inducing and maintaining remission, as well as in maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis. It is fair to state that for both IBD and IBS, more well-designed, rigorous, randomized clinical trials must be performed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telmisartan is an antihypertensive angiotensin II receptor blocker. This antihypertensive shows antiinflammatory activity. PURPOSE: In this study, the antiinflammatory activity of telmisartan was tested in an acetic acid (10%) model of ulcerative colitis (UC) in rats. METHODS: Rats were given 1, 3, and 5mg/kg/day of telmisartan orally for 3 days before induction of UC. The same doses were also administered 2 and 24h after induction. Rats from the non-colitis and non-treated colitis groups were administered vehicle (saline, 5 ml/kg) orally and another group received sulfasalazine (50mg/kg/day). Colons tissue was analyzed by macroscopic, by histopathology, by the immunohistochemical examination of RANKL/RANK pathway; by ELISA analysis of the levels of IL-10, TNF-alpha, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and malonaldehyde (MDA). RESULTS: Telmisartan at 5mg/kg reduced levels of MPO, MDA, TNF-alpha and increased of IL-10 (p<0.05). Additionally, telmisartan reduced macroscopic damage, number of ulcers, and inflammatory and histopathological processes such as neutrophil infiltration, changes in cytoarchitecture, and necrosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed down-regulation of nuclear factor-kappaB receptor/nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANK/RANKL) in groups treated with sulfasalazine or telmisartan. CONCLUSION: Telmisartan exerts beneficial effects in an acetic acid model of colitis in rats. These effects may be due to accelerated termination of the acute inflammatory phase, indicated by decreased TNF-alpha and increased production of IL-10 and low expression of RANKL and RANK.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition. Previous reports suggested that UC may have a worse prognosis when associated with auto-immune diseases. We compared characteristics at diagnosis and natural history of the disease between classical ulcerative colitis (CUC) and UC associated with auto-immune diseases (CAI) in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, 67 children followed for UC at Nancy University Hospital between 1993 and 2012 were included: 45 patients in the CUC group and 22 in the CAI group. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 4.8 years. Median age at diagnosis was 11.6 years in the CAI group and 9.8 years in the CUC group. Time between symptoms onset and diagnosis was broadly similar in the two groups (<3 months) and there were no significant differences regarding biological and histological findings. At 5 years, the need for corticosteroids and azathioprine did not differ between the CAI and the CUC groups. There was also no significant difference between the two groups regarding infliximab use at 1 and 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: In this pediatric study, CAI had similar characteristics at baseline as CUC. The course of CAI does not seem to be influenced by the presence of concomitant auto-immune diseases.},

The role of IL-33 in intestinal inflammation is incompletely understood, with both pro-inflammatory and regulatory properties described. There are also conflicting reports on cellular sources and subcellular location of IL-33 in the colonic mucosa, justifying a closer look at IL-33 expression in well-defined clinical stages of UC. A total of 50 study participants (29 UC patients and 21 healthy controls) were included from a prospective cohort of inflammatory bowel disease patients treated to disease remission with infliximab, a tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) inhibitor. To our knowledge this is the first study examining mucosal IL-33 expression before and after anti-TNF therapy. In colonic mucosal biopsies we found a 3-fold increase in IL-33 gene expression comparing acute UC to healthy controls (p < 0.01). A significant reduction of IL33 between acute UC and disease remission was observed when TNF normalised in the mucosa (p = 0.02). Immunostaining revealed IL-33 in the nuclei of epithelial cells of scattered colonic crypts in acute disease, while at disease remission, IL-33 was undetectable, a novel finding suggesting that enterocyte-derived IL-33 is induced and maintained by inflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulates intestinal inflammation in animal models. Human evidence confirming such modulating influence is limited. We aimed to investigate whether ANS function is associated with inflammatory parameters at disease onset, and whether it predicts the evolution of inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: We prospectively monitored 51 patients from onset of UC for 3 years. Upon remission of the onset flare, ANS activity was assessed by heart rate variability analysis and compared with healthy controls. Inflammatory parameters in blood, stool, and colonic biopsies obtained at onset and during follow-up visits were analyzed. Generalized linear models were used to test cross-sectional associations between ANS activity and inflammatory parameters at onset; linear mixed models were used to test whether ANS function at onset predicted the evolution of inflammation over the following 3 years. KEY RESULTS: Sympathovagal balance was different in UC patients compared to healthy controls, and cross-sectional associated with higher levels of systemic (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], CRP, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma) and mucosal inflammation (interleukin-8, IFN-gamma) at onset. Conversely, a negative cross-sectional association with parasympathetic activity was found for ESR & TNF-alpha. Longitudinally, parasympathetic activity at onset predicted systemic (ESR, WBC), but not mucosal inflammation during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: This study further strengthens the association between the ANS system and intestinal inflammation previously found in animal models and recently in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. These results may have important implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of UC.},

Some of these herbs are also promising agents for the improvement of the gut microbiota and the treatment of ulcerative colitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By screening seven traditional Chinese herbs, we found that Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis were the most effective in promoting the growth of probiotics including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in vitro. We then evaluated the effects of Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis on the growth of the bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella spp.) in vitro. In in vivo experiment, we gavage administrated trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid induced ulcerative colitis (UC) rats with Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis extracts. After two weeks treatment, we analyzed the structure of the gut microbiota and examined the UC symptoms by employing qPCR and animal pathology detection techniques. RESULTS: Both Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis promoted the growth of probiotics - Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in vitro. Red Ginseng also inhibited the growth of some pathogen strains. In vivo, Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis improved the structure of gut microbiota and relieved the symptoms of ulcerative colitis in vivo. Compared with Semen Coicis, Red Ginseng was more effective in relieving the symptoms of ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Red Ginseng could promote the growth of probiotic bacteria in vitro. Red Ginseng and, to a lesser extent Semen Coicis, gave positive results in an experimental in vivo model for ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the colonic mucosa. Administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to animals is a frequently used model to mimic human colitis. Deregulation of the immune response to the enteric microflora or pathogens as well as increased intestinal permeability have been proposed as disease-driving mechanisms. To enlarge the understanding of the pathogenesis, we have studied the effect of DSS on the immune system and gut microbiota in mice. Intestinal inflammation was verified through histological evaluation and myeloperoxidase activity. Immunological changes were assessed by flow cytometry in spleen, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes and through multiplex cytokine profiling. In addition, quantification of the total amount of bacteria on colonic mucosa as well as the total amount of lactobacilli, Akkermansia, Desulfovibrio and Enterobacteriaceae was performed by the use of quantitative PCR. Diversity and community structure were analysed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) patterns, and principal component analysis was utilized on immunological and T-RFLP patterns. DSS-induced colitis show clinical and histological similarities to UC. The composition of the colonic microflora was profoundly changed and correlated with several alterations of the immune system. The results demonstrate a relationship between multiple immunological changes and alterations of the gut microbiota after DSS administration. These data highlight and improve the definition of the immunological basis of the disease and suggest a role for dysregulation of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of colitis.},

   abstract = {Intestinal permeability plays a critical role in the etiopathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. Defensins, including porcine beta-defensin (pBD)2, are crucial antimicrobial peptides for gut protection owing to their antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of pBD2 on mucosal injury and the disruption of the epithelial barrier during the pathological process of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. The effects and mechanism of pBD2 were evaluated both using a DSS-induced C57BL/6 mouse model and, in vitro, using Caco-2 and RAW264.7 cells. DSS-induced colitis was characterized by higher disease activity index, shortened colon length, elevated activities of myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase, histologic evidence of inflammation, and increased expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8. pBD2 increased the expression of zonula occludens-1, zonula occludens-2, claudin-1, mucin-1, and mucin-2 mRNA and proteins, and it decreased permeability to FITC-D, as well as apoptosis, in DSS-treated mice. pBD2 also decreased inflammatory infiltrates of the colon epithelium. In Caco-2 cells, pBD2 increased transepithelial electrical resistance and mucin mRNA expression, and it decreased the permeability of FITC-D while preserving the structural integrity of the tight junctions. The effects of pBD2 appeared to be through upregulation of the expression of genes associated with tight junctions and mucins, and by suppressing DSS-induced increases in inflammation, inducible NO synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and apoptosis. These results show that pBD2 improves DSS-induced changes in mucosal lesions and paracellular permeability, possibly by affecting the activation of NF-kappaB signaling. The present study demonstrates that intrarectal administration of pBD2 may be a novel preventive option for ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children with congenital malformations, mental retardation, and complex early medical history frequently have feeding problems. Although tube feeding is effective in providing the necessary energy and nutrients, it decreases the child's motivation to eat and may lead to oral aversion. In this study, we sought to confirm our previous results, showing that a multidisciplinary clinical hunger provocation program may lead to quick resumption of oral feeding. METHODS: In a crossover study, 22 children of 9 to 24 months of age who were fully dependent on tube feeding were randomly assigned to one of two groups: group A, intervention group (2-week multidisciplinary clinical hunger provocation program); and group B, control group (4-week outpatient treatment by the same multidisciplinary team). Patients failing one treatment were reassigned to the other treatment group. Primary outcome measures were at least 75% orally fed at the conclusion of the intervention and fully orally fed and gaining weight 6 months after the intervention. RESULTS: In group A, 9/11 patients were successfully weaned from tube feeding (2 failures: 1 developed ulcerative colitis, 1 drop-out). In group B, only 1 patient was weaned successfully; 10/11 were reassigned to the clinical hunger provocation program, all being weaned successfully. Six months after the intervention, 1 patient had to resume tube feeding. In total, in the control group, 1/11 (9%) was weaned successfully as compared with 18/21 (86%) in the hunger provocation group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary clinical hunger provocation is an effective short-term intervention for weaning young children from tube feeding.},

We aimed to study food intake in children with IBD and evaluated the relation of dietary intake with disease activity and nutritional status in these children. METHODS: This cross-sectional study investigated 68 children and adolescents with IBD (57 Crohn disease, 11 ulcerative colitis). Evaluation included clinical, laboratory, and nutritional assessment including 3 days diet record. RESULTS: Compared with recommended daily allowance, the intake of patients with IBD was significantly poor for carbohydrates (75%, P = 0.016), calcium (49%, P < 0.05), magnesium (76%, P < 0.05), vitamin A (72%, P < 0.05), vitamin E (57%, P < 0.05), and fiber (44%, P < 0.05) and higher for protein (175%, P < 0.05), iron (112%, P < 0.05), and water-soluble vitamins (118%-189% P < 0.05). Compared with the intakes of healthy children from National Nutritional Survey, the intake of IBD group was lower for calories (78%, P = 0.012), carbohydrates (61% P < 0.05), magnesium (67% P < 0.05), vitamin C (34%, P < 0.05), and fiber (54%, P < 0.05) and high for B12 (141%, P < 0.05). Fifty subjects ate ordinary diets, 7 of 68 children were on exclusive enteral nutrition and 11 of 68 consumed regular food with different polymeric formulas supplements. Compared with children without supplements, children on exclusive enteral nutrition and nutritional supplements (18/68) had significantly better intakes of energy (1870 +/- 755 vs 2267 +/- 432, P < 0.05), carbohydrates (223 +/- 97 vs 292 +/- 99, P < 0.05), and all minerals (P < 0.05) and micronutrients (P < 0.05). Dietary intake was not different by disease status (remission or relapse). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of nutritional supplements, food intake is inadequate for many nutrients in many children with IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The interaction between a disturbed microbial composition, the intestinal mucosal barrier and the mucosal immune system plays an important role in IBD and its chronicity. It has been indicated that due to the altered microbial composition the balance between T regulatory cells (Treg) and T helper cells (Th) 17 is disturbed, leading to an inflammatory state. The present study shows that oral intake of a specific multi fibre mix (MF), designed to match the fibre content of a healthy diet, counteracts IBD-like intestinal inflammation and weight loss in dextran sodium sulphate treated mice. This reduction in inflammation might be brought about, at least in part, by the MF-induced decrease in inflammatory cytokines, increase in IL-10 and the relative increase in Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Moreover, the Treg percentage in the MLN correlates with the percentage of tolerogenic lamina propria derived CD103+RALDH+dendritic cells in the MLN, suggesting that these play a role in the observed effects. In children with CD exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a widely used safe and effective therapy. Optimizing enteral nutritional concepts with the tested fibre mix, know to modulate the gut microbiota composition, SCFA production and inflammatory status (as indicated by the present study) could possibly further improve efficacy in inducing remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial treatment is known to cause short- and long-term changes in the composition of normal human microbiota. The relationship between antibiotic use and overall clinical behavior in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been explored. We aim to prospectively characterize patterns of antibiotic use and clinical IBD activity in a large IBD cohort. METHODS: Prospective observational study from a longitudinal IBD natural history registry between 2009 and 2012. Antibiotic prescriptions were identified and categorized using electronic medical record data. Cumulative rates over the 4-year study period were compared. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, health care utilization, and treatment data of the patients with IBD were collected and analyzed. Quality of life was measured by Short IBD Questionnaire data. Primary outcomes were markers of disease activity including Short IBD Questionnaire scores, C-reactive protein levels, health care utilization, and medication use. RESULTS: Seven hundred eighteen patients followed over 4 years were included (47.6% male; mean age, 46.7 +/- 15.2 yr), 59.9% had Crohn's disease, whereas 38.6% had ulcerative colitis. Most patients (66.3%) were exposed to antibiotics during the study period. Antibiotic-exposed patients were more likely to have Crohn's disease (63% versus 53.7%; P = 0.05), require narcotics (43.7% versus 14.9%; P < 0.0001), receive antidepressants (43.1% versus 18.6%; P < 0.001), prednisone (52.7% versus 31%; P < 0.0001), or biological therapy (52% versus 36.5%; P < 0.0001). Antibiotic-exposed patients had a lower mean Short IBD Questionnaire (50.2 +/- 11.5 versus 56.4 +/- 9.5; P < 0.0001), higher rates of C-reactive protein elevation (49.2% versus 31.8%; P < 0.0001), and higher health care utilization compared with nonantibiotic-exposed patients. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with IBD receive antibiotic treatment, and these individuals demonstrate a more severe clinical course.},

   abstract = {Many patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), whether Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, are of reproductive age. Young women with IBD are usually very worried about their fertility, the activity of their disease during pregnancy, the heritability of the disease to their unborn child, and the effect of their underlying IBD on the pregnancy itself. Additionally, patients express concerns about using IBD medications during pregnancy, fearing that the medications may negatively affect the fetus. For this reason, it is of the utmost importance that gastroenterologists and patients with IBD be aware of the effect of IBD on pregnancy, the effect of pregnancy on IBD, and the effect of IBD medications on the fetus and on pregnancy outcomes. Increasing the awareness of patients with IBD about the importance of maintaining disease remission at the time of conception and throughout pregnancy is key to improving the outcomes of both mothers and fetuses. This article addresses the fertility of patients with IBD, the effect of pregnancy on disease activity, and the effect of IBD on pregnancy. Also discussed are which IBD medications can be used during conception and pregnancy and which medications must be avoided.},

GOAL: To investigate the combined role of all the above factors in the burden of fatigue among IBD patients. STUDY: We conducted an observational study of adult patients enrolled in an IBD clinical research registry at a tertiary care clinic. Fatigue burden was defined by Item 1 of the Short-form IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ), which is scored on a 7-point Likert scale. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) disease activity were measured with the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or the UC Activity Index, respectively. Labs were obtained to assess anemia, vitamin deficiencies, and inflammatory markers. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Use of psychotropic medications and narcotics was used as proxy measure of psychopathology and pain. RESULTS: Among 685 IBD patients enrolled in the registry, 631 (238 UC, 393 CD) had a complete SIBDQ. High fatigue burden was found in 57.5% of patients (64.4% CD, 46.2% UC). Fatigue burden was significantly associated with sleep disturbance (PSQI), SIBDQ, and disease activity. CD patients had more fatigue burden than UC patients. Multivariate regression showed that poor quality of life, sleep disturbance, and being on a psychotropic medication are significantly associated with fatigue burden for both UC and CD. CONCLUSION: Because fatigue is common in IBD patients, these findings suggest that attention to quality of sleep and psychopathology is as important as medical disease management.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of modern medical management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on surgical necessity and outcomes remains unclear. We hypothesized that surgery rates have decreased while outcomes have worsened due to operating on "sicker" patients since the introduction of biologic medications. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample and ICD-9-CM codes were used to identify inpatient admissions for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Trends in IBD nutrition, surgeries, and postoperative complications were determined. RESULTS: There were 191,743 admissions for IBD during the study period. Surgery rates were largely unchanged over the study period, ranging from 9 to 12 % of admissions in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The rate of poor nutrition increased by 67 % in ulcerative colitis and by 83 % in Crohn's disease. Rates of postoperative anastomotic leak (10.2-13.9 %) were unchanged over the years. Postoperative infection rates decreased by 17 % in Crohn's disease (18 % in 2003 to 15 % in 2012; P < 0.001) but did not show a trend in any direction in ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of IBD surgery have remained stable while postoperative infectious complications have remained stable or decreased since the implementation of biologic therapies. We identified an increase in poor nutrition in surgical patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Defects in intestinal innate defense systems predispose patients to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases in the mucosal barrier maintain gut homeostasis and defend against pathogenic attack. We hypothesized that molecular genetic defects in intestinal NADPH oxidases might be present in children with IBD. METHODS: After targeted exome sequencing of epithelial NADPH oxidases NOX1 and DUOX2 on 209 children with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD), the identified mutations were validated using Sanger Sequencing. A structural analysis of NOX1 and DUOX2 variants was performed by homology in silico modeling. The functional characterization included ROS generation in model cell lines and in in vivo transduced murine crypts, protein expression, intracellular localization, and cell-based infection studies with the enteric pathogens Campylobacter jejuni and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. RESULTS: We identified missense mutations in NOX1 (c.988G>A, p.Pro330Ser; c.967G>A, p.Asp360Asn) and DUOX2 (c.4474G>A, p.Arg1211Cys; c.3631C>T, p.Arg1492Cys) in 5 of 209 VEOIBD patients. The NOX1 p.Asp360Asn variant was replicated in a male Ashkenazi Jewish ulcerative colitis cohort. All NOX1 and DUOX2 variants showed reduced ROS production compared with wild-type enzymes. Despite appropriate cellular localization and comparable pathogen-stimulated translocation of altered oxidases, cells harboring NOX1 or DUOX2 variants had defective host resistance to infection with C. jejuni. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies the first inactivating missense variants in NOX1 and DUOX2 associated with VEOIBD. Defective ROS production from intestinal epithelial cells constitutes a risk factor for developing VEOIBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant. Patients with pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) differ from adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease with regard to phenotype, inflammatory profile, and treatment response. We hypothesized that variations in CRP and CRP genotype influence PIBD phenotype, natural history, and remission after anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy. METHODS: Six single nucleotide polymorphisms tagging CRP (rs1935193, rs1130864, rs1205, rs1417938, rs11265263, and rs1800947) were genotyped in 465 patients with PIBD (diagnosed <17 yr). Phenotyping was serially performed until last follow-up and serum CRP levels recorded at diagnosis and before biological therapy in a subgroup. RESULTS: CRP haplotype (ATGCTC) differed in those diagnosed <10 years, with rs1205T more frequent in Crohn's disease (CD) than ulcerative colitis (UC) (P = 0.009); the haplotype ATGCTC was less frequent in UC (P = 0.002). Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1205, rs1130864, and rs1417938) showed association with elevated CRP levels at diagnosis. CRP genotype had no association with CD phenotype or natural history. CRP was more frequently raised at diagnosis in CD than UC (63% versus 22%, P < 0.0001). Elevated CRP at diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of progression to surgery in patients with CD (P < 0.0001) and the need for azathioprine in the overall PIBD cohort (P = 0.002). There was no effect of CRP genotype or serum CRP on the achievement of remission using anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy. CONCLUSIONS: CRP and CRP genotype differ between pediatric patients with CD and UC with a high inflammatory burden at diagnosis suggesting a worse prognosis. Additional evaluation of CRP in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis and natural history is now warranted.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the colon and rectum, resulting from a dysregulated immune response towards intraluminal antigens in a genetically predisposed host. The disease has a varying extent and severity. Approximately 20% of patients with ulcerative colitis experience a severe flare during the course of their disease, requiring hospitalization. Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is potentially a life-threatening condition that requires early recognition, hospitalization, correction of body fluids and electrolytes, and nutritional support if needed. Superimposed bacterial or viral infections need to be excluded and thromboprophylaxis should be started. Intravenous corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for this condition. Rescue treatment with ciclosporin or infliximab is indicated in patients who do not sufficiently respond to corticosteroids after 3-5 days, with close monitoring of the patients' symptoms, serum C-reactive protein and albumin levels. If medical therapy fails, timely colectomy should be performed to prevent critical complications. In this article, we review all relevant aspects of ASUC, from its pathophysiological background to modern management in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Natural history of paediatric-onset ulcerative proctitis (UP) is poorly described. Our aim was to describe the phenotype and disease course of incident UP in a population-based study of paediatric-onset UC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with UC diagnosed <17 years from 1988 to 2004, and followed during >2 years have been extracted from a population-based registry. UC location was defined according to the Paris classification. Cumulative risks for use of immunosuppressants (IS), anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) therapy, colonic extension and colectomy were described using Kaplan-Meier method. Risk factors for colonic extension were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: 158 patients with paediatric-onset UC (91 females) with a median age at diagnosis of 14.5 years (Q1: 11.4-Q3: 16.1) have been identified and followed during a median of 11.4 years (8.2-15.8). Among them, 25% had UP (E1) at diagnosis and 49% of them presented a colonic extension at maximal follow-up. In these children, the cumulative risk for colonic extension was 10% at 1 year, 45% at 5 years and 52% at 10 years. No parameter at diagnosis was associated with colonic extension in the UP (E1 group). IS use was significantly lower in patients with UP than in those with E2, E3 or E4 location (p=0.049). For the UP cohort, the cumulative risk for colectomy was 3% at 1 year, 10% at 5 years, 13% at 10 years and 13% at 15 years. Risks for colonic extension, treatment with anti-TNF-alpha and colectomy did not differ between the E1 group and the E2-E3-E4 group. CONCLUSIONS: UP is frequent in paediatric-onset UC and should not be considered as a minor disease. Compared with more extensive UC locations, risks for colonic extension, anti-TNF-alpha therapy and colectomy were similar in UP, whereas the risk for use of IM was lower.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Low serum trough levels (TLs) of infliximab (IFX) and antibodies to IFX (ATIs) are associated with the loss of therapeutic response in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving IFX. Until now, pediatric data are scarce. Therefore, we aimed to cross-sectionally investigate the association between ATIs and IFX TLs, and clinical and biochemical disease activity in children receiving IFX for IBD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children aged <18 years receiving IFX maintenance treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) at three Dutch hospitals were included. Prior to two consecutive IFX infusions, IFX TLs and ATI levels were measured. Clinical disease activity was determined by Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI), for CD and UC, respectively. Biochemical disease activity was assessed by serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FC). Clinical remission was defined as a PUCAI or PCDAI score of <10. Therapeutic range of IFX was considered 3-7 microg/ml. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were included (31 CD; 16 females). Median age was 15 years. Median IFX TL was 3.5 microg/ml [IQR 2-7]. Subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic TLs were found in 38% and 23% of children, respectively. ATIs were detected in four patients. A correlation was found between IFX TL and CRP [rs = -0.51; p < 0.01] and FC [rs = -0.49; p < 0.01]. However, when only clinical disease activity was considered, no difference in median TL was found between remission and active disease (resp. 3.5 microg/ml [IQR 2-5] and 2.3 microg/ml [IQR 0.3-4.6]; p = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: IFX TLs are related to biochemical markers of disease activity. This could provide a rationale for monitoring TLs in children receiving IFX for IBD.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: In adult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, there is a strong discrepancy between symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation. Data on pediatric IBD patients are conflicting. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the relationship between clinical symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation in pediatric IBD. Patients aged <18 years with previously diagnosed Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) were included. Clinical disease activity was determined using the abbreviated Pediatric CD Activity Index (aPCDAI) or Pediatric UC Activity Index (PUCAI). Biochemical disease activity was assessed using fecal calprotectin (FC) and C-reactive protein (CRP). In total, 127 patients (62 male; median age 14.9 years) were included (82 CD, 45 UC). FC correlated weakly with total aPCDAI score (r s = 0.32; 95 % CI 0.12-0.51; p = 0.003) and total PUCAI score (r s = 0.36; 95 % CI 0.07-0.62; p = 0.015). Only aPCDAI components abdominal examination and perirectal disease and PUCAI component activity level had a significant correlation with levels of FC. CRP correlated weakly with total aPCDAI score (r s = 0.28; 95 % CI 0.05-0.46; p = 0.012) and aPCDAI components abdominal examination and activity level. No significant correlation was observed between CRP and total PUCAI score (r s = 0.01; 95 % CI -0.34-0.29; p = 0.961) or individual PUCAI components. CONCLUSION: There is a strong discrepancy between clinical symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation in children with IBD. WHAT IS KNOWN: * A substantial proportion of asymptomatic pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients have elevated biomarkers of inflammation. * There is a strong discrepancy between symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation in adults with IBD. What is New: * Clinical symptoms are only weakly associated with levels of fecal calprotectin and serum C-reactive protein in children and adolescents with previously diagnosed IBD. * Similarly to adult IBD patients, there is a strong discrepancy between clinical symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation in children with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet and body composition play unclear roles in the pathogenesis, activity and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Evidence-based guidance regarding dietary modification in IBD is lacking. We aimed to determine the attitudes of IBD patients and clinicians to diet. METHODS: The present cross-sectional study comprised an online questionnaire distributed to members of a national IBD patient organisation, assessing demographics, anthropometry, disease phenotype and dietary beliefs. Dietitians, gastroenterologists and surgeons were targeted for a similar questionnaire as a result of membership of national professional bodies. RESULTS: Nine hundred and twenty-eight patients (72.2% female; mean age 39.5 years; age range 5-91 years) responded. Two-thirds of the patients had Crohn's disease. The mean reported body mass index was 24.9 kg m-2 and was significantly skewed to the right. Patients who had taken >10 courses of steroids were had a greater probability of being overweight or obese, independent of disease complications. Most patients (71%) assumed that their diet affected their IBD; 61% considered their IBD specialist disregarded the importance of diet. Of the 136 clinicians who responded, the majority felt that diet was a factor in symptoms and intestinal microbiota. More gastroenterologists (44%) than dietitians (17%) considered that diet had a role in the pathogenesis of IBD (P = 0.003). Twenty-six percent of patients reported receiving dietary advice from their IBD specialist, whereas 98% of gastroenterologists reported advice provision. Patients received diverse advice. Half of the patients followed recommendations provided by a clinician. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that IBD patients consider diet to be important in their disease. IBD clinicians from different disciplines have diverse views of the role of diet. Advice given to patients is heterogeneous, often perceived as inadequate and poorly followed.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recent research suggests a relationship of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and depression. Our objective was to evaluate for improvement of depressive symptoms with treatment of IBD using immunosuppressive medications. METHODS: A retrospective study of consecutive patients with IBD started on immunosuppressive agents [anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) or immunomodulator therapy] was conducted. Patients were evaluated if disease activity indices using Harvey Bradshaw Index for Crohn's disease (CD) and Simple Clinical Colitis Disease Activity Index for ulcerative colitis (UC) and depressive indices using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores were obtained before and at least 30 days after initiation of therapy. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with UC and 53 patients with CD (all with active disease symptoms) were evaluated over a 60 day median follow-up evaluation (range 30, 140 days). Twenty-two patients started on immunomodulator therapy, and 47 patients started on anti-TNF therapy. Crohn's disease patients had significantly decreased PHQ-9 scores at follow-up [median 9 (range 3, 14) to 4 (1, 8)], with significant decreases only in those started on anti-TNF therapy. Changes in PHQ-9 and CRP were correlated (rho = 0.38, p < 0.05). In patients with UC, PHQ-9 scores [5 (3, 9) to 2 (0, 5)] were significantly decreased. Percentage at risk of moderate to severe depression (PHQ-9 scores >/=10) was lower after treatment [Crohn's disease 51-18 % (p < 0.05), ulcerative colitis 18-0 %]. CONCLUSION: Depressive scores decreased significantly in patients with IBD treated with immunosuppressive therapy and the number at risk for moderate to severe depression improved significantly.},

   abstract = {This study evaluated whether dietary resistant starch (RS) and green tea extract (GTE), which have anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties, protect against colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) using a rat model, also investigated potential mechanisms of action of these agents including their effects on the gut microbiota. Rats were fed a control diet or diets containing 10% RS, 0.5% GTE or a combination of the two (RS + GTE). CAC was initiated with 2 weekly azoxymethane (AOM) injections (10mg/kg) followed by 2% dextran sodium sulphate in drinking water for 7 days after 2 weeks on diets. Rats were killed 20 weeks after the first AOM. Colon tissues and tumours were examined for histopathology by H&E, gene/protein expression by PCR and immunohistochemistry and digesta for analyses of fermentation products and microbiota populations. RS and RS + GTE (but not GTE) diets significantly (P< 0.05) decreased tumour multiplicity and adenocarcinoma formation, relative to the control diet. Effects of RS + GTE were not different from RS alone. RS diet caused significant shifts in microbial composition/diversity, with increases in Parabacteroides, Barnesiella, Ruminococcus, Marvinbryantia and Bifidobacterium as primary contributors to the shift. RS-containing diets increased short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and expression of the SCFA receptor GPR43 mRNA, and reduced inflammation (COX-2, NF-kB, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA) and cell proliferation P< 0.05. GTE had no effect. This is the first study that demonstrates chemopreventive effects of RS (but not GTE) in a rodent CAC model, suggesting RS might have benefit to patients with ulcerative colitis who are at an increased risk of developing CRC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has familial aggregation in African Americans (AAs), but little is known about the molecular genetic susceptibility. Mapping studies using the Immunochip genotyping array expand the number of susceptibility loci for IBD in Caucasians to 163, but the contribution of the 163 loci and European admixture to IBD risk in AAs is unclear. We performed a genetic mapping study using the Immunochip to determine whether IBD susceptibility loci in Caucasians also affect risk in AAs and identify new associated loci. METHODS: We recruited AAs with IBD and without IBD (controls) from 34 IBD centers in the United States; additional controls were collected from 4 other Immunochip studies. Association and admixture loci were mapped for 1088 patients with Crohn's disease, 361 with ulcerative colitis, 62 with IBD type unknown, and 1797 controls; 130,241 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed. RESULTS: The strongest associations were observed between ulcerative colitis and HLA rs9271366 (P = 7.5 x 10(-6)), Crohn's disease and 5p13.1 rs4286721 (P = 3.5 x 10(-6)), and IBD and KAT2A rs730086 (P = 2.3 x 10(-6)). Additional suggestive associations (P < 4.2 x 10(-5)) were observed between Crohn's disease and IBD and African-specific SNPs in STAT5A and STAT3; between IBD and SNPs in IL23R, IL12B, and C2orf43; and between ulcerative colitis and SNPs near HDAC11 and near LINC00994. The latter 3 loci have not been previously associated with IBD, but require replication. Established Caucasian associations were replicated in AAs (P < 3.1 x 10(-4)) at NOD2, IL23R, 5p15.3, and IKZF3. Significant admixture (P < 3.9 x 10(-4)) was observed for 17q12-17q21.31 (IZKF3 through STAT3), 10q11.23-10q21.2, 15q22.2-15q23, and 16p12.2-16p12.1. Network analyses showed significant enrichment (false discovery rate <1 x 10(-5)) in genes that encode members of the JAK-STAT, cytokine, and chemokine signaling pathways, as well those involved in pathogenesis of measles. CONCLUSIONS: In a genetic analysis of 3308 AA IBD cases and controls, we found that many variants associated with IBD in Caucasians also showed association evidence with these diseases in AAs; we also found evidence for variants and loci not previously associated with IBD. The complex genetic factors that determine risk for or protection against IBD in different populations require further study.},

   abstract = {GOALS: It can be important to exclude infectious etiologies prior to adjusting immunosuppressive therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) exacerbation. We sought to determine the diagnostic yield of routine infectious stool studies in pediatric UC patients. PROCEDURES: We conducted a retrospective review of 152 pediatric UC patients at Texas Children's Hospital between January 2003 and December 2009. The patient records were followed through July 2014. The number and type of infectious stool studies performed and the results of those were collected. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-four diagnostic stool tests were conducted for Clostridium difficile; 13.6% were positive. Two hundred twenty stool bacterial cultures were performed, and 1.8% were positive, all growing non-typhoid Salmonella. One of 13 (7.7%) Adenovirus PCR tests was positive. Two of 152 examinations (1.3%) for Ova and Parasites were positive. No stool tests for viral culture, viral particles, Yersinia or Rotavirus were positive. CONCLUSIONS: Clostridium difficile infection is common in pediatric UC, and routine screening during flares is strongly recommended. Other bacterial and parasitic infections routinely tested for are uncommon, but Salmonella may be a potentially important attribute to disease exacerbations in select patients. In patients without co-morbid conditions, the utility of performing non-specific fecal viral tests is questionable.},

Thirteen patients (10 men, 3 women; mean age, 36.5 years) with ulcerative colitis admitted to the Shiga University Hospital were enrolled in this study. We measured the resting energy expenditure and respiratory quotients of these patients before and after induction therapy with indirect calorimetry. We analyzed the changes of nutritional status and serum inflammatory cytokine levels and also evaluated the relationship between energy metabolism and disease activity by using the Seo index and Lichtiger index. The resting energy expenditure was 26.3 +/- 3.8 kcal/kg/day in the active stage and significantly decreased to 23.5 +/- 2.4 kcal/kg/day after induction therapy (p<0.01). The resting energy expenditure changed in parallel with the disease activity index and C-reactive protein and inflammatory cytokine levels. The respiratory quotient significantly increased after induction therapy. Thus, moderate to severe ulcerative colitis patients had a hyper-metabolic status, and the energy metabolism of these patients significantly changed after induction therapy. Therefore, we recommend that nutritional management with 30-34 kcal/kg/day (calculated as measured resting energy expenditure x activity factor, 1.3) may be optimal for hospitalized ulcerative colitis patients.},

   abstract = {In the recent decades the rapid development of the studies on new methods used in diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and monitoring the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases has been observed. To the diagnostics of gastrointestinal disorders new methods such as endoscopic capsule and imaging methods including magnetic resonance have been introduced. Markers of inflammation detected in stool play significant role in the diagnostics. To the best known belong calprotectine and lactoferrin, which are produced by neutral granulocytes. In the present review we have presented the clinical usefulness of detection in the stool of calprotectin, lectoferrin, S100A12 protein and pyruvate kinase. Clinical usefulness of these markers were used in diagnosis, assessment of the treatment results, disease relapse and mucosal healing in inflammatory bowel disease. Determination of fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in the process of mucosal healing in ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease are of particular value. Confirmation of these results in multicenter prospective trials will enable in the future to reduce the number of control colonoscopies, which in children are performer under general anesthesia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the major forms of inflammatory bowel disease, and pathogenesis involves a complex interplay among genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. We evaluated isoform expression of the IL-12-activated transcription factor STAT4 in children with CD and UC. METHODS: We collected biopsy samples from both patients newly diagnosed with CD and with UC. We further collected blood samples from patients newly diagnosed with CD and with UC as well as from patients who had a flare-up after being in clinical remission, and we examined the ratios of STAT4beta/STAT4alpha mRNA. In addition to STAT4 isoforms, we measured the expression of the cytokines TNFalpha, IFNgamma, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and IL-17 using polymerase chain reaction of biopsy samples and multiplex analysis of patient serum samples. RESULTS: Ratios of STAT4beta/STAT4alpha were increased in specific gastrointestinal tract segments in both patients with CD and those with UC that correlate with the location and severity of inflammation. In contrast, we did not observe changes in STAT4beta/STAT4alpha ratios in biopsy specimens from patients with eosinophilic esophagitis. We also observed increased STAT4beta/STAT4alpha ratios in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with UC and those with CD, compared with healthy controls. Ratios were normalized after patients were treated with steroids. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data indicate that STAT4 isoforms could be an important noninvasive biomarker in the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and that expression of these isoforms might provide further insight into the pathogenesis of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In the past decades, treatment options and strategies for ulcerative colitis [UC] have radically changed. Whether these developments have altered the disease outcome at population level is yet unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the disease outcome of UC over the past two decades in the South-Limburg area of The Netherlands. METHODS: In the Dutch population-based IBDSL cohort, three time cohorts were defined: cohort 1991-1997 [cohort A], cohort 1998-2005 [cohort B], and cohort 2006-2010 [cohort C]. The colectomy and hospitalisation rates were compared between cohorts by Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Hazard ratios [HR] for early colectomy [within 6 months after diagnosis], late colectomy [beyond 6 months after diagnosis], and hospitalisation were calculated using Cox regression models. RESULTS: In total, 476 UC patients were included in cohort A, 587 patients in cohort B, and 598 patients in cohort C. Over time, an increase in the use of immunomodulators [8.1%, 22.8% and 21.7%, respectively, p < 0.01] and biological agents [0%, 4.3% and 10.6%, respectively, p < 0.01] was observed. The early colectomy rate decreased from 1.5% in cohort A to 0.5% in cohort B [HR 0.14; 95% confidence interval 0.04-0.47], with no further decrease in cohort C [0.3%, HR 0.98; 95% confidence interval 0.20-4.85]. Late colectomy rate remained unchanged over time [4.0% vs 5.2% vs 3.6%, respectively, p = 0.54]. Hospitalisation rate was also similar among cohorts [22.3% vs 19.5% vs 18.3%, respectively, p = 0.10]. CONCLUSION: Over the past two decades, a reduction in early colectomy rate was observed, with no further reduction in the most recent era. Late colectomy rate and hospitalisation rate remained unchanged over time.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elderly onset (EO) inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may become a more common entity as a result of population aging and the rising IBD incidence. Its management is challenging, because of multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and frailty. Insight into the long-term outcome is essential for optimal patient counseling and treatment. We studied the incidence and disease outcome of elderly-onset IBD in direct comparison to adult-onset (AO) IBD. METHODS: All 2823 cases with IBD from the Dutch population-based IBD South Limburg cohort, diagnosed between 1991 and 2011, were included. Long-term outcome (hospitalization, surgery, and disease phenotype) was compared between AO (<60 years at diagnosis) and EO (>/=60 years at diagnosis) disease, for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) separately. RESULTS: In total, 1162 patients with CD (136 EO/1026 AO) and 1661 patients with UC (373 EO/1288 AO) were included. The EO IBD incidence increased from 11.71 per 100,000 persons in 1991 to 23.66 per 100,000 persons in 2010, P < 0.01. Immunomodulators were less often used in EO CD (61.8% versus 77.1%, P = 0.03) and EO UC (22.8% versus 35.4%, P < 0.01), even as biologicals (25.1% versus 55.1%, P = 0.03 and 7.8% versus 18.0%, P < 0.01, respectively). No differences were observed in surgery risk (CD: hazard ratio [HR] 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-1.67 and UC: HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.53-1.46), or in CD phenotype progression (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.52-1.25), but more patients with EO UC required hospitalization (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.01-1.63). CONCLUSIONS: EO IBD is rising, warranting physicians' alertness for IBD in elderly patients. The long-term outcome was not different from AO disease, despite a less frequent use of immunomodulators and biologicals.},

   abstract = {Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare progressive disorder leading to bile duct destruction; approximately 75% of patients have comorbid inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We undertook the largest genome-wide association study of PSC (4,796 cases and 19,955 population controls) and identified four new genome-wide significant loci. The most associated SNP at one locus affects splicing and expression of UBASH3A, with the protective allele (C) predicted to cause nonstop-mediated mRNA decay and lower expression of UBASH3A. Further analyses based on common variants suggested that the genome-wide genetic correlation (rG) between PSC and ulcerative colitis (UC) (rG = 0.29) was significantly greater than that between PSC and Crohn's disease (CD) (rG = 0.04) (P = 2.55 x 10-15). UC and CD were genetically more similar to each other (rG = 0.56) than either was to PSC (P < 1.0 x 10-15). Our study represents a substantial advance in understanding of the genetics of PSC.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a heterogeneous group of chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal conditions with variable disease courses often requiring significant healthcare expenditures. We aimed to identify disease trajectory patterns based on longitudinal financial expenditures and to assess the association of classic disease activity parameters with financial charges. METHODS: This was an analysis of a consented, prospective, natural history IBD registry (2009-2013) from a tertiary IBD center of 2,203 patients and their associated medical charges excluding pharmacy expenses. We applied group-based trajectory modeling to longitudinal healthcare financial charges to determine patterns of charges. We assessed the association between charge patterns and disease activity, quality of life, healthcare utilization, and medication requirement. RESULTS: The final model included 1,600 IBD patients with 5-year charges. We identified six distinct trajectories over the study period. Consistently High charges were associated with Crohn's disease (66.0% Consistently High patients, P<0.01), perianal involvement (22.6%, P<0.01), ulcerative colitis extent (89.7% extensive, P=0.01), prior IBD surgery (52.5%, P<0.01), and depression/anxiety (36.2%, P<0.01). Compared with other trajectories, Consistently High charges had higher 5-year disease activity indices (Harvey-Bradshaw P<0.01; ulcerative colitis activity index P<0.01), elevated C-reactive protein rates (72.3%, P<0.01), IBD surgery (64.5%, P<0.01), hospitalization (97.2%, P<0.01), corticosteroid (70.9%, P<0.01) and antitumor necrosis factor requirement (50.4%, P<0.01), and worse quality of life (P<0.01). Annual trends in parameters were reflected in temporal changes in financial charges. The majority of financial burden stemmed from inpatient care. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare financial charges represent a novel phenotype in IBD that reflect trends in classic disease activity parameters and allow for subgroup identification of temporal disease trajectories.},

   abstract = {OPINION STATEMENT: A substantial and growing proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are elderly, and these patients require tailored treatment strategies. However, significant challenges exist in the management of this population due to the paucity of data. Establishing the initial diagnosis and assessing the etiology of future symptoms and flares can be challenging as several other prevalent diseases can masquerade as IBD, such as ischemic colitis, diverticular disease, and infectious colitis. Important pharmacologic considerations include reduced glomerular filtration rate and drug-drug interactions in the elderly. No drug therapy is absolutely contraindicated in this population; however, special risk and benefit assessments should be made. Older patients are more susceptible to side effects of steroids such as delirium, fractures, and cataracts. Budesonide can be an appropriate alternative for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) as it has limited systemic absorption. Pill size and quantity, nephrotoxicity, and difficulty of administration of rectal preparations should be considered with 5-aminosalicylic (5-ASA) therapy. Biologics are very effective, but modestly increase the risk of infection in a susceptible group. Based on their mechanisms, integrin receptor antagonists (e.g., vedolizumab) may reduce these risks. Use of antibiotics for anorectal or fistulizing CD or pouchitis in UC increases the risk of Clostridium difficile infection. Pre-existing comorbidities, functional status, and nutrition are important indicators of surgical outcomes. Morbidity and mortality are increased among IBD patients undergoing surgery, often due to postoperative complications or sepsis. Elderly adults with IBD, particularly UC, have very high rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Colonoscopy appears safe, but the optimal surveillance interval has not been well defined. Should the octogenarian, nonagenarian, and centurion undergo colonoscopy? The length of surveillance should likely account for the individual's overall life expectancy. Specific health maintenance should emphasize administering non-live vaccines to patients on thiopurines or biologics and regular skin exams for those on thiopurines. Smoking cessation is crucial to overall health and response to medical therapy, even among UC patients. This article will review management of IBD in the elderly.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms (GI) compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are common in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission. The causes of these symptoms remain to be clarified. Our aim was to investigate prevalence and factors associated with IBS-like symptoms in patients with UC in deep remission. METHODS: We included 298 patients with UC and used Mayo score, sigmoidoscopy, and fecal calprotectin to define deep remission versus active disease. Presence of IBS-like symptoms according to the Rome III criteria, severity of GI, extraintestinal and psychological symptoms, stress levels, and quality of life were measured with validated questionnaires. Serum cytokines and high-sensitive C-reactive peptide were determined. RESULTS: The criteria for deep remission was fulfilled by 132 patients (44%) and 24 of these fulfilled the Rome III criteria for IBS (18%). Patients with UC in deep remission with IBS-like symptoms had comparable levels of GI symptoms, non-GI somatic symptoms, and quality of life as patients with active UC. The patients with UC in deep remission with IBS-like symptoms had similar levels of fecal calprotectin as patients in deep remission without IBS-like symptoms (18 versus 31 mug/g, P = 0.11), but higher levels of serum cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, IL-13, IL-10 and IL-8, P < 0.05) and higher levels of anxiety (P < 0.001), depression (P = 0.02) and perceived stress (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: IBS-like symptoms in patients with UC in deep remission are common, but not as prevalent as previously reported. Poor psychological well-being and increased serum cytokine levels, but not colonic low-grade inflammation, were associated with IBS-like symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Symptoms compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are common in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in clinical remission. It has been suggested that these symptoms might arise due to post-inflammatory changes comparable with post-infectious IBS. The aim was to study factors at new onset of UC that predict development of IBS-like symptoms during clinical remission. METHODS: In total, 98 patients with new onset of UC were followed prospectively for 3 years with yearly follow-up visits. Data from the first visit at the onset of UC were compared between a group of patients who fulfilled the criteria for IBS while in remission (UCR+IBS) during follow-up and a group who did not (UCR-IBS). RESULTS: Among the UC patients, 87 met the criteria for clinical remission and 25 (29%) of these reported IBS-like symptoms in remission during follow-up. There was no difference in inflammatory disease activity at the initial flare or in the prevalence of previous IBS symptoms when comparing UCR+IBS and UCR-IBS patients. The UCR+IBS patients reported more severe gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, during their primary flare. CONCLUSION: The severity and extent of inflammation at onset of UC do not seem to affect the development of IBS-like symptoms in UC patients during clinical remission. The high prevalence of IBS-like symptoms is not explained by pre-existing IBS. UCR+IBS patients reported more severe gastrointestinal symptoms at disease onset, which might indicate a more sensitive gastrointestinal tract in this category of patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Emerging data suggest that vitamin D has a significant role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Prospective data evaluating the association of vitamin D serum status and disease course are lacking. We sought to determine the relationship between vitamin D status and clinical course of IBD over a multiyear time period. METHODS: IBD patients with up to 5-year follow-up from a longitudinal IBD natural history registry were included. Patients were categorized according to their mean serum 25-OH vitamin D level. IBD clinical status was approximated with patterns of medication use, health-care utilization, biochemical markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)), pain and clinical disease activity scores, and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 965 IBD patients (61.9% Crohn's disease, 38.1% ulcerative colitis) formed the study population (mean age 44 years, 52.3% female). Among them, 29.9% had low mean vitamin D levels. Over the 5-year study period, subjects with low mean vitamin D required significantly more steroids, biologics, narcotics, computed tomography scans, emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and surgery compared with subjects with normal mean vitamin D levels (P<0.05). Moreover, subjects with low vitamin D levels had worse pain, disease activity scores, and quality of life (P<0.05). Finally, subjects who received vitamin D supplements had a significant reduction in their health-care utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Low vitamin D levels are common in IBD patients and are associated with higher morbidity and disease severity, signifying the potential importance of vitamin D monitoring and treatment.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The most prevalent inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Immune processes play a vital role in the etiopathogenesis of these conditions, involving both cellular and humoral response mechanisms. The aim of this study was to quantify CD40- and CD80-positive cells in the biopsy specimens of large intestinal mucosa from children with IBD. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The study comprised 38 children aged between 3-17 years (mean 11.5+/-3.7 years) - 20 boys (52.6 %) and 18 girls (47.4%). Eighteen patients were diagnosed with UC on the basis of clinical manifestation, endoscopic and histopathological findings. Mean age of this subgroup was 11.55+/-4.07 years. A group of 10 children (mean age 12.30+/-2.83) diagnosed with CD was also included. The control group comprised 10 IBD-free children (mean age 10.28+/-4.07 years). The surface expressions of CD40 and CD80 were analyzed in large intestine mucosa biopsy specimens, fixed in formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cut with a microtome into 4 microm slices. RESULTS: The number of CD40- and CD80-positive cells in the large intestinal mucosa of children with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis was significantly higher than in the controls. The highest number of CD40+ and CD80+ cells was observed in the caecal mucosal membrane of Crohn's disease patients and in the rectal mucosa of individuals with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSION: IBD is characterized by elevated, segment-specific, expression of CD40 and CD80.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] presenting in early childhood is extremely rare. More recently, progress has been made to identify children with monogenic forms of IBD predominantly presenting very early in life. In this study, we describe the heterogeneous phenotypes and genotypes of patients with IBD presenting before the age of 2 years and establish phenotypic features associated with underlying monogenicity. METHODS: Phenotype data of 62 children with disease onset before the age of 2 years presenting over the past 20 years were reviewed. Children without previously established genetic diagnosis were prospectively recruited for next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: In all, 62 patients [55% male] were identified. The median disease onset was 3 months of age (interquartile range [IQR]: 1 to 11). Conventional IBD classification only applied to 15 patients with Crohn's disease [CD]-like [24%] and three with ulcerative colitis [UC]-like [5%] phenotype; 44 patients [71%] were diagnosed with otherwise unclassifiable IBD. Patients frequently required parenteral nutrition [40%], extensive immunosuppression [31%], haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation [29%], and abdominal surgery [19%]. In 31% of patients, underlying monogenic diseases were established [EPCAM, IL10, IL10RA, IL10RB, FOXP3, LRBA, SKIV2L, TTC37, TTC7A]. Phenotypic features significantly more prevalent in monogenic IBD were: consanguinity, disease onset before the 6th month of life, stunting, extensive intestinal disease and histological evidence of epithelial abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: IBD in children with disease onset before the age of 2 years is frequently unclassifiable into Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, particularly treatment resistant, and can be indistinguishable from monogenic diseases with IBD-like phenotype.},

   abstract = {Goji berry (Lycium barbarum) exerts immune modulation and suppresses inflammation in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesized that Goji berry had beneficial effects on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice through suppressing inflammation. Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were supplemented with a standard AIN-93G diet with or without 1% (w/w) Goji berry for 4 weeks. Then, colitis was induced by supplementing 3% DSS in drinking water for 7 days, followed by 7 days of remission period to mimic ulcerative colitis symptoms. Goji berry supplementation ameliorated DSS-induced body weight loss, diminished diarrhea and gross bleeding, and resulted in a significantly decreased disease activity index, as well as DSS-associated colon shortening. Moreover, 30% mortality rate caused by DSS-induced colitis was avoided because of Goji berry supplementation. Histologically, Goji berry ameliorated colonic edema, mucosal damage and neutrophil infiltration into colonic intestinal tissue in response to DSS challenge, which was associated with decreased expression of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, as well as inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 and cyclooxygenase-2. In conclusion, Goji supplementation confers protective effects against DSS-induced colitis, which is associated with decreased neutrophil infiltration and suppressed inflammation. Thus, dietary Goji is likely beneficial to inflammatory bowel disease patients as a complementary therapeutic strategy.},

   abstract = {Intestinal mucosal barrier, mainly composed of the intestinal mucus layer and the epithelium, plays a critical role in nutrient absorption as well as protection from pathogenic microorganisms. It is widely acknowledged that the damage of intestinal mucosal barrier or the disturbance of microorganism balance in the intestinal tract contributes greatly to the pathogenesis and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which mainly includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process that involves degradation of protein aggregates and damaged organelles for recycling. The roles of autophagy in the pathogenesis and progression of IBD have been increasingly studied. This present review mainly describes the roles of autophagy of Paneth cells, macrophages, and goblet cells in IBD, and finally, several potential therapeutic strategies for IBD taking advantage of autophagy.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Anti-TNF agents are the mainstay of therapy in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) not responding to 5-aminosalisylic acid, corticosteroids, immunmodulators and for patients dependent on corticosteroids. There is a therapeutic gap of 30%- 60% with infliximab and adalimumab, which is required to be bridged by newer agents. The present review summarizes the literature on the role of golimumab, a new anti TNF agent, in ulcerative colitis. AREAS COVERED: Literature search was done on PubMed using the search terms 'golimumab' AND 'ulcerative colitis' from inception till March 2016. Golimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha, was approved by FDA for clinical use in UC in 2013. In vitro studies showed golimumab to be better than infliximab and adalimumab in terms of affinity and neutralization of TNF-alpha and its conformational stability. Golimumab was found to be effective and safe in inducing and maintaining clinical remission, clinical response and mucosal healing in patients with UC in the two registration trials. Expert commentary: Although there is no difference in terms of efficacy between golimumab, infliximab and adalimumab, golimumab is better than infliximab in terms of route of administration (subcutaneous vs intravenous) and better than adalimumab in terms of frequency of dosing (4 weeks vs 2 weeks).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with intestinal-specific inflammation. Nonetheless, a specific role of obesity in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is unclear. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of U.S. women enrolled in 1989 in the Nurses' Health Study II. At baseline, we collected information on height, weight, waist and hip circumference, weight at age 18, and body shape at age 20. We used Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 111,498 women (median age, 35 yr), we documented 153 cases of Crohn's disease (CD) and 229 cases of ulcerative colitis (UC) more than 18 years of follow-up, encompassing 2,028,769 person-years. Compared with women with normal BMI, the multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios of CD were 2.33 (95% CI, 1.15-4.69) for obese women at age 18 and 1.58 (95% CI, 1.01-2.47) for obese women at baseline. Increasing weight gain between age 18 and baseline was associated with increased risk of CD (Ptrend = 0.04). Adolescent body habitus was also associated with risk of CD with a multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio of CD of 1.63 (95% CI, 1.07-2.50) for women with overweight/obese body shape compared with women with a thin/slender body shape. We did not observe a significant association between any of these anthropometric measures and risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: In a large prospective cohort of U.S. women, measures of adiposity were associated with an increased risk of CD but not UC. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the biological mechanisms by which excess adiposity may increase the risk of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Androgens, which are known to be altered by exogenous hormone use, have recently been linked to alterations of the gut microbiome and mucosal immune function. No study has evaluated the association between circulating levels of androgens and risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study and Nurses' Health Study II who provided a blood specimen. Cases of CD and UC were each matched to 2 controls. Prediagnosis plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin were measured. We examined the association of each analyte with risk of CD or UC using conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: Compared with women in the lowest quintile of testosterone, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratios for CD were 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.39-1.90) for women in the second quintile, 0.49 (95% confidence interval, 0.21-1.15) for the third quartile, 0.22 (0.08-0.65) for the fourth quintile, and 0.39 (95% confidence interval, 0.16-0.99) for the highest quintile (Plinear trend = 0.004). In contrast, we did not observe a consistent association between prediagnostic testosterone and risk of UC (Plinear trend = 0.84). We also did not observe any association between plasma levels of sex hormone-binding globulin or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and risk of UC or CD (all Plinear trends > 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Among women, prediagnostic circulating testosterone is associated with a lower risk of CD but not UC. Further studies to understand the biological mechanisms by which endogenous androgens may mediate the etiopathogenesis of CD are warranted.},

   abstract = {Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have separately identified many genetic susceptibility loci for ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and colorectal cancer (CRC), there has been no large-scale examination for pleiotropy, or shared genetic susceptibility, for these conditions. We used logistic regression modeling to examine the associations of 181 UC and CD susceptibility variants previously identified by GWAS with risk of CRC using data from the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium and the Colon Cancer Family Registry. We also examined associations of significant variants with clinical and molecular characteristics in a subset of the studies. Among 11794 CRC cases and 14190 controls, rs11676348, the susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for UC, was significantly associated with reduced risk of CRC (P = 7E-05). The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio of CRC with each copy of the T allele was 0.93 (95% CI 0.89-0.96). The association of the SNP with risk of CRC differed according to mucinous histological features (P heterogeneity = 0.008). In addition, the (T) allele was associated with lower risk of tumors with Crohn's-like reaction but not tumors without such immune infiltrate (P heterogeneity = 0.02) and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-high) but not microsatellite stable or MSI-low tumors (P heterogeneity = 0.03). The minor allele (T) in SNP rs11676348, located downstream from CXCR2 that has been implicated in CRC progression, is associated with a lower risk of CRC, particularly tumors with a mucinous component, Crohn's-like reaction and MSI-high. Our findings offer the promise of risk stratification of inflammatory bowel disease patients for complications such as CRC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent animal studies have identified that dietary salt intake may modify the risk and progression of autoimmune disorders through modulation of the IL-23/TH17 pathway, which is critical in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of U.S. women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and NHSII who provided detailed and validated information on diet and lifestyle beginning in 1984 in NHS and 1991 in NHSII. We confirmed incident cases of UC and CD reported through 2010 in NHS and 2011 in NHSII. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. In a case-control study nested within these cohorts, we evaluated the interaction between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in TH17 pathway and dietary potassium on risk of CD and UC. In a cohort of healthy volunteers, we also assessed the effect of supplemental potassium on development of naive and memory T cells, differentiated with TGFbeta1 or TH17 conditions. RESULTS: Among a total of 194,711 women over a follow-up of 3,220,247 person-years, we documented 273 cases of CD and 335 cases of UC. Dietary intake of potassium (Ptrend = 0.005) but not sodium (Ptrend = 0.44) was inversely associated with risk of CD. Although, both dietary potassium and sodium were not significantly associated with risk of UC, there was a suggestion of an inverse association with dietary potassium (Ptrend = 0.08). The association of potassium with risk of CD and UC appeared to be modified by loci involved in the TH17 pathway that have previously been associated with susceptibility to CD, particularly SNP rs7657746 (IL21) (Pinteraction = 0.004 and 0.01, respectively). In vitro, potassium enhanced the expression of Foxp3 in both naive and memory CD4+ T cells via activating Smad2/3 and inhibiting Smad7 in TH17 cells. CONCLUSION: Dietary potassium is inversely associated with risk of CD with both in vitro and gene-environment interaction data suggesting a potential role for potassium in regulating immune tolerance through its effect on Tregs and TH17 pathway.},

   abstract = {Among the neoplasias, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in men and women. The increasing incidence of this type of cancer is due to the increase in the population's life expectancy, by the increase in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and the change in eating habits. The American Cancer Society (2011) shows that diet might be responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in developed countries, moreover when considering only colorectal cancer, the number can reach 30% to 50%. Probiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of many bowel diseases as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, gluten intolerance, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pyloriinfection, and colon cancer. Classical examples are strains from the Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacteriumgenus that have probiotic proprieties with a potential use in the prophylaxis, as well as in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal tract disorders. Researchers are focusing on extremely important studies regarding the possibility of using probiotics to promote a balanced microbiota composition, and a sufficient immunological surveillance system as a way to prevent cancer. Considering the fact that the human intestines host 100 trillion bacteria, including more than 1,000 species, there is still need to perform more in depth investigations in order to find probiotics with potential to prevent, and treat cancerous diseases, adding a very promising effect to this already successful panorama. This revision aims to conduct a review of the most recent studies correlating probiotics and its cancer preventing and treatment potential.},

   abstract = {This study sought to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of mango (Mangifera Indica L.) polyphenolics containing gallic acid and gallotanins, and the role of the miR-126/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis in vitro and in vivo. Polyphenolics extracted from mango (var. Keitt) were investigated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated CCD-18Co cells. Rats received either a beverage with mango polyphenolics or a control beverage, and were exposed to three cycles of 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) followed by a 2-wk recovery period. The mango extract (10 mg GAE/L) suppressed the protein expression of NF-kappaB, p-NF-kappaB, PI3K (p85beta), HIF-1alpha, p70S6K1, and RPS6 in LPS-treated CCD-18Co cells. LPS reduced miR-126 expression, whereas, the mango extract induced miR-126 expression in a dose-dependent manner. The relationship between miR-126 and its target, PI3K (p85beta), was confirmed by treating cells with miR-126 antagomiR where mango polyphenols reversed the effects of the antagomiR. In vivo, mango beverage protected against DSS-induced colonic inflammation (47%, P = 0.05) and decreased the Ki-67 labeling index in the central and basal regions compared to the control. Mango beverage significantly attenuated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and iNOS at the mRNA and protein level. Moreover, the expression of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR was reduced, whereas, miR-126 was upregulated by the mango treatment. These results suggest that mango polyphenols attenuated inflammatory response by modulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at least in part through upregulation of miRNA-126 expression both in vitro and in vivo; thus, mango polyphenolics might be relevant as preventive agents in ulcerative colitis.

   abstract = {SCOPE: Tannin-rich fruits have been evaluated as alternative prevention strategies for colorectal cancer based on their anti-inflammatory properties. This study compared tannin-rich preparations from mango (rich in gallotannins) and pomegranate (rich in ellagitannins) in the dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis model. METHODS AND RESULTS: In rats, mango and pomegranate beverages decreased intestinal inflammation and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mucosa and serum. The mango beverage suppressed the ratio of phosphorylated/total protein expression of the IGF-1R-AKT/mTOR axis and downregulated mRNA expression of Igf1, Insr, and pik3cv. Pomegranate decreased p70S6K and RPS6, as well as Rps6ka2, Map2k2, and Mapk1 mRNA. In silico modeling indicated a high binding of docked of gallic acid to the catalytic domain of IGF-1R, which may suppress the activity of the enzyme. Ellagic acid docked effectively into the catalytic domains of both IGF-1R and EGFR. In vitro assays with lipopolysaccharide-treated CCD-18Co cells using polyphenolic extracts from each beverage, as well as pure compounds, corroborated the predictions made in silico. CONCLUSION: Mango polyphenols inhibited the IGF-1R- AKT/mTOR axis, and pomegranate polyphenols downregulate the mTOR downstream pathway through reductions in ERK1/2. These results suggest that extracts rich in gallo- and ellagitannins act on different molecular targets in the protection against ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, involves chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Previously, Sasa quelpaertensis leaves have been shown to mediate anti-inflammation and anti-cancer effects, although it remains unclear whether Sasa leaves are able to attenuate inflammation-related intestinal diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of Sasa quelpaertensis leaf extract (SQE) using an in vitro co-culture model of the intestinal epithelial environment. MATERIALS/METHODS: An in vitro co-culture system was established that consisted of intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce inflammation. RESULTS: Treatment with SQE significantly suppressed the secretion of LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-6, and IL-1beta in co-cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages. In addition, expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were down-regulated in response to inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation by SQE. Compared with two bioactive compounds that have previously been identified in SQE, tricin and P-coumaric acid, SQE exhibited the most effective anti-inflammatory properties. CONCLUSIONS: SQE exhibited intestinal anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting various inflammatory mediators mediated through nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-kB) activation. Thus, SQE has the potential to ameliorate inflammation-related diseases, including IBD, by limiting excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes have been widely studied in adult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but data on MHC genes are scarce in pediatric IBD. This study focused on MHC association of genes with pediatric-onset IBD and its different phenotypes. METHODS: Blood samples of 103 patients with pediatric IBD (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis) were collected at Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, Finland. HLA-A, -B, -DRB1 alleles and complement C4A and C4B gene copy numbers were determined and constructed into haplotypes by a Bayesian algorithm (PHASE). A general population cohort (n = 149) served as a control. HLA-alleles and C4 deficiency frequencies were compared between patients and controls with chi-squared and Fisher exact test with Bonferroni correction (Pcorr). RESULTS: One MHC haplotype HLA-A03; HLA-B07; 1 C4A gene; 1 C4B gene; HLA-DRB115 was more common in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis than in controls (7/61, 11.5%, 6/42, 14.3% and 1/149, 0.7%, respectively, odds ratio (OR) = 19.19, 95% CI 2.31-159.57, Pcorr = 0.004 for Crohn disease vs controls and OR = 24.67, 95% CI 2.88-211.36, Pcorr = 0.002 for ulcerative colitis vs controls). Two MHC markers were associated with clinical characteristics. HLA-DRB101 was more common in patients with milder disease course, that is, no need for anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha medication (18/32, 56.2% vs 19/71, 26.8% without and with anti-TNF-alpha medication, respectively, OR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.12-0.68, Pcorr = 0.032). C4B deficiency (<2 C4B genes) was associated with complicated recovery after surgery (12/16, 75.0% vs 4/16, 25.0%, respectively, OR = 9.00, 95% CI 1.82-44.59, Pcorr = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: One MHC haplotype is strongly linked with pediatric-onset IBD, whereas the need for immunomodulatory therapy and surgery outcome associates with other distinct MHC gene markers.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 25% of patients with ulcerative colitis [UC] experience a severe flare requiring steroid therapy to avoid colectomy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of tacrolimus as a rescue therapy for active UC. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for relevant studies assessing the efficacy of tacrolimus for active UC. Outcomes included short- and long-term clinical response, colectomy free rates, and rate of adverse events in randomised controlled trials [RCTs] and observational studies. RESULTS: Two RCTs comparing high trough concentration [10-15ng/ml] versus placebo [n = 103] and 23 observational studies [n = 831] were identified. Clinical response at 2 weeks was significantly higher with tacrolimus compared with placebo (risk ratio [RR] = 4.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.09-10.17, p = 0.15 x 10(-3)] among RCTs. Rates of clinical response at 1 and 3 months were 0.73 [95% CI = 0.64-0.81] and 0.76 [95% CI = 0.59-0.87], and colectomy-free rates remained high at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months [0.86, 0.84, 0.78, and 0.69, respectively] among observational studies. Among RCTs, adverse events were more frequent compared with placebo [RR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.20-3.37, p = 0.83 x 10(-2)], but there was no difference in severe adverse events [RR = 3.15, 95% CI = 0.14-72.9, p = 0.47]. Severe adverse events were rare among observational studies [0.11, 95% CI = 0.06-0.20]. CONCLUSIONS: In the present meta-analysis, tacrolimus was associated with high clinical response and colectomy-free rates without increased risk of severe adverse events for active UC.},

   abstract = {OPINION STATEMENT: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is an inflammatory cytokine that plays a major role during the initiation and perpetuation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Anti-TNF-alpha agents are the most widely used biologics that specifically target either or both circulating and membrane-bound TNF-alpha, thus preventing its pro-inflammatory activity. Despite their efficacy, one third of the patients receiving anti-TNF-alpha agents are primary non-responders and nearly half of the patients that initially respond may subsequently lose response (secondary loss of response). Many of these cases can be explained by immunogenicity, which can lead to lower drug levels associated with reduced response and serious adverse effects that cause patients to withdraw from treatment. New treatment algorithms instruct practitioners to check drug and antibody levels when there is loss of response, and then provide guidance towards either dose optimization and/or change in the biologic agent or class to help regain efficacy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Anemia is a common manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can greatly affect patients' quality of life. We performed a prospective study of a large cohort of patients with IBD to determine if patterns of anemia over time are associated with aggressive or disabling disease. METHODS: We performed a longitudinal analysis of demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data from a registry of patients with IBD at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center from 2009 through 2013. Patients with a complete follow-up evaluation (at least 1 annual visit with laboratory results) were included. Anemia was defined by World Health Organization criteria. Disease activity scores (the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or the ulcerative colitis activity index) and quality-of-life scores (based on the short IBD questionnaire) were determined at each visit; laboratory data, including levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rates, as well as patterns of IBD-related health care use, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 410 IBD patients (245 with Crohn's disease, 165 with ulcerative colitis; 50.5% female) were included. The prevalence of anemia in patients with IBD was 37.1% in 2009 and 33.2% in 2013. Patients with IBD and anemia required significantly more health care and had higher indices of disease activity, as well as a lower average quality of life, than patients without anemia (P < .0001). Anemia (persistent or recurrent) for 3 or more years was correlated independently with hospitalizations (P < .01), visits to gastroenterology clinics (P < .001), telephone calls (P < .004), surgeries for IBD (P = .01), higher levels of C-reactive protein (in patients with ulcerative colitis, P = .001), and a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P < .0001). Anemia was correlated negatively with quality-of-life scores (P < .03). CONCLUSIONS: Based on a longitudinal analysis of 410 patients, persistent or recurrent anemia correlates with more aggressive or disabling disease in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents are an important component of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment, but data on their influence on anemia, a frequent complication of IBD, are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of anti-TNF agents on hemoglobin (Hb) levels in a large IBD cohort. METHODS: Prospectively collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data from IBD patients who started anti-TNF treatment at a tertiary referral center during the years 2010 to 2012 were analyzed. Follow-up data including disease activity scores (Harvey-Bradshaw index or ulcerative colitis activity index), quality of life scores (short IBD questionnaire) completed at each visit, and laboratory data were analyzed. Data from the year of anti-TNF initiation (yr 0) to the following year (yr 1) were compared. RESULTS: A total of 430 IBD patients (324 with Crohn's disease, 51.6% females) started anti-TNF treatment. The prevalence of anemia and median Hb levels did not change between years 0 and 1. Median short IBD questionnaire was significantly improved at year 1 (P = 0.002). IBD patients with anemia had significantly higher median Hb levels at year 1 compared with year 0 (P = 0.0009). Hematopoietic response (increase of Hb >/=2 g/dL) was observed in only 33.6% of the 134 anemic IBD patients, despite iron replacement being administered in 126 anemic patients (oral, 77%). Improvement in Hb levels was independently significantly correlated with change of C-reactive protein levels (P = 0.04) and immunomodulator use (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Anemia remains a significant manifestation of IBD 1 year after treatment with anti-TNF agents.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but its prevalence in the United States is not well defined. Aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of anemia in IBD patients who were followed in a US referral center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data from a prospective, consented longitudinal IBD registry between the years 2009 and 2013 were analyzed. Disease activity was evaluated using Harvey-Bradshaw index in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) activity index in UC as well as C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Anemia was defined based on the World Health Organization criteria. RESULTS: A total of 1821 IBD patients (1077 with CD, 744 with UC, median age 43.8 y, 51.9% female) were included. The 5-year period prevalence of anemia in IBD patients was 50.1%, (CD: 53.3% vs. UC: 44.7%, P=0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, anemia was associated with surgery for IBD [odds ratio (OR)=2.77; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.21-3.48; P<0.0001], female gender (OR=1.29; 95% CI, 1.04-1.61; P=0.02), C-reactive protein (OR=1.26; 95% CI, 1.16-1.37; P<0.0001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OR=1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03; P=0.0002), and use of biologics (OR=2.00; 95% CI, 1.58-2.52; P=0.0001) or immunomodulators (OR=1.51; 95% CI, 1.21-1.87; P=0.0003). Iron replacement therapy was administered to 46.8% of the anemic patients. CONCLUSION: Anemia has a high period prevalence in IBD patients followed at a tertiary center. Anemia is more common in CD than in UC, is associated with disease activity, and in current practice is undertreated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are at increased risk of colorectal neoplasia (CRN) presumably because of chronic inflammation. Data on the relationship between long-term serum inflammatory biomarkers and the development of CRN in UC are limited. METHODS: We performed a 5-year study (2009-2013) of demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data of patients with UC from an inflammatory bowel disease registry in relation to the development of CRN. Disease activity was evaluated by UC activity index and by serum biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hemoglobin, platelets, and albumin levels. A score based on the combination of median CRP and median albumin levels (0: both normal, 1: one of them abnormal, 2: both abnormal) was also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 773 patients with UC (median age 46 yr, 46.4% women) were included. Fifty-five patients (7.1%) developed CRN. Patients with UC and CRN had significantly higher median CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and platelets and lower hemoglobin and albumin levels compared with those without CRN. The prevalence of a CRP-albumin score (1 or 2) was significantly higher in the CRN group (40.0% or 30.9% versus 14.2% or 6.0%, respectively, P < 0.0001). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, CRN was associated with male gender (P = 0.01), disease duration (P = 0.04), extensive colitis (P = 0.03), concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis (P = 0.0003), median albumin levels (P = 0.03), and an increased CRP-albumin score (score 1 or 2) (P = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term serum inflammatory markers including the CRP-albumin score are associated with increased risk of CRN in patients with UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been linked to an increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Dyslipidemia is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term lipid profiles in a large cohort of IBD patients. METHODS: Data of patients from an IBD registry who had more than one measurement of total cholesterol and triglyceride levels during the follow-up period were analyzed. The lipid profiles of IBD patients were compared to those of the general population according to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2009-2012). Quartiles of cholesterol or triglyceride levels in relation to surrogate markers of disease severity were analyzed. RESULTS: Seven hundred and one IBD patients [54% Crohn's disease (CD), 46% ulcerative colitis (UC)] were included. IBD patients had less frequent high total cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol (6 vs. 13 and 5 vs. 10%) and more frequent low HDL and high triglycerides (24 vs. 17 and 33 vs. 25%) compared to the general population (all p < 0.001). Median total cholesterol levels were lower and median triglycerides higher in CD compared to UC (171 vs. 184; 123 vs. 100 mg/dL; both p < 0.001). In the multiple regression analysis, lipid profile was independently associated with hospitalizations (low cholesterol) and IBD surgeries (low cholesterol and high triglycerides). CONCLUSIONS: Low total cholesterol and high triglyceride levels are more frequent in IBD patients (in particular CD) compared to healthy controls and are independently associated with more severe disease.},

   abstract = {Osteoporosis is more frequent in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. A reduction in bone mineral mass in these individuals is caused not only by inflammatory processes in the bowel, because osteoporosis occurs already in very young IBD patients and in newly diagnosed individuals who have not yet undergone any pharmacological treatment. One of individual determinants of the bone turnover parameters is osteoprotegerin (OPG) encoded by the TNFRSF11B gene. The c.-223C > T polymorphism in this gene has been extensively studied in post-menopausal osteoporosis patients. However, no such studies exist for osteoporosis related to IBD. The aim of our study was to determine whether the c.-223C > T (rs2073617) polymorphism in the 5'UTR region of the gene encoding osteoprotegerin is a functional polymorphism which may change the gene expression and resulting OPG levels, and so be associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis, and impaired bone metabolism in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. Our study included 198 IBD patients and 41 healthy controls. Lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density, T-score, Z-score as well as OPG, RANKL, vitamin D, calcium and interleukin 4 and 10 concentrations were determined for all study subjects. Genotyping of the TNFRSF11B polymorphic site was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Statistical analyses were conducted using Statistica software. Odds ratios, 95 % confidence intervals, and P values were calculated using the HWE calculator. Our results did not allow determining an unequivocal association between the polymorphic variants of the TNFRSF11B 5'UTR region and a susceptibility to osteoporosis in IBD patients. We have shown, however, that the c.-223T allele was twice as more frequent in Crohn's disease (CD) patients than among controls (OR = 1.99, P value = 0.009). Interestingly, average osteoprotegerin levels in CD patients did not significantly differ from those in controls, whereas in ulcerative colitis patients, OPG levels were significantly lower. We have concluded that low OPG levels may be associated with osteoporosis in ulcerative colitis, but it is not correlated with the c.-223C > T polymorphism in the TNFRSF11B gene. In CD patients, in turn, we observed increased RANKL levels. Our observations confirm different pathogeneses of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as well as different molecular backgrounds of osteoporosis associated with these two diseases.},

   abstract = {Secondary osteoporosis occurs as an isolated pathology or co-exists with types I and II osteoporosis. The gastroenterologist may come across osteoporosis or osteopenia in a patient with a gastrointestinal disease. This is often a young patient in whom investigations should be carried out and appropriate treatment initiated, aimed at preventing bone fractures and the formation of the best peak bone mass. Osteoporosis occurs in patients with the following conditions: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, post gastrectomy patients, patients with short bowel syndrome, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, treated with steroids (steroid-induced osteoporosis) and patients using proton pump inhibitors chronically (state of achlorhydria). It is therefore necessary to approve a list of risk factors of secondary osteoporosis, the presence of which would be an indication for screening for osteoporosis, including a DXA study and the development of a separate algorithm for the therapeutic management of secondary osteoporosis accompanying gastrointestinal diseases, especially in premenopausal young women and young men, because there are currently no registered drugs with proven antifracture activity for this group of patients.},

One of the questions often raised is vitamin D deficiency. Calcitriol acts on cells, tissues and organs through a vitamin D receptor. The result of this action is the multi-directional effect of vitamin D. The reasons for vitamin D deficiency are: decreased exposure to sunlight, inadequate diet, inflammatory lesions of the intestinal mucosa and post-gastrointestinal resection states. This leads not only to osteomalacia but also to osteoporosis. Of significance may be the effect of vitamin D on the course of the disease itself, through modulation of the inflammatory mechanisms. It is also necessary to pay attention to the role of vitamin D in skeletal pathology in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and thus take measures aimed at preventing and treating these disorders through the supplementation of vitamin D.},

Still there is a search for a perfect marker for this group of patients which would help in the diagnosis of the disease, in determinating its activity and in monitoring the treatment. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the usefulness of the application of calprotectin measurement in stool samples from children with IBD, as a marker of the severity of inflammation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed 156 patients: 58 with ulcerative colitis (UC), 67 with Crohn's disease (CD), and 31 from the control group. In all patients the concentration of calprotectin in the sample of feces, markers of inflammation and hemoglobin were measured. RESULTS: Concentration of calprotectin in feces of patients with IBD was above the normal range in all patients with moderate and severe disease and in the majority with mild disease or in remission, but it was normal in all patients from the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated concentration of fecal calprotectin (FC) was observed in the majority of patients with IBD, but in none from the control group. The number of patients with elevated FC concentration increased together with the disease activity. FC concentration was higher in patients with severe and moderate disease activity. FC concentration in patients with IBD was associated with the increase of inflammatory markers and decreased haemoglobin. Percentage of laboratory abnormalities in children with Crohn's disease and perianal changes was higher. FC concentration can be a noninvasive marker of disease activity in IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The combination of clinical remission and mucosal healing represents a major goal of different treatment strategies for ulcerative colitis (UC). This study aimed to assess which of the endoscopic indices used to evaluate mucosal changes in UC are correlated with clinical indices currently used to determine disease activity, as well as which of the endoscopic indices are correlated with the Geboes Index used for histological evaluation. It also aimed to find correlations between the currently used clinical activity indices and the histological Geboes Index. METHODS: A group of 49 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of UC and a group of 52 individuals without a diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease, who constituted the control group, were investigated. All patients were evaluated by colonoscopy, and the severity of mucosal changes was scored in terms of nine different endoscopic indices commonly used in both pharmacological trials and clinical practice. Evaluation was also carried out using clinical and histological indices. Endoscopic indices used for UC were then correlated with different clinical and histological indices to find the strongest correlations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A high correlation was demonstrated between three of the 11 evaluated clinical indices - Improvement Based on Individual Symptom Scores, Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index, and Schroeder Index - and all nine endoscopic indices - Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity, Baron Score, Schroeder Index, Feagan Index, Powell-Tuck Index, Rachmilewitz Index, Sutherland Index, Lofberg Index, and Lemman Index. Improvement Based on Individual Symptom Scores was the index with the highest correlation with all the endoscopic indices used for UC. The above indices are recommended for clinical evaluation of UC activity. The Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity was moderately correlated with a histological index, and it is therefore recommended for routine endoscopic mucosal evaluation in patients with UC.},

The response of these immune systems to luminal gut microbiota and their products results in altered intestinal permeability, loss of barrier function, and mucosal inflammation and ulceration. Animal models of experiment intestinal inflammation have been developed that leverage the development of spontaneous inflammation in certain mouse strains, e.g. Samp1/Yit mice, or induction of inflammation using gene-targeting e.g. IL-10 null mice, administration of exogenous agents e.g. DSS, or adoptive transfer of T-cells into immunodeficient mice, e.g. CD4(+) CD45Rb(Hi) T-cell transfer. Colitis induced by rectal instillation of the haptenizing agent, 2,4,6 trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, is one of the most commonly used and well-characterized models of Crohn's disease in humans.},

A three-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital with severe active UC, and treated with aminosalicylates and various immunosuppressive drugs. As remission was not achieved, we decided to try FMT before colectomy. We administered donor fecal material a total of six times by retention enema (x2) and via a nasoduodenal tube (x4) within 10 days. The patient developed abdominal pain and pyrexia after each FMT session. Analyses revealed the transferred donor fecal microbiota had not been retained by the patient, who ultimately underwent colectomy. The severity of the UC and/or timing of FMT may have partly accounted for the poor outcome.},

Although our knowledge and understanding of the pathogenesis and causes of IBD have improved significantly, the incidence in the pediatric population is still rising. In the last decade more drugs and treatment option have become available including 5-aminosalicylate, antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunomodulators and biological agents. Before the use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha became available to patients with IBD, the risk for surgery within five years of diagnosis was very high, however, with anti-TNF-alpha treatment the risk of surgery has decreased significantly. In the pediatric population a remission in disease can be achieved by exclusive enteral nutrition. Exclusive enteral nutrition also has an important role in the improvement of nutritional status and maintained growth. In this review we summarize the current therapeutic treatments in CD. The progress in the treatment options and the development of new drugs has led to optimized tactics for achieving the primary clinical goals of therapy - induction and maintenance of remission while improving the patient's growth and overall well-being.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon with unclear pathogenesis. A dysbiotic intestinal microbiota is regarded as a key component in the disease process and there has been significant interest in developing new treatments which target the microbiota. AIM: To give an overview of the studies to date investigating prebiotics and synbiotics for the treatment of UC. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed and related search engines was carried out using the terms "ulcerative colitis" in combination with "prebiotic", "synbiotic" or "dietary fibre". RESULTS: In total 17 studies on humans examining the effect of prebiotics in UC were found. Five major groups could be distinguished. Fructo-oligosaccharides were tried in six studies (mean 35 patients included, range 9-121). One study found a clinical response while two demonstrated indirect evidence of an effect. Germinated barley foodstuff was used in 8 studies (mean 38 patients, range 10-63). One study found an endoscopic response, while four noted a clinical response and two some indirect effects. Galacto-oligosaccharides, lactulose and resveratrol were used in one study each (mean 48 patients, range 41-52). One study found an endoscopic response and one a clinical response. CONCLUSION: There is yet inadequate evidence - especially in humans - to support any particular prebiotic in the clinical management of UC. However, due to the bulk of evidence supporting the effect of the microbiota on colonic inflammation, there is enough potential to justify further high-quality clinical trials investigating this subject.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are an important cause of morbidity and impact significantly on quality of life. Overall, current treatments do not sustain a long-term clinical remission and are associated with adverse effects, which highlight the need for new treatment options. Fucoidans are complex sulphated, fucose-rich polysaccharides, found in edible brown algae and are described as having multiple bioactivities including potent anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of two different fucoidan preparations, fucoidan-polyphenol complex (Maritech Synergy) and depyrogenated fucoidan (DPF) was evaluated in the dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) mouse model of acute colitis. Mice were treated once daily over 7 days with fucoidans via oral (Synergy or DPF) or intraperitoneal administration (DPF). Signs and severity of colitis were monitored daily before colons and spleens were collected for macroscopic evaluation, cytokine measurements and histology. Orally administered Synergy and DPF, but not intraperitoneal DPF treatment, significantly ameliorated symptoms of colitis based on retention of body weight, as well as reduced diarrhoea and faecal blood loss, compared to the untreated colitis group. Colon and spleen weight in mice treated with oral fucoidan was also significantly lower, indicating reduced inflammation and oedema. Histological examination of untreated colitis mice confirmed a massive loss of crypt architecture and goblet cells, infiltration of immune cells and oedema, while all aspects of this pathology were alleviated by oral fucoidan. Importantly, in this model, the macroscopic changes induced by oral fucoidan correlated significantly with substantially decreased production of at least 15 pro-inflammatory cytokines by the colon tissue. Overall, oral fucoidan preparations significantly reduce the inflammatory pathology associated with DSS-induced colitis and could therefore represent a novel nutraceutical option for the management of IBD.},

In this study, we present a comprehensive expression analysis of human and murine BTN and BTNL genes in conditions associated with intestinal inflammation and cancer. Using real-time PCR, expression of human BTN and BTNL genes was analyzed in samples from patients with ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and colon tumors. Expression of murine Btn and Btnl genes was examined in mouse models of spontaneous colitis (Muc2-/-) and intestinal tumorigenesis (ApcMin/+). Our analysis indicates a strong association of several of the human genes with ulcerative colitis and colon cancer; while especially BTN1A1, BTN2A2, BTN3A3, and BTNL8 were significantly altered in inflammation, colonic tumors exhibited significantly decreased levels of BTNL2, BTNL3, BTNL8, and BTNL9 as compared to unaffected tissue. Colonic inflammation in Muc2-/- mice significantly down-regulated the expression of particularly Btnl1, Btnl4, and Btnl6 mRNA, and intestinal polyps derived from ApcMin/+ mice displayed altered levels of Btn1a1, Btn2a2, and Btnl1 transcripts. Thus, our data present an association of BTN and BTNL genes with intestinal inflammation and cancer and represent a valuable resource for further studies of this gene family.},

   abstract = {The role of the food delivery matrix in probiotic performance in the intestine is not well understood. Because probiotics are often provided to consumers in dairy products, we investigated the contributions of milk to the health-benefiting performance of Lactobacillus casei BL23 in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine model of ulcerative colitis. L. casei BL23 protected against the development of colitis when ingested in milk but not in a nutrient-free buffer simulating consumption as a nutritional supplement. Consumption of (acidified) milk alone also provided some protection against weight loss and intestinal inflammation but was not as effective as L. casei and milk in combination. In contrast, L. casei mutants deficient in DltD (lipoteichoic acid d-alanine transfer protein) or RecA (recombinase A) were unable to protect against DSS-induced colitis, even when consumed in the presence of milk. Mice fed either L. casei or milk contained reduced quantities of colonic proinflammatory cytokines, indicating that the L. casei DltD(-) and RecA(-) mutants as well as L. casei BL23 in nutrient-free buffer were effective at modulating immune responses. However, there was not a direct correlation between colitis and quantities of these cytokines at the time of sacrifice. Identification of the cecal microbiota by 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that L. casei in milk enriched for Comamonadaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae; however, the consumption of neither L. casei nor milk resulted in the restoration of the microbiota to resemble that of healthy animals. These findings strongly indicate that probiotic strain efficacy can be influenced by the food/supplement delivery matrix.},

   abstract = {Some of the most common symptoms of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, which include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. It is therefore not surprising that clinicians and patients have wondered whether dietary patterns influence the onset or course of IBD. The question of what to eat is among the most commonly asked by patients, and among the most difficult to answer for clinicians. There are substantial variations in dietary behaviors of patients and recommendations for them, although clinicians do not routinely endorse specific diets for patients with IBD. Dietary clinical trials have been limited by their inability to include a placebo control, contamination of study groups, and inclusion of patients receiving medical therapies. Additional challenges include accuracy of information on dietary intake, complex interactions between foods consumed, and differences in food metabolism among individuals. We review the roles of diet in the etiology and management of IBD based on plausible mechanisms and clinical evidence. Researchers have learned much about the effects of diet on the mucosal immune system, epithelial function, and the intestinal microbiome; these findings could have significant practical implications. Controlled studies of patients receiving enteral nutrition and observations made from patients on exclusion diets have shown that components of whole foods can have deleterious effects for patients with IBD. Additionally, studies in animal models suggested that certain nutrients can reduce intestinal inflammation. In the future, engineered diets that restrict deleterious components but supplement beneficial nutrients could be used to modify the luminal intestinal environment of patients with IBD; these might be used alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents, or as salvage therapy for patients who do not respond or lose responsiveness to medical therapies. Stricter diets might be required to induce remission, and more sustainable exclusion diets could be used to maintain long-term remission.},

   abstract = {AIM: Infantile-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IO-IBD) with the onset of disease before 12 mo of age, is a different disease entity from childhood IBD. We aimed to describe the clinical features, outcome and role of mutation in interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-10 receptors (IL-10R) in Asian children with IO-IBD. METHODS: All cases of IO-IBD, defined as onset of disease before 12 mo of age, seen at University Malaya Medical Center, Malaysia were reviewed. We performed mutational analysis for IL10 and IL10R genes in patients with presenting clinical features of Crohn's disease (CD). RESULTS: Six [13%; CD = 3, ulcerative colitis (UC) = 2, IBD-unclassified (IBD-U) = 1] of the 48 children (CD = 25; UC = 23) with IBD have IO-IBD. At final review [median (range) duration of follow-up: 6.5 (3.0-20) years], three patients were in remission without immunosuppression [one each for post-colostomy (IBD-U), after standard immunosuppression (CD), and after total colectomy (UC)]. Three patients were on immunosuppression: one (UC) was in remission while two (both CD) had persistent disease. As compared with later-onset disease, IO-IBD were more likely to present with bloody diarrhea (100% vs 55%, P = 0.039) but were similar in terms of an associated autoimmune liver disease (0% vs 19%, P = 0.31), requiring biologics therapy (50% vs 36%, P = 0.40), surgery (50% vs 29%, P = 0.27), or achieving remission (50% vs 64%, P = 0.40). No mutations in either IL10 or IL10R in the three patients with CD and the only patient with IBD-U were identified. CONCLUSION: The clinical features of IO-IBD in this Asian cohort of children who were negative for IL-10 or IL-10R mutations were variable. As compared to childhood IBD with onset of disease after 12 mo of age, IO-IBD achieved remission at a similar rate.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore possible environmental factors behind the regional differences in the incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: All of the patients diagnosed with IBD who were aged 0 to 14 years in Finland between 1987 and 2003 were identified from the Social Insurance Institution database. Finland was divided into squares of 250 x 250 m, and spatial variations of incidence rates were evaluated accordingly. The role of the environmental determinants (pediatric population density, agricultural industry, chemical contaminants of tap water and proximity to the sea or paper mills) in the geographic variations of the incidence rates was evaluated. RESULTS: During the study period, the overall incidence of pediatric IBD was 6.5 of 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.1-6.9). The incidence in very sparsely populated areas (</=10 person-years per 250 x 250 m) was 9.2 of 100,000 (95% CI 6.3-13.1) and 5.6 of 100,000 (95% CI 4.8-6.4) in the districts with the highest population density (>800 person-years per 250 x 250 m). A nonsignificant trend toward the same direction was also seen for ulcerative colitis (trend P = 0.09). Chemical contaminant concentrations of tap water, residence near the seaside, or proximity to paper mills were not associated with the incidence of pediatric IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest higher incidence rates of pediatric IBD in the districts with low compared with high density of child population, but the differences cannot be explained by variations in the environmental exposures evaluated here.},

   abstract = {Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two main types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have become increasingly common in Australasian children and adolescents in recent years. Furthermore, CD and UC are seen more often in younger children. These conditions are typically more extensive in children and tend to follow more severe disease courses than in adults. Although many children may present with typical symptoms (such as abdominal pain or bloody diarrhoea), others have atypical features (including oral ulceration, short stature or skin manifestations). In addition, many children with IBD will have altered growth or nutrition, which may compromise normal linear growth and pubertal development. Early identification and full assessment of children presenting with possible IBD are essential to avoid consequences of diagnostic delay and to optimise short- and long-term outcomes. Management of IBD encompasses various options and should be undertaken within a team-based, child and family-focused, multidisciplinary setting.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Thiopurines are effective for maintenance of remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in only about half of patients. Predictors of response may assist in selecting the most appropriate patients for thiopurine therapy. Thiopurines inhibit Rac1, a GTPase that exerts an antiapoptotic effect on T-lymphocytes. A genetic association was recently demonstrated between a Rac1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and poorer response to thiopurines in adult patients with Crohn disease. We aimed to determine whether Rac1 SNPs are associated with response to thiopurines in children with IBD. METHODS: Children with IBD treated with thiopurines were prospectively followed for 1 year and were genotyped for 3 Rac1 SNPs previously found to be relevant to IBD: rs10951982, rs4720672, and rs34932801. The rate of sustained steroid-free remission (SSFR) without treatment escalation by 12 months was compared between wild types (WTs) and heterozygotes. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were studied (63% boys, 80% having Crohn disease, mean age 13 +/- 4.1). Nineteen of the 41 WT (46%) and 9 of the 15 (60%) heterozygotes for rs10951982 were in SSFR (P = 0.55). Similarly, 21 of the 45 (47%) WT and 8 of the 12 (67%) heterozygotes for rs4720672 were in remission (P = 0.33). Finally, 21 of the 45 (47%) WT and 3 of the 5 (60%) heterozygotes for rs34932801 were in remission (P = 0.66). All of the 3 comparisons remained nonsignificant in a sensitivity analysis of only the patients with Crohn disease. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find an association between 3 Rac1 SNPs and thiopurine effectiveness by 12 months in a prospective study of children with IBD. Other predictors of response should be sought to optimize patient selection for thiopurine therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Genome-wide association studies have identified 200 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) loci, but the genetic architecture of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis remain incompletely defined. Here, we aimed to identify novel associations between IBD and functional genetic variants using the Illumina ExomeChip (San Diego, CA). METHODS: Genotyping was performed in 10,523 IBD cases and 5726 non-IBD controls. There were 91,713 functional single-nucleotide polymorphism loci in coding regions analyzed. A novel identified association was replicated further in 2 independent cohorts. We further examined the association of the identified single-nucleotide polymorphism with microbiota from 338 mucosal lavage samples in the Mucosal Luminal Interface cohort measured using 16S sequencing. RESULTS: We identified an association between CD and a missense variant encoding alanine or threonine at position 391 in the zinc transporter solute carrier family 39, member 8 protein (SLC39A8 alanine 391 threonine, rs13107325) and replicated the association with CD in 2 replication cohorts (combined meta-analysis P = 5.55 x 10(-13)). This variant has been associated previously with distinct phenotypes including obesity, lipid levels, blood pressure, and schizophrenia. We subsequently determined that the CD risk allele was associated with altered colonic mucosal microbiome composition in both healthy controls (P = .009) and CD cases (P = .0009). Moreover, microbes depleted in healthy carriers strongly overlap with those reduced in CD patients (P = 9.24 x 10(-16)) and overweight individuals (P = 6.73 x 10(-16)). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an SLC39A8-dependent shift in the gut microbiome could explain its pleiotropic effects on multiple complex diseases including CD.},

   abstract = {Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone that possesses immunomodulatory properties and has been demonstrated to potentially influence inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis and activity. Epidemiologic data have associated vitamin D deficiency with an increased risk of IBD, hospitalizations, surgery, and loss of response to biologic therapy. Conversely, IBD itself can lead to vitamin D deficiency. This bidirectional relationship between vitamin D and IBD suggests the need for monitoring and repletion of vitamin D, as needed, in the IBD patient. This review discusses the role of vitamin D in IBD and provides practical guidance on vitamin D repletion.},

The aim of this study is to investigate the potential protective effect of oat beta-glucan (betaG) against colitis induced by DSS in mice. Eighty mice were randomly divided into the control group (no DSS, no betaG), DSS group (DSS only), DSS + L-betaG group (DSS plus 500 mg per kg betaG), and DSS + H-betaG group (DSS plus 1000 mg per kg betaG). Compared with the DSS group, administration of betaG significantly reduced clinical symptoms with less weight loss, diarrhea and shortening of the colon, the severity of colitis was significantly inhibited as evidenced by the reduced disease activity index (DAI) and degree of histological damage in colon. Moreover, treatment with betaG not only decreased myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), and nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, but also inhibited mRNA and protein expression of pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and iNOS. This suggests that oat betaG in diet might exhibit an anti-inflammatory function against colitis through inhibition of expression of pro-inflammatory factors.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Association of Signal transducers and activators of transcription-4 (STAT4) gene polymorphism with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease have been investigated in a number of epidemiological studies, but the results are inclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to more precisely estimate the relationship. METHODS: The databases of Pubmed and CBM updated to October, 2014 were retrieved. Random- or fixed-effect model was used to estimate odd radio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) on the basis of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Seven articles containing 2196 Crohn's disease (CD) cases, 1588 ulcerative colitis (UC) cases and 4126 controls were identified. We detected a significant association between STAT4 rs7574865 polymorphism and IBD susceptibility in overall population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.855, 95% CI=0.760-0.962, P=0.009), but not in Caucasian and Asian population, respectively. No association was detected between rs7574865 polymorphism and CD susceptibility in overall, Asian and Caucasian population, respectively. Interestingly, a significant association was detected between rs7574865 with UC susceptibility in overall population (G vs. T, OR=0.881, 95% CI=0.798-0.972, P=0.012; GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.788, 95% CI=0.679-0.914, P=0.002; GG vs. TT, OR=0.683, 95% CI=0.498-0.937, P=0.018) and Caucasians (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.833, 95% CI=0.701-0.990, P=0.038; GG+GT vs. TT, OR=0.667, 95% CI=0.456-0.975, P=0.037; GG vs. TT, OR=0.636, 95% CI=0.433-0.934, P=0.021), respectively, and a possible association was found in Asian population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.709, 95% CI=0.503-0.998, P=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: STAT4 rs7574865 gene is IBD risk factor, and this gene polymorphism is associated with UC susceptibility, especially in Caucasians. To confirm these findings, further studies with more sample size are required for a definitive conclusion.},

   abstract = {Several epidemiological investigations have been conducted to evaluate the relationship between dietary fiber intake and inflammatory bowel diseases, but the results are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively summarize the evidence from observational studies. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Knowledge were searched for relevant articles published up to November 2014. The combined relative risks were calculated with the fixed- or random-effects model. Dose-response relationship was assessed using restricted cubic spline model. We hypothesized that the meta-analysis could yield a summary effect, which would indicate that dietary fiber intake could decrease the risk of ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease (CD). Overall, 8 articles involving 2 cohort studies, 1 nested case-control study, and 5 case-control studies were finally included in this study. The pooled relative risks with 95% confidence intervals of ulcerative colitis and CD for the highest vs lowest categories of dietary fiber intake were 0.80 (0.64-1.00) and 0.44 (0.29-0.69), respectively. A linear dose-response relationship was found between dietary fiber and CD risk, and the risk of CD decreased by 13% (P < .05) for every 10 g/d increment in fiber intake. The results from this meta-analysis indicated that the intake of dietary fiber was significantly associated with a decreased risk of inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abdominal x-ray (AXR) can identify complications in acute severe colitis (ASC) and may assist in selecting high-risk children for early aggressive treatment. We aimed to describe AXR findings in pediatric ASC and to explore radiological predictors of response to intravenous corticosteroid (IVCS) therapy. METHODS: A total of 56 children with ASC were included in a multicenter, retrospective 1-year cohort study (41% boys, mean age 12.1 +/- 4.2). Radiographs of responders to IVCS and those requiring second-line salvage therapy by discharge were analyzed independently by 2 blinded radiologists. RESULTS: A total of 33 responders to IVCS were compared with 23 nonresponders. The day-3 Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) score was significantly higher in nonresponders (63 +/- 16 vs 46 +/- 21, P = 0.001). The mean transverse colon luminal diameter was 30 +/- 16 mm in responders and 38 +/- 16 mm in nonresponders (P = 0.94). The upper range of transverse colonic diameter in children <12 years was approximately 40 mm, whereas in older children it was 60 mm as accepted in adults. Ulcerations and megacolon seen on AXR were associated with nonresponse to IVCS (P = 0.006 and 0.064, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of mucosal ulcerations and megacolon on AXR could be considered in the risk stratification of children with ASC for early aggressive treatment, together with the previously known day-3 and day-5 Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index scores, albumin, and C-reactive protein.},

   abstract = {Faecalibacterium prausnitzii depletion in intestinal diseases has been extensively reported, but little is known about intraspecies variability. This work aims to determine if subjects with gastrointestinal disease host mucosa-associated F. prausnitzii populations different from those hosted by healthy individuals. A new species-specific PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) method targeting the 16S rRNA gene was developed to fingerprint F. prausnitzii populations in biopsy specimens from 31 healthy control (H) subjects and 36 Crohn's disease (CD), 23 ulcerative colitis (UC), 6 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and 22 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The richness of F. prausnitzii subtypes was lower in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients than in H subjects. The most prevalent operational taxonomic units (OTUs) consisted of four phylotypes (OTUs with a 99% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity [OTU99]), which were shared by all groups of patients. Their distribution and the presence of some disease-specific F. prausnitzii phylotypes allowed us to differentiate the populations in IBD and CRC patients from that in H subjects. At the level of a minimum similarity of 97% (OTU97), two phylogroups accounted for 98% of the sequences. Phylogroup I was found in 87% of H subjects but in under 50% of IBD patients (P = 0.003). In contrast, phylogroup II was detected in >75% of IBD patients and in only 52% of H subjects (P = 0.005). This study reveals that even though the main members of the F. prausnitzii population are present in both H subjects and individuals with gut diseases, richness is reduced in the latter and an altered phylotype distribution exists between diseases. This approach may serve as a basis for addressing the suitability of F. prausnitzii phylotypes to be quantified as a putative biomarker of disease and depicting the importance of the loss of these subtypes in disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii comprises 2 phylogroups, whose abundance in healthy and diseased gut and in conjunction with Escherichia coli has not yet been studied. This work aims to determine the contribution of F. prausnitzii phylogroups I and II in intestinal disease and to assess their potential diagnostic usefulness as biomarkers for gut diseases. METHODS: Total F. prausnitzii, its phylogroups, and E. coli loads were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction targeting the 16S rRNA gene on biopsies from 31 healthy controls (H), 45 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 25 patients with ulcerative colitis, 10 patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and 20 patients with colorectal cancer. Data were normalized to total bacterial counts and analyzed according to patients' disease location and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Lower levels of both total F. prausnitzii and phylogroup I were found in subjects with CD, ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer (P < 0.001) compared with H subjects. Phylogroup I load was a better biomarker than total F. prausnitzii to discriminate subjects with gut disorders from H. Phylogroup II depletion was observed only in patients with CD (P < 0.001) and can be potentially applied to differentiate ulcerative pancolitis from colonic CD. No statistically significant correlation between E. coli and any of the 2 F. prausnitzii phylogroups was found in any group of patients or by inflammatory bowel disease location. Phylogroup I was lower in active patients with CD, whereas those CD with intestinal resection showed a reduction in phylogroup II. Treatments with mesalazine and immunosuppressants did not result in the recovery of F. prausnitzii phylogroups abundance. CONCLUSIONS: F. prausnitzii phylogroup I was depleted in CD, ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer, whereas phylogroup II was specifically reduced in CD. Quantification of F. prausnitzii phylogroups and E. coli may help to identify gut disorders and to classify inflammatory bowel disease location.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Food intolerance is believed to be a source of frequent medical problems in ulcerative colitis (UC), which closely correlate with patients' dietary pattern. Living in an underdeveloped area of China, residents in southwestern region have diverse dietary habits. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of food intolerance in the UC patients in this area and to discuss some of the possible risk factors leading to the condition. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Food antibodies in serum of 80 patients with active UC were determined by standard enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). This study examined the risk factors contributing to high titers of food antibodies and the dietary patterns correlating with food intolerance in these demographics. RESULTS: 83.8% of patients (67/80) were found to be seropositive for food intolerance. Patients of female, aged between 20 to 40 and the one who tended to have a high fat diet were tested to be highly seropositive (p<0.05). Neither spicy food intake nor the course the disease manifested any relationship with the presence of food intolerance (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Active UC patients in southwestern region of China have showed to be high seropositive in food intolerance, particularly in female and young patients. Dietary patterns with high in fat intake seem to have caused high prevalence of seropositivity in food intolerance. Although rice has been taken as staple food and the spicy food has been popular among citizen in this region, these foods have indicated to no effect on food intolerance in this study.},

   abstract = {Disruption of the homeostatic balance of intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (MQs) may contribute to inflammatory bowel disease. We characterized DC and MQ populations, including their ability to produce retinoic acid, in clinical material encompassing Crohn's ileitis, Crohn's colitis and ulcerative colitis (UC) as well as mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) draining these sites. Increased CD14(+)DR(int) MQs characterized inflamed intestinal mucosa while total CD141(+) or CD1c(+) DCs numbers were unchanged. However, CD103(+) DCs, including CD141(+)CD103(+) and CD1c(+)CD103(+) DCs, were reduced in inflamed intestine. In MLNs, two CD14(-) DC populations were identified: CD11c(int)HLADR(hi) and CD11c(hi)HLADR(int) cells. A marked increase of CD11c(hi)HLADR(int) DC, particularly DR(int)CD1c(+) DCs, characterized MLNs draining inflamed intestine. The fraction of DC and MQ populations expressing aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, reflecting retinoic acid synthesis, in UC colon, both in active disease and remission, were reduced compared to controls and inflamed Crohn's colon. In contrast, no difference in the frequency of ALDH(+) cells among blood precursors was detected between UC patients and non-inflamed controls. This suggests that ALDH activity in myeloid cells in the colon of UC patients, regardless of whether the disease is active or in remission, is influenced by the intestinal environment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy is used for treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). As approximately 30% of patients with UC do not benefit from the treatment, it is of clinical interest to identify biomarkers of response before therapy is initiated. AIM: To identify prognostic biomarkers of anti-TNF therapy response in anti-TNF therapy-naive patients with UC. METHODS: Peripheral blood cells were obtained from 56 patients with UC before therapy started. Thirty-four patients were included in an exploratory cohort and 22 patients in a validation cohort. Blood cells were stimulated in vitro with influenza vaccine with and without anti-TNF. T-cell surface receptor expression and cytokine release were determined (in total 17 variables). Treatment response was evaluated using the Mayo score 12-14 weeks after the first infusion. RESULTS: In the exploratory cohort, blood cells from the patients showed stronger anti-TNF-dependent suppression of T-cell surface receptor expression and cytokine secretion among therapy responders than nonresponders. In particular, anti-TNF suppressed the expression of CD25 on T cells and secretion of interleukin 5, to a higher degree in responders than in nonresponders. These variables were used to a create model to predict therapy outcome, which was confirmed in the validation cohort. Correct classification of future therapy response was achieved in 91% of the cases in the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: The effects of anti-TNF on cultured blood T cells, obtained before therapy started, predict treatment outcome in patients with UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The cellular mechanisms leading to infliximab therapy response in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are incompletely known. We therefore investigated early effects of infliximab therapy on monocytes and associated chemokines linked to clinical therapy response in UC patients. METHODS: Blood and biopsies were obtained from anti-TNF therapy-naive UC patients (n = 43) before (baseline) and during induction therapy with infliximab. Therapy response was evaluated at Week 14. Expression of monocyte activation markers and levels of chemokines in serum and biopsies were determined. Quantitative proteomic analysis was performed in cultured mucosal biopsies, and obtained data was validated in serum. RESULTS: In therapy responders, but not in non-responders, infliximab reduced blood monocyte expression of CD14 and CD86, 2 weeks after therapy commenced, relative to baseline. Serum CCL2 levels were decreased only among therapy responders at Week 2 and Week 14, relative to baseline. These data corresponded with lower levels of CD14, CD86 and CCL2 in intestinal tissue in responders as compared with non-responders at Week 14. Proteomic analysis of cultured biopsies showed that infliximab induced a reduction in Tenascin C that predicted downregulation of CCL2. Therapy responders, but not non-responders, had decreased serum Tenascin C levels at Week 2 and Week 14, relative to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab therapy response in UC patients is associated with reduced monocyte activation and serum levels of CCL2 2 weeks after therapy commencement. In therapy responders, infliximab influenced Tenascin C, which might be a regulator of CCL2 expression and important for induction of the clinical therapy response.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] therapy is used in patients with ulcerative colitis [UC], but not all patients respond to treatment. Antimicrobial peptides [AMPs] and the gut microbiota are essential for gut homeostasis and may be important for treatment outcome. The aim of this study was to determine AMP and microbiota profiles in patients with UC before anti-TNF therapy start and correlate these data to treatment outcome. METHODS: Serum and biopsies were obtained from UC patients naive to biological therapy [n = 56] before anti-TNF therapy start [baseline]. Fecal samples were taken at baseline and Weeks 2 and 6. Quantitative proteomic analysis was performed in mucosal biopsies. Expression of AMPs and cytokines was determined in biopsies and serum. Microbiota analysis of fecal samples was performed using GA-map Dysbiosis Test and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction [rtPCR]. Treatment response was evaluated 12-14 weeks after baseline. RESULTS: At baseline, proteomic analysis of biopsies showed that treatment responders and non-responders had differential expression of AMPs. Eleven AMP and AMP-related genes were analysed by rtPCR in mucosal biopsies and could together discriminate responders from non-responders at baseline. The most important nominators for response were increased expression of defensin 5 and eosinophilic cationic protein. Microbiota analysis revealed lower dysbiosis indexes and higher abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in responders compared with non-responders at baseline. Also, abundance of F. prausnitzii increased during induction therapy in responders. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF therapy responders and non-responders display distinctly separate patterns of mucosal AMP expression and gut microbiota before treatment start. This indicates that intestinal antimicrobial/microbial composition can influence treatment outcome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and encompass Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD are often associated with extraintestinal manifestations affecting multiple organs including the liver. Increased levels of serum aminotransferases, possibly related to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, constitute one of the most frequently described IBD-related liver diseases. The PNPLA3 I148M substitution is a major common genetic determinant of hepatic fat content and progression to chronic liver disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether carriers of PNPLA3 148M allele with IBD have higher risk of liver steatosis and increase in transaminases levels. METHODS: The PNPLA3 I148M (rs738409) genotype was performed by Taqman assays in 158 individuals from Southern Italy (namely, Catanzaro cohort) and in 207 individuals from Northern Italy (namely, Milan cohort) with a definite diagnosis of IBD. Demographic and clinical data and also alanine transaminase levels were collected for both cohorts. The Catanzaro cohort underwent liver evaluation by sonography and liver stiffness and controlled attenuation parameter measurements by transient elastography. RESULTS: Here, we show for the first time that carriers of the PNPLA3 148M allele with IBD have a greater risk of hepatic steatosis (odds ratio, 2.9, and confidence interval, 1.1-7.8), higher controlled attenuation parameter values (P = 0.029), and increased circulating alanine transaminase (P = 0.035) in the Catanzaro cohort. We further confirm the higher alanine transaminase levels in the Milan cohort (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that PNPLA3 148M carriers with IBD have higher susceptibility to hepatic steatosis and liver damage.},

   abstract = {AIM: The study aimed to evaluate high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) as a diagnostic and predictive marker in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). MATERIAL/METHODS: Medical history of 106 patients with IBD revealed hsCRP concentrations at diagnosis and during the follow-up period. RESULTS: The study showed that the majority of investigated patients had elevated hsCRP concentrations at diagnosis, although the mean concentration was much higher in the group of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) than the group with ulcerative colitis (UC) (P<0.001). The overall decrease in mean hsCRP concentration observed during the follow-up period was larger in the group of CD patients. The analysis showed a correlation between hsCRP concentrations at diagnosis and risk of surgery in the group of CD patients (r=0.408, P=0.002), but not in the group of UC patients. In a logistic regression analysis, surgery in CD patients was associated with age (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.8-1.0, P=0.05) and hsCRP concentration (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.0-1.04, P=0.03) at diagnosis. DISCUSSION: HsCRP might be a useful diagnostic marker in differentiating active IBD from other diseases. Particularly important however seems to be the predictive value of hsCRP at diagnosis in prognosing the clinical outcome of the disease in CD patients.},

   abstract = {Many immune-based intestinal disorders, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, as well as other illnesses, may have the intestines as an initial cause or aggravator in the development of diseases, even apparently not correlating directly to the intestine. Diabetes, obesity, multiple sclerosis, depression, and anxiety are examples of other illnesses discussed in the literature. In parallel, importance of the gut microbiota in intestinal homeostasis and immunologic conflict between tolerance towards commensal microorganisms and combat of pathogens is well known. Recent researches show that the immune system, when altered by the gut microbiota, influences the state in which these diseases are presented in the patient directly and indirectly. At the present moment, a considerable number of investigations about this subject have been performed and published. However, due to difficulties on correlating information, several speculations and hypotheses are generated. Thus, the present review aims at bringing together how these interactions work-gut microbiota, immune system, and their influence in the neuroimmune system.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We developed a validated index for assessing histological disease activity in UC and established its responsiveness. METHODS: Two hundred biopsies were scored. The outcome was the Global Visual Evaluation (GVE). Eight histological features were tested. The Nancy index was developed by multiple linear regression and bootstrap process to create an index that best matched the GVE. Goodness of fit was assessed by the adjusted R squared (adjusted R2). The second step was the validation of the index: 100 biopsies were scored for the Nancy index by three pathologists from different centres. Inter-reader reliability was evaluated for each reader. The relationship between the change of the Nancy index and the Geboes index was assessed to assess the responsiveness. RESULTS: After backward selection with bootstrap validation, 3/8 items were selected: ulceration (adjusted R2=0.55), acute inflammatory infiltrate (adjusted R2=0.88) and chronic inflammatory infiltrate (adjusted R2=0.79). The Nancy index is defined by a 5-level classification ranging from grade 0 (absence of significant histological disease activity) to grade 4 (severely active disease). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the intrareader reliability was 0.88 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.92) and the index had good inter-reader reliability (ICC=0.86 (0.81 to 0.99)). The correlation between the Nancy index and the Geboes score or the GVE was very good. The index had a good responsiveness with a high correlation between changes in the Geboes score and changes in the Nancy index (0.910 (0.813 to 0.955)). CONCLUSIONS: A three descriptor histological index has been validated for use in clinical practice and clinical trials.},

   abstract = {Over the last 10-15 years, our understanding of the composition and functions of the human gut microbiota has increased exponentially. To a large extent, this has been due to new 'omic' technologies that have facilitated large-scale analysis of the genetic and metabolic profile of this microbial community, revealing it to be comparable in influence to a new organ in the body and offering the possibility of a new route for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, it might be more accurate to think of it like an immune system: a collection of cells that work in unison with the host and that can promote health but sometimes initiate disease. This review gives an update on the current knowledge in the area of gut disorders, in particular metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disease, liver disease, IBD and colorectal cancer. The potential of manipulating the gut microbiota in these disorders is assessed, with an examination of the latest and most relevant evidence relating to antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols and faecal microbiota transplantation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Both science and patients associate diet with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. There is no doubt that links between IBD and diet are numerous, based on both epidemiological studies and experimental studies. However, scientific evidence to support dietary advice is currently lacking, and dietary counselling for IBD patients is often limited in clinical practice to the improvement of nutrient intake. This review aimed to focus on both patient's beliefs about and molecular mechanisms for crosstalk between nutrients and inflammation. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed was performed to identify relevant studies on diet and/or nutrients and their role in IBD. Pubmed [from inception to January 20, 2016] was searched using the terms: 'Crohn', 'colitis',' intestinal epithelial cells', and a list of terms relating to diet or numerous specific nutrients. Terms associated with nutrients were individually tested in the context of IBD. Reference lists from studies selected were manually searched to identify further relevant reports. Manuscripts about diet in the context of IBD from basic science, epidemiological studies, or clinical trials were selected and reviewed. Only articles published in English were included. RESULTS: Epidemiological studies highlight the key role of diet in IBD development, and many IBD patients report diet as a triggering factor in relapse of disease. In addition, we present research on the impact of nutrients on innate immunity. CONCLUSION: Diet may offer an alternative approach to restoring deficient innate immunity in IBD, and this may be the scientific rationale for providing dietary counselling for IBD patients.},

   abstract = {The present study was designed to elucidate the protective effects of dietary apigenin (API) enrichment in a chronic colitis model induced by DSS in mice. Inflammatory mediators and the possible role of canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathways in the beneficial effects of API under chronic inflammatory conditions were also explored. Six-week-old mice were randomized in four dietary groups: sham and control groups received standard diet (SD), and other two groups were fed with API at 0.1%. After 30days, all groups except sham received 3% DSS in drinking water for 5days followed by a regime of 21days of water. Our results revealed that dietary API supplementation decreased the macroscopic and microscopic damage signs of colitis; also, it was capable to down-regulate mPGES, COX-2 and iNOS enzyme colonic expressions and to decrease serum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-3) levels. Similarly, API diet reduced IL-1beta and TNF-alpha proinflammatory cytokine secretions in primary LPS-stimulated splenocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that API anti-inflammatory activity was related with an inhibition of both canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathways by decreasing proinflammatory IL-1beta and IL-18 cytokine levels as a consequence of regulation of cleaved caspase-1 and caspase-11 enzymes. We conclude that API supplement might provide a basis for developing a new dietary strategy for the prevention of chronic ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth failure and delayed puberty are well known features of children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in addition to the chronic course of the disease. Urinary metabonomics was applied in order to better understand metabolic changes between healthy and IBD children. METHODS: 21 Pediatric patients with IBD (mean age 14.8 years, 8 males) were enrolled from the Pediatric Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic over two years. Clinical and biological data were collected at baseline, 6, and 12 months. 27 healthy children (mean age 12.9 years, 16 males) were assessed at baseline. Urine samples were collected at each visit and subjected to (1)H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. RESULTS: Using (1)H NMR metabonomics, we determined that urine metabolic profiles of IBD children differ significantly from healthy controls. Metabolic differences include central energy metabolism, amino acid, and gut microbial metabolic pathways. The analysis described that combined urinary urea and phenylacetylglutamine-two readouts of nitrogen metabolism-may be relevant to monitor metabolic status in the course of disease. CONCLUSION: Non-invasive sampling of urine followed by metabonomic profiling can elucidate and monitor the metabolic status of children in relation to disease status. Further developments of omic-approaches in pediatric research might deliver novel nutritional and metabolic hypotheses.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few case reports describe the clinical features of pancreatic involvement in inflammatory bowel disease. AIM: To investigate prevalence and disease course of inflammatory bowel disease children with pancreatitis and with exclusive hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. METHODS: We used a web-registry to retrospectively identify paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients with hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. Participants were re-evaluated at 6 months and 1 year. RESULTS: From a total of 649 paediatric patients, we found 27 with hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia (4.1%). Eleven patients (1.6%) fulfilled diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis. Female gender was significantly associated with acute pancreatitis (p=0.04). Twenty-five children (92.5%) had colonic disease. At 6 months 1/11 children with acute pancreatitis (9%) showed acute recurrent pancreatitis, while 1 patient (9%) had persistent hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. At 12 months, 1 patient showed chronic pancreatitis (9.1%). Of the 16 children with exclusive hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia, 4 developed acute pancreatitis (25%), while 1 patient (6.2%) still presented exclusive hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia at 6 months. At 12 months, 11/16 patients (68.7%) reached a remission of pancreatic involvement, whereas 5 remaining patients (32.3%) had persistent hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. CONCLUSIONS: In inflammatory bowel disease children, acute pancreatitis is more common in colonic disease and in female gender. Pancreatic function should be monitored, considering that pancreatic damage may evolve.},

   abstract = {Probiotics and prebiotics, mainly commercialised as food ingredients and also as supplements, are considered highly profitable niche markets. However, in recent years, the food industry has suffered from a series of health claim restrictions on probiotics and prebiotics in many parts of the world, including those made by the European Food Safety Authority. Therefore, we reviewed the core benefits of probiotic and prebiotic consumption on health. A number of studies have examined the prevention and/or management of intestinal infections, respiratory tract infections, CVD, osteoporosis, urogenital infections, cavities, periodontal disease and halitosis, allergic reactions, inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori gastric infections. In fact, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in human microbiota and immune system modulation by probiotics and prebiotics relies on continuous efforts to establish suitable biomarkers of health and diseases risk factors for the design of clinical trials required for health claim approval. In spite of the promising results, the performance of large, long-term, well-planned, well-aligned clinical studies is crucial to provide more reliability and a more solid basis for the outcomes achieved and to support the potential use of probiotics and prebiotics in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is a classic anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. N-acetyltransferase (NAT) enzymes convert 5-ASA to its metabolite N-acetyl-5-ASA, and it is unresolved whether 5-ASA or N-acetyl-5-ASA is the effective therapeutic molecule. We previously demonstrated that colonic production of N-acetyl-5-ASA (NAT activity) is decreased in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Our hypothesis is that 5-ASA is the therapeutic molecule to improve colitis, with the corollary that altered NAT activity affects drug efficacy. Since varying clinical effectiveness of 5-ASA has been reported, we also ask if NAT activity varies with inflammation in pediatric or adult patients. METHODS: Acute colonic inflammation was induced in C57BL/6 NAT wild-type (WT) or knockout mice, using 3.5% dextran sulfate sodium (w/v) concurrent with 5-ASA treatment. Adult and pediatric rectosigmoid biopsies were collected from control or patients with ulcerative colitis. Tissue was analyzed for NAT and myeloperoxidase activity. RESULTS: Dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis was of similar severity in both NAT WT and knockout mice, and NAT activity was significantly decreased in NAT WT mice. In the setting of colitis, 5-ASA significantly restored colon length and decreased myeloperoxidase activity in NAT knockout but not in WT mice. Myeloperoxidase activity negatively correlated with NAT activity in pediatric patients, but correlation was not observed in adult patients. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation decreases NAT activity in the colon of mice and human pediatric patients. Decreased NAT activity enhances the therapeutic effect of 5-ASA in mice. A NAT activity assay could be useful to help predict the efficacy of 5-ASA therapy.},

   abstract = {Previous studies have shown that ghrelin reduces colonic inflammation induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and dextran sodium sulfate. In the present study we determined the effect of treatment with ghrelin on the course of acetic acid-induced colitis in rats. Rectal administration of 3% acetic acid solution led to induction of colitis in all animals. Damage of the colonic wall was accompanied by an increase in mucosal concentration of pro-inflammatory interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), as well mucosal activity of myeloperoxidase. Moreover, induction of colitis led to a reduction in colonic blood flow and DNA synthesis. Administration of ghrelin after induction of colitis led to faster regeneration of the colonic wall and reduction in colonic levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and myeloperoxidase. In addition, treatment with ghrelin improved mucosal DNA synthesis and blood flow. Our study disclosed that ghrelin exhibits a strong anti-inflammatory and healing effect in acetic acid-induced colitis. Our current observation in association with previous findings that ghrelin exhibits curative effect in trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid- and dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis suggest that therapeutic effect of ghrelin in the colon is universal and independent of the primary cause of colitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Diverting ileostomy is used as a temporizing therapy in patients with perianal Crohn disease; however, little data exist regarding its use for colonic disease. The primary aim of the present study was to determine the role of diversion in severe refractory colonic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a pediatric population. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients who underwent diverting ileostomy at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from 2000 to 2014 for the management of severe, refractory colonic IBD. Clinical variables were compared in the 1 year before ileostomy and 1 year after diversion. Surgical and disease outcomes including changes in diagnosis were reviewed through 2015. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients underwent diverting ileostomy for refractory colonic disease. Initial diagnoses were Crohn disease in 10 (42%), ulcerative colitis in 1 (4%), and IBD-unclassified in 13 patients (54%). Comparing data before and after surgery, there were statistically significant improvements in height and weight velocities, height velocity z score, blood transfusion requirement, hemoglobin, and hospitalization rates. Chronic steroid use decreased from 71% to 22%. At the conclusion of the study, 10 patients had undergone subsequent colectomy, 7 had successful bowel reanastomosis, and 7 remain diverted. Seven patients (29%) had a change in diagnosis. There were 13 surgical complications in 7 subjects, including prolapse reduction, stoma revision, and resection of ischemic bowel. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients with refractory colonic IBD, diverting ileostomy can be a successful intervention to induce clinical stability. Importantly, diversion is a steroid-sparing therapy and allows additional time to clarify the diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perineal wound complications after ileoanal pouch excision remain a significant cause of morbidity. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to describe the incidence, outcomes, and predictors of perineal wound complications after pouch excision. DESIGN: This was a retrospective medical chart review. SETTINGS: The study was conducted in a single clinical institution. PATIENTS: Patients who underwent pouch excision at our institution from July 1992 through July 2012 were identified. Patient and perioperative variables were reviewed. Multivariate and univariate analyses were undertaken. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perineal wound (including perineal wound infection and persistent perineal sinus [nonhealing by 6 months]) and perineal hernia were measured. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients (mean age, 46 years; 42.6% men) with familial adenomatous polyposis (10.6%), mucosal ulcerative colitis (61.7%), or Crohn's disease (27.7%) underwent pouch excision, including 36.2% for IPAA-related sepsis (presacral abscess; perineal-, sacral-, or pouch-vaginal fistula; and anastomotic defect), 44.7% for pouch dysfunction, 10.6% for refractory pouchitis, and 8.5% for neoplasia. Fourteen (29.8%) developed perineal wound complications, including 100% perineal wound infection, 28.6% persistent perineal sinus, and 7.1% perineal hernia. Perineal wound infection was associated with delayed healing (>6 weeks; 71.4% vs 24.2%; p = 0.002) and IPAA-related sepsis (28.6% vs 0%; p = 0.001). Patients with and without perineal wound complications were similar in age, diagnoses, fecal diversion, immunosuppression, comorbid conditions, nutrition, and surgical variables. Most patients underwent intersphincteric dissection (87.2%) with primary perineal closure (97.0%). Perineal wound complications were significantly associated with IPAA-related sepsis as an indication for pouch excision (57.1% vs 27.2%; p = 0.05), intraoperative pouch perforation (35.7% vs 9.1%, p =0.03), and smoking (21.4% vs 3.0%; p = 0.04). IPAA-related sepsis and a current smoking status (OR, 19.3 [95% CI, 1.8 -488.1]) are significant independent predictors on multivariate logistic regression (OR, 6.4 [95% CI, 1.4-30.2]) of perineal wound complications. All of the patients with persistent perineal sinus achieved successful healing at a median of 734 days (range, 363-2182 days), requiring a median of 1.5 procedures. LIMITATIONS: This was a single-center retrospective review with a small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative IPAA-related sepsis and current smoking are significant risk factors for perineal wound complications after pouch excision.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are heterogeneous disorders with complex aetiology. Quantitative genetic studies suggest that only a small proportion of the disease variance observed in IBD is accounted for by genetic variation, indicating a potential role for differential epigenetic regulation in disease aetiology. The aim of this study was to assess genome-wide DNA methylation changes specifically associated with ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and IBD activity. METHODS: DNA methylation was quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 149 IBD cases (61 UC, 88 CD) and 39 controls using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Technical and functional validation was performed using pyrosequencing and the real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cross-tissue replication of the top differentially methylated positions (DMPs) was tested in colonic mucosa tissue samples obtained from paediatric IBD cases and controls. RESULTS: A total of 3196 probes were differentially methylated between CD cases and controls, while 1481 probes were differentially methylated between UC cases and controls. There was considerable (45%) overlap between UC and CD DMPs. The top-ranked IBD-associated PBMC differentially methylated region (promoter region of TRIM39-RPP2) was also significantly hypomethylated in colonic mucosa from paediatric UC patients. In addition, we confirmed TRAF6 hypermethylation using pyrosequencing and found reduced TRAF6 gene expression in PBMCs of IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide new insights into differential epigenetic regulation of genes and molecular pathways, which may contribute to the pathogenesis and activity of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D exerts anti-inflammatory actions both in vitro and in murine models of colitis. In previous studies, we demonstrated that vitamin D protects against the development of colitis by maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate whether deficient serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations are associated with increased mucosal inflammation, a loss of epithelial junctional proteins, and an increase in mucosal inflammatory cytokines in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). DESIGN: We prospectively enrolled 230 subjects with UC. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were compared with the Mayo endoscopic score, the total Mayo score, and histologic activity. Colonic mucosal expression concentrations of vitamin D receptor (VDR), E-cadherin, zonula occluden 1 (ZO-1), occludin, claudin-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) were compared between dichotomous groups with low or high serum 25(OH)D concentrations. RESULTS: The mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 21.8 ng/mL. Subjects stratified by concentrations included 12.6% >/=30 ng/mL, 45.6% >/=20 to <30 ng/mL, 37.4% >/=10 to <20 ng/mL, and 4.4% <10 ng/mL. There was an inverse association between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and mucosal inflammation as assessed by the Mayo endoscopy score (P = 0.01), disease activity as indicated by the total Mayo score (P = 0.001), and histologic activity (P = 0.02). A serum 25(OH)D concentration <20 ng/mL was associated with decreased mucosal transcript and protein expression concentrations of VDR, E-cadherin, and occludin as well as decreased protein expression of ZO-1, whereas TNF-alpha and IL-8 mucosal transcript expression concentrations were increased. CONCLUSIONS: In UC patients, serum 25(OH)D concentration is inversely correlated with mucosal inflammation and disease activity. These results, coupled with the findings that serum 25(OH)D concentrations correlate with the mucosal expression of VDR as well as epithelial junction proteins and inversely with proinflammatory cytokines, suggest that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to UC inflammation by disrupting epithelial barrier function.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Managing patients with IBD who are refractory or have contraindications to standard therapies is challenging. Many will lose response, become intolerant to treatment, or develop infections with contraindication for immunosuppression. Therefore, alternative therapies, such as the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), could be used to manage patients in these difficult cases. METHODS: Data were extracted retrospectively from the electronic medical records at Vanderbilt University on patients with IBD who received IVIg (February 2011-June 2013). Patients were treated with IVIg 0.4 g.kg.d for 3 consecutive days and then 0.4 g/kg once monthly. The dose was increased to 0.4 g/kg biweekly for loss of response or partial response. Clinical response was defined as decreasing the Harvey-Bradshaw Index >/=3 points or improvement in C-reactive protein >25%. Clinical remission was defined as Harvey-Bradshaw Index score <5, no hospitalizations or surgeries after IVIg, or symptom resolution. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with IBD received IVIg. Seventeen patients received IVIg for failure of standard treatment. Six patients received IVIg during active infection. Two patients had histoplasmosis, 1 patient had tuberculosis, and 2 patients had pulmonary fungal infections. One patient with ulcerative colitis was given IVIg for recurrent Clostridium difficile. Nine patients required dose escalation after median 153 days (30-360). Ninteen patients (79%) had a response or remission. Sixteen (67%) had a response and 3 (12.5%) obtained remission with IVIg. C-reactive protein decreased significantly after treatment (19 mg/dL [0.1-77] to 7.5 [0.2-20]), P < 0.05. Harvey-Bradshaw Index scores improved (8 [0-19] to 6 [0-17]), P = not significant. Of note, 62.5% had endoscopic improvement after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: IVIg is safe and effective in the short-term management of patients with IBD when standard therapies are contraindicated.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate whether accelerated catabolism of ganglioside and decreased ganglioside content contribute to the etiology of pro-inflammatory intestinal disease. METHODS: Intestinal mucosa from terminal ileum or colon was obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis or inflammatory Crohn's disease (n = 11) undergoing bowel resection and compared to control samples of normal intestine from patients with benign colon polyps (n = 6) and colorectal cancer (n = 12) in this observational case-control study. Gangliosides and phospholipids of intestinal mucosa were characterized by class and ceramide or fatty acid composition using liquid chromatography triple-quad mass spectrometry. Content and composition of ganglioside classes GM1, GM3, GD3, GD1a, GT1 and GT3 were compared among subject groups. Content and composition of phospholipid classes phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine were compared among subject groups. Unsaturation index of individual ganglioside and phospholipid classes was computed and compared among subject groups. Ganglioside catabolism enzymes beta-hexosaminidase A (HEXA) and sialidase-3 (NEU3) were measured in intestinal mucosa using western blot and compared among subject groups. RESULTS: Relative GM3 ganglioside content was 2-fold higher (P < 0.05) in intestine from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared to control intestine. The quantity of GM3 and ratio of GM3/GD3 was also higher in IBD intestine than control tissue (P < 0.05). Control intestine exhibited 3-fold higher (P < 0.01) relative GD1a ganglioside content than IBD intestine. GD3 and GD1a species of ganglioside containing three unsaturated bonds were present in control intestine, but were not detected in IBD intestine. The relative content of PC containing more than two unsaturated bonds was 30% lower in IBD intestine than control intestine (P < 0.05). The relative content of HEXA in IBD intestine was increased 1.7-fold (P < 0.05) and NEU3 was increased 8.3-fold (P < 0.01) compared to normal intestine. Intestinal mucosa in IBD is characterized by increased GM3 content, decreased GD1a, and a reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acid constituents in GD3, GD1a and PC. CONCLUSION: This study suggests a new paradigm by proposing that IBD occurs as a consequence of increased metabolism of specific gangliosides.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies reveal associations between intestinal ganglioside content and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since a low level of ganglioside is associated with higher production of proinflammatory signals in the intestine, it is important to determine safety and bioavailability of dietary ganglioside for application as a potential therapeutic agent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy volunteers (HVs; n = 18) completed an 8-week supplementation study to demonstrate safety and bioavailabity of ganglioside consumption. HVs were randomized to consume a milk fat fraction containing 43 mg/d ganglioside or placebo, and patients with IBD (n = 5) consumed ganglioside supplement in a small pilot study. Plasma gangliosides were characterized using reverse-phase liquid chromatography-QQQ mass spectrometry. Intestinal permeability was assessed by oral lactulose/mannitol, and quality of life was assessed by quality of life in the IBD questionnaire. RESULTS: There were no adverse events associated with dietary ganglioside intake. Ganglioside consumption increased ( P < .05) plasma content of total GD3 by 35% over 8 weeks. HVs consuming ganglioside exhibited a 19% decrease in intestinal permeability ( P = .04). Consumption of ganglioside was associated with a 39% increase ( P < .01) in emotional health and a 36% improvement ( P < .02) in systemic symptoms in patients with IBD. CONCLUSION: Impaired intestinal integrity characteristic of IBD results in increased permeability to bacterial antigens and decreased nutrient absorption. Intestinal integrity may be improved by dietary treatment with specific species of ganglioside. Ganglioside is a safe, bioavailable dietary compound that can be consumed to potentially improve quality of life in patients with IBD and treat other disorders involving altered ganglioside metabolism. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02139709.},

Any dysfunction of this boundary layer that disturbs the homeostatic equilibrium between the internal and external environments may initiate and sustain a biochemical cascade that results in inflammation of the intestine. Key to such dysfunction are genetic, microbial and other environmental factors that, singularly or in combination, result in chronic inflammation that is symptomatic of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

In recent years, therapeutic goal evolved from clinical remission to mucosal healing and deep remission. In order to achieve remission, it is important to appropriately choose and use available drugs. Therefore, anti-TNFalpha treatment should be rapidly used for severe and at-risk patients, sometimes in association with thiopurines or methotrexate. The monitoring of through levels and antibodies to anti-TNFalpha is relevant to optimize the treatment and to reduce drug inefficacy. However, the development of new drugs is required to offer alternative tools to severe and refractory patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eosinophils are implicated in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. AIMS: To evaluate the magnitude of mucosal and blood eosinophils in newly diagnosed pediatric ulcerative colitis patients and its significance in predicting disease outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated colorectal biopsies of 96 pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis and 50 age- and sex-matched controls. Samples were taken from diseased areas of the colon and examined by a gastrointestinal pathologist. The most inflamed site was used for assessment of mucosal eosinophils. RESULTS: Samples from 96 diagnostic and 70 follow-up colonoscopies were evaluated. Median age was 13.3 years (IQR 10.1-15.3). Median duration of follow-up was 12.8 years (IQR 7.2-17.1). Median number of tissue eosinophils at diagnosis was 45 (IQR 22-73) compared to 10 eosinophils (IQR 8-25) during histologic remission (p<0.0001). Peripheral absolute eosinophil counts correlated with tissue inflammation and eosinophilia (p=0.001). Mucosal eosinophilic infiltration (p=0.02) and peripheral eosinophilia (p=0.04) was associated with clinical severity at diagnosis. Multivariate analysis showed that severe eosinophilic infiltration is associated with corticosteroid therapy following diagnosis (p=0.04) but not with long-term risk for step-up therapy or colectomy. CONCLUSION: Tissue and peripheral eosinophilia correlate with ulcerative colitis severity at diagnosis and with short-term corticosteroid requirement but not with long-term outcomes.},

   abstract = {Objective In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), the relationship between the initial endoscopic findings and the response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antibodies remains unclear. We herein evaluated the potential of endoscopic assessment using the ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity (UCEIS) to predict the response to anti-TNF-alpha antibodies. Methods We enrolled 64 patients with UC undergoing anti-TNF-alpha maintenance therapy with infliximab (IFX) or adalimumab (ADA) between April 2010 and March 2015. Anti-TNF-alpha trough levels were determined by ELISA. Endoscopic disease activity was assessed using the UCEIS. Results The clinical response rate at 8 weeks was 77.4% for IFX and 66.7% for ADA. Serum albumin levels were significantly higher and the UCEIS bleeding descriptor before treatment was significantly lower in the responders than in the non-responders (p < 0.05 each). The CRP levels at 2 weeks were significantly lower in the responders (p < 0.001). The serum albumin levels before treatment were significantly higher and the UCEIS erosions and ulcers descriptor was significantly lower in the mucosal healing group than in the non-mucosal healing group (p < 0.05 each). A significant and negative correlation between the trough levels of anti-TNF-alpha antibodies and the UCEIS descriptors was observed. The trough levels of anti-TNF-alpha antibodies to achieve mucosal healing were 2.7 mug/mL for IFX and 10.3 mug/mL for ADA. Conclusions The UCEIS score, as well as some clinical markers (serum albumin and CRP levels), is useful for the prediction of the treatment outcome of UC patients in response to anti-TNF-alpha antibodies.},

   abstract = {Eosinophils are traditionally studied in the context of type 2 immune responses. However, recent studies highlight key innate immune functions for eosinophils especially in colonic inflammation. Surprisingly, molecular pathways regulating innate immune activities of eosinophil are largely unknown. We have recently shown that the CD300f is highly expressed by colonic eosinophils. Nonetheless, the role of CD300f in governing innate immune eosinophil activities is ill-defined. RNA sequencing of 162 pediatric Crohn's disease patients revealed upregulation of multiple Cd300 family members, which correlated with the presence of severe ulcerations and inflammation. Increased expression of CD300 family receptors was also observed in active ulcerative colitis (UC) and in mice following induction of experimental colitis. Specifically, the expression of CD300f was dynamically regulated in monocytes and eosinophils. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-treated Cd300f-/- mice exhibit attenuated disease activity and histopathology in comparison with DSS-treated wild type (WT). Decreased disease activity in Cd300f-/- mice was accompanied with reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and nearly abolished production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Monocyte depletion and chimeric bone marrow transfer experiments revealed a cell-specific requirement for CD300f in innate immune activation of eosinophils. Collectively, we uncover a new pathway regulating innate immune activities of eosinophils, a finding with significant implications in eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal diseases.},

Pre-immunization was carried out with cBSA in BALB/c mice and repeated (cBSA, 13 mg/kg, 3 times/week, i.v.) for 6 weeks to induce glomerulonephritis which was confirmed by the presence of severe proteinuria. The effect of VA (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) and its combination with MP (12.5 mg/kg, p.o.) was assessed in the nephrotic disease model. Treatment with VA decreased inflammatory nephrotic injury as evidenced by decreased proteinuria, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum IgG1 and TNF-alpha levels. Co-administration of VA with MP showed an improvement in the immunohistochemistry of glomerular nephrin and podocin. The present results indicate that VA has a nephroprotective effect in the management of autoimmune nephritis. Drug Dev Res 77 : 171-179, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This study aims to evaluate the action of LA and/or NAC, on oxidative stress and inflammation markers in colonic and hepatic rat tissues with mild UC, induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) (2% w/v). LA and/or NAC (100 mg.kg.day-1, each) were given, once a day, in the diet, in a pretreatment phase (7 days) and during UC induction (5 days). Colitis induction was confirmed by histological and biochemical analyses (high performance liquid chromatography, spectrophotometry, and Multiplex(R)). A redox imbalance occurred before an immunological disruption in the colon. NAC led to a decrease in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and myeloperoxidase activity. In the liver, DSS did not cause damage but treatments with both antioxidants were potentially harmful, with LA increasing MDA and LA + NAC increasing H2O2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and transaminases. In summary, NAC exhibited the highest colonic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, while LA + NAC caused hepatic damage.},

This systematic review discusses approaches, challenges and perspectives into the use of nontraditional antioxidant therapy on IBD, including natural and synthetic compounds in both human and animal models. One hundred and thirty four papers were identified, of which only four were evaluated in humans. Some of the challenges identified in this review can shed light on this fact: lack of standardization of OS biomarkers, absence of safety data and clinical trials for the chemicals and biological molecules, as well as the fact that most of the compounds were not repeatedly tested in several situations, including acute and chronic colitis. This review hopes to stimulate researchers to become more involved in this fruitful area, to warrant investigation of novel, alternative and efficacious antioxidant-based therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) may impair quality of life (QoL) in paediatric patients. We aimed to evaluate in a nationwide cohort whether patients experience QoL in a different way when compared with their parents. METHODS: Sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics were prospectively acquired from paediatric patients and their parents included in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study. Disease activity was evaluated by the Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI). We assessed QoL using the KIDSCREEN questionnaire. The QoL domains were analysed and compared between children and parents according to type of disease, parents' age, origin, education and marital status. RESULTS: We included 110 children and parents (59 Crohn's disease [CD], 45 ulcerative colitis [UC], 6 IBD unclassified [IBDU]). There was no significant difference in QoL between CD and UC/IBDU, whether the disease was active or in remission. Parents perceived overall QoL, as well as 'mood', 'family' and 'friends' domains, lower than the children themselves, independently of their place of birth and education. However, better concordance was found on 'school performance' and 'physical activity' domains. Marital status and age of parents significantly influenced the evaluation of QoL. Mothers and fathers being married or cohabiting perceived significantly lower mood, family and friends domains than their children, whereas mothers living alone had a lower perception of the friends domain; fathers living alone had a lower perception of family and mood subscores. CONCLUSION: Parents of Swiss paediatric IBD patients significantly underestimate overall QoL and domains of QoL of their children independently of origin and education.},

Our aim was to investigate the short-term disease outcome and medication during the first year in a paediatric incident cohort from Hungary. In addition, association laboratory markers and disease activity indices with short-term disease outcome and medication were analysed. METHODS: From January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010, demographic data and clinical characteristics of newly diagnosed paediatric patients with IBD < 18 years of age were prospectively recorded. RESULTS: A total of 420 patients were identified (Crohn disease [CD] 266 and ulcerative colitis [UC] 124). Initially, 48% (124/256) of the patients with CD had moderate-to-severe disease (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] > 31), and this rate decreased to 2.1% at 1-year follow-up.

Terminal ileal involvement correlated with higher initial C-reactive protein (CRP) (P = 0.021) and initial PCDAI (P = 0.026). In UC, elevated CRP (P = 0.002) was associated with disease extension. CRP and PCDAI at diagnosis were associated with the need for immunomodulators at 1 year in children with CD. Initial CRP was also associated with the need for immunomodulators in patients with UC at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: At diagnosis, half of the patients with IBD had moderate-to-severe disease, and this rate decreased to <10% after 1 year. Initial CRP and PCDAI were related to the need for aggressive therapy in CD.},

   abstract = {Dietary influences may affect microbiome composition and host immune responses, thereby modulating propensity toward inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs): Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Dietary n-6 fatty acids have been associated with UC in prospective studies. However, the critical developmental period when (n-6) consumption may induce UC is not known. We examined the effects of transiently increased n-6 consumption during pediatric development on subsequent dextran-sulfate-sodium (DSS)-induced acute murine colitis. The animals transiently became obese then rapidly lost this phenotype. Interestingly, mice were protected against DSS colitis 40 days after n-6 consumption. The transient high n-6-induced protection against colitis was fat type- and dietary reversal-dependent and could be transferred to germ-free mice by fecal microbiota transplantation. We also detected decreased numbers of chemokine receptor (Cxcr)5(+) CD4(+) T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of transiently n-6-fed mice. Further experiments revealed that anti-chemokine ligand (Cxcl)13 (the ligand of Cxcr5) antibody treatment decreased DSS colitis severity, implicating the importance of the Cxcr5-Cxcl13 pathway in mammalian colitis. Consecutively, we found elevated CXCL13 concentrations (CD: 1.8-fold, P = 0.0077; UC: 1.9-fold, P = 0.056) in the serum of untreated pediatric IBD patients. The human serologic observations supported the translational relevance of our findings.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Esophageal Crohn's disease is reported as a rare manifestation, although its prevalence may be underestimated because upper endoscopies are not routinely performed in asymptomatic adults. Tofacitinib, an oral janus kinase inhibitor, is a new biologic that has shown promise in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and may be effective in the treatment of Crohn's disease according to phase 2 trials. We report the first case of esophageal Crohn's disease successfully treated with tofacitinib in a patient with worsening symptoms despite maintenance therapy with a tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor. CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old Caucasian woman presented with new dysphagia and had findings of esophageal Crohn's disease on endoscopy. The dosage of her current biologic therapy-adalimumab-was increased in frequency, without improvement. Our patient was started on tofacitinib and demonstrated an improvement in symptoms, with a repeat endoscopy showing resolution of the previous lesions. CONCLUSION: Esophageal Crohn's disease is likely underdiagnosed but is an important consideration in a patient with new symptoms of dysphagia and known Crohn's disease. Tofacitinib, while a novel agent, could have a role in the treatment of esophageal Crohn's disease that does not improve with intensification of the current biologic therapy. It provides a different mechanism in patients who become refractory to maintenance therapy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) may worsen the prognosis of ulcerative colitis (UC). The objectives of this study were to: (i) validate the International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) code for C. difficile; (ii) determine the risk of C. difficile infection after diagnosis of UC; (iii) evaluate the effect of C. difficile infection on the risk of colectomy; and (iv) assess the association between C. difficile and postoperative complications. METHODS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated by comparing ICD-10 codes for C. difficile with stool toxin tests. A population-based surveillance cohort of newly diagnosed UC patients living in Alberta, Canada were identified from 2003 to 2009 (n=1,754). The effect of a C. difficile infection on colectomy was modeled using competing risk survival regression after adjusting for covariates. The effect of a C. difficile infection on postoperative complications was assessed using a mixed effects logistic regression model. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the ICD-10 code for C. difficile were 82.1%, 99.4%, 88.4%, and 99.1%, respectively. The risk of C. difficile infection within 5 years of diagnosis with UC was 3.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.5-4.6%). The risk of colectomy was higher among UC patients diagnosed with C. difficile (sub-hazard ratio (sHR)=2.36; 95% CI: 1.47-3.80). C. difficile increased the risk of postoperative complications (odds ratio=4.84; 95% CI: 1.28-18.35). C. difficile was associated with mortality (sHR=2.56 times; 95% CI: 1.28-5.10). CONCLUSIONS: C. difficile diagnosis worsens the prognosis of newly diagnosed patients with UC by increasing the risk of colectomy, postoperative complications, and death.},

Malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies among IBD patients result in poor clinical outcomes such as growth failure, reduced response to pharmacotherapy, increased risk for sepsis, and mortality. The aim of this review is to highlight the consequences of malnutrition in the management of IBD and describe nutritional interventions to facilitate induction of remission as well as maintenance; we will also discuss alternative delivery methods to improve nutritional status preoperatively.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are susceptible to protein-calorie malnutrition secondary to decreased oral intake, malabsorption, and increased metabolic expenditure. In this study, we seek to assess the national frequencies of parenteral nutrition (PN) use among hospitalized patients with IBD and to determine their in-hospital outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1988-2006 to determine the frequency of PN usage among patients with UC or CD and to determine their in-hospital outcomes. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of increased inpatient mortality in this population. RESULTS: From 1988-2006, the annual incidence of PN use among hospitalized patients with CD was 4.29 per 100,000 and among those with UC was 3.80 per 100,000, with trends being relatively stable through the indexed period. The mean length of hospitalization among patients with UC receiving PN was longer compared with patients with CD. Factors predictive of an increased risk for mortality include the following: age >50 years, acute kidney injury, hospital-acquired pneumonia, Clostridium difficile colitis, prolonged postoperative ileus requiring PN use, pulmonary embolism, malnutrition, and patients with UC relative to CD. CONCLUSION: Traditionally, patients with CD are at a higher risk for developing malnutrition than patients with UC; however, there is a 2-fold higher risk for inpatient mortality and a longer length of hospitalization among patients with UC compared with those with CD. This pattern suggests that the use of PN, particularly among patients with UC, serves as a surrogate marker of higher disease acuity and severity.},

This report describes the case of a 24-year-old man with a 7-year history of recurrent, steroid-dependent UC. He received FMT via PEC once per day for 1 month in the hospital. After the remission of gastrointestinal symptoms, he was discharged from the hospital and continued FMT via PEC twice per week for 3 months at home. The frequency of stools decreased, and the characteristics of stools improved soon thereafter. Enteral nutrition was regained after 1 week, and an oral diet was begun 1 month later. Two months after the FMT end point, the patient resumed a normal diet, with formed soft stools once per day. The follow-up colonoscopy showed normal mucus membranes; then, the PEC set was removed. On the subsequent 12 months follow-up, the patient resumed orthobiosis without any gastrointestinal discomfort and returned to work. This case emphasizes that FMT via PEC can not only induce remission but also shorten the duration of hospitalization and reduce the medical costs; therefore, this approach should be considered an alternative option for patients with UC.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex, multi-factorial disease thought to arise from an inappropriate immune response to commensal bacteria in a genetically susceptible person that results in chronic, cyclical, intestinal inflammation. Dietary and environmental factors are implicated in the initiation and perpetuation of IBD; however, a singular causative agent has not been identified. As of now, the role of environmental priming or triggers in IBD onset and pathogenesis are not well understood, but these factors appear to synergize with other disease susceptibility factors. In previous work, we determined that the polysaccharide dietary additive, maltodextrin (MDX), impairs cellular anti-bacterial responses and suppresses intestinal anti-microbial defense mechanisms. In this addendum, we review potential mechanisms for dietary deregulation of intestinal homeostasis, postulate how dietary and genetic risk factors may combine to result in disease pathogenesis, and discuss these ideas in the context of recent findings related to dietary interventions for IBD.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the probability, rate and timing of reconstructive surgery after colectomy in patients with IBD in a population-based setting. METHOD: The study cohort included all patients with IBD in Sweden who underwent colectomy from 2000 to 2009. Each patient was followed from admission for colectomy to admission for reconstructive surgery, date of death, migration or 31 December 2010. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable Poisson regression models were used to describe the probability, rate and timing of reconstructive surgery. RESULTS: Out of 2818 IBD patients treated with colectomy, 61.0% were male and 78.9% had ulcerative colitis. No reconstructive surgery had been performed in 1595 (56.6%) patients by the end of follow-up. Of the remaining 1223 patients, 526 underwent primary reconstructive surgery and 697 had a secondary reconstruction following a median interval of 357 days from primary surgery in the form of colectomy. The probability of reconstructive surgery was dependent on age (55.6% and 18.1% at ages 15-29 and >/= 59 years, respectively), and the chance of reconstructive surgery was higher in hospitals that performed more than 13 colectomies for IBD per year [incidence rate ratio and 95% confidence interval 1.27 (1.09-1.49)]. CONCLUSION: Fewer than half of the patients having a colectomy for IBD underwent subsequent reconstructive surgery. Older age and low hospital volume were risk factors for no reconstructive surgery.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies describing the cumulative failure rate after reconstructive surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease have been restricted to specific hospitals, and the generalizability of these results in a population-based setting is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the cumulative failure rate and risk factors for failure after reconstructive surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The study cohort includes all patients with inflammatory bowel disease in Sweden who underwent colectomy in 2000 through 2013 who were later treated with reconstructive surgery with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis or ileorectal anastomosis. Each patient was followed from admission for reconstructive surgery until admission for failure (a diverting stoma or permanent stoma), date of death, migration or December 31, 2013. Cumulative failure distributions were obtained with the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariable Cox regression models were used to calculate the risk of failure. RESULTS: Of the 1809 patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with colectomy and reconstructive surgery, 83% had ulcerative colitis. During follow-up, 270 patients failed, and the cumulative failure rate was 4.1%, 13.2%, and 15.3% after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The risk of failure was lower after treatment with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis than with ileorectal anastomosis [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.72 (0.56-0.93)]. Gender, hospital volume, and timing of reconstruction were not significantly associated with the risk of failure. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-year cumulative failure rate in a nationwide setting was 15.3%, and hospital volume was not associated with the risk of failure.},

   abstract = {Decreases in the diversity of enteric bacterial populations are observed in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Less is known about the virome in these diseases. We show that the enteric virome is abnormal in CD and UC patients. In-depth analysis of preparations enriched for free virions in the intestine revealed that CD and UC were associated with a significant expansion of Caudovirales bacteriophages. The viromes of CD and UC patients were disease and cohort specific. Importantly, it did not appear that expansion and diversification of the enteric virome was secondary to changes in bacterial populations. These data support a model in which changes in the virome may contribute to intestinal inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis. We conclude that the virome is a candidate for contributing to, or being a biomarker for, human inflammatory bowel disease and speculate that the enteric virome may play a role in other diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Performing a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy is recommended for assessment of disease activity, excluding infection, and guiding medical treatment during ulcerative colitis (UC)-related hospitalizations. However, it is unknown whether the timing of endoscopy impacts clinical outcomes. The objective of our study was to determine the impact of timing of endoscopy on hospital outcomes in patients with UC-related hospitalizations. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (2006-2013). Adult inpatients (>/=19 years) with UC-related hospitalizations were identified using appropriate International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision, Clinical modification codes (ICD-9-CM). Hospital outcomes stratified by disease severity were compared between patients receiving early (<3 days after admission) and delayed endoscopies (between 3 and 7 days after admission). The primary clinical outcomes included mortality, frequency of large intestine surgery, length of stay (LOS), and hospital cost. Results were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Of a total of 84,359 patients with UC-related hospitalizations, 67.2% (56,657) underwent an early endoscopy and 32.8% (27,702) underwent a delayed endoscopy. Delayed endoscopy was associated with higher mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 1.76 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 2.88)), prolonged LOS (adjusted coefficient: 2.69 (95% CI: 2.61, 2.77)), and higher hospital cost (adjusted coefficient: $3,394 (95% CI: 3,234, 3,554)). In UC patients with intermediate disease severity, delayed endoscopy was associated with an increased frequency of large intestine surgery (adjusted odds ratio: 1.60 (95% CI: 1.01, 2.53)). CONCLUSIONS: In UC-related hospitalizations, the timing of endoscopic procedures impacts outcomes. Early endoscopy is associated with decreased mortality and better health-care utilization (LOS and hospital cost) compared with delayed endoscopy. In UC patients with intermediate disease severity, early endoscopy is also associated with a decreased frequency of large intestine surgery.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite dietary factors being implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), nutritional therapy, outside of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN), has not had a defined role within the treatment paradigm of pediatric IBD within IBD centers. Based on emerging data, Seattle Children's Hospital IBD Center has developed an integrated dietary program incorporating the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) into its treatment paradigm. This treatment paradigm uses the SCD as primary therapy as well as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of the SCD on clinical outcomes and laboratory studies of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed the medical records of patients with IBD on SCD. RESULTS: We analyzed 26 children on the SCD: 20 with CD and 6 with UC. Duration of the dietary therapy ranged from 3 to 48 mo. In patients with active CD (Pediatric Crohn's Disease activity index [PCDAI] >10), PCDAI dropped from 32.8 +/- 13.2 at baseline to 20.8 +/- 16.6 by 4 +/- 2 wk, and to 8.8 +/- 8.5 by 6 mo. The mean Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for patients with active UC decreased from a baseline of 28.3 +/- 10.3 to 20.0 +/- 17.3 at 4 +/- 2 wk, to 18.3 +/- 31.7 at 6 mo. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review provides evidence that the SCD can be integrated into a tertiary care center and may improve clinical and laboratory parameters for pediatric patients with nonstructuring, nonpenetrating CD as well as UC. Further prospective studies are needed to fully assess the safety and efficacy of the SCD in pediatric patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {There is a close relationship between the human host and the intestinal microbiota, which is an assortment of microorganisms, protecting the intestine against colonization by exogenous pathogens. Moreover, the intestinal microbiota play a critical role in providing nutrition and the modulation of host immune homeostasis. Recent reports indicate that some strains of intestinal bacteria are responsible for intestinal ulceration and chronic inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Understanding the interaction of the intestinal microbiota with pathogens and the human host might provide new strategies treating patients with IBD. This review focuses on the important role that the intestinal microbiota plays in maintaining innate immunity in the pathogenesis and etiology of UC and discusses new antibiotic therapies targeting the intestinal microbiota.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The clinical presentation of colonic juvenile polyps with abdominal discomfort and occult rectal bleedings make them difficult to recognize. The aim of this study was to report the clinical features of colonic juvenile polyps in children referred to colonoscopy and evaluate fecal calprotectin (FCP) as a screening biomarker for their diagnosis. METHODS: The study included a total of 266 children (range 3.1-19.0 years, median age 15.8 years) investigated with ileocolonoscopy; of whom, 239 (89%) were investigated for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). FCPs were analyzed as a marker of colonic inflammation, and levels < 50 mg/kg was considered to be negative. RESULTS: Juvenile polyps were detected in 12 (4.5%) children; the remaining 67 (25.2%) had Crohn disease, 57 (21.4%) ulcerative colitis, 5 (1.9%) unclassified IBD, 4 (1.5%) allergic colitis, bleeding source was localized in 6 (2.3%), and 115 (43.2%) had unspecific or normal findings. FCP was available in 203 (76.3%) children before colonoscopy; levels of FCP were higher in children with juvenile polyps (range 28-2287 mg/kg, median 844 mg/kg) compared with those with normal colonoscopies (range < 20-2443 mg/kg, median 130 mg/kg, P < 0.0001), but not compared with those with active IBD (range < 20-7780 mg/kg, median 962 mg/kg, P = 0.6299). FCPs were available in 9 of 12 children after polypectomy, of whom all had their FCP levels significantly reduced (range 0-281 mg/kg, median 49 mg/kg, P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Colonic juvenile polyps are frequently found in pediatric patients presenting with hematochezia and elevated FCP levels. Colonic juvenile polyps are difficult to differentiate from pediatric IBD without a colonoscopy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presentation, therapeutic management, and long-term outcome of children with very early-onset (VEO) (</= 5 years of age) inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). STUDY DESIGN: Data were obtained from an inception cohort of 1928 children with IBD enrolled in a prospective observational registry at multiple centers in North America. RESULTS: One hundred twelve children were </= 5 years of age with no child enrolled at <1 year of age. Of those, 42.9% had Crohn's disease (CD), 46.4% ulcerative colitis (UC), and 10.7% had IBD-unclassified. Among the children with CD, children 1-5 years of age had more isolated colonic disease (39.6%) compared with 6- to 10-year-olds (25.3%, P = .04), and 11- to 16-year-olds (22.3%, P < .01). The change from a presenting colon-only phenotype to ileocolonic began at 6-10 years. Children 1-5 years of age with CD had milder disease activity (45.8%) at diagnosis compared with the oldest group (28%, P = .01). Five years postdiagnosis, there was no difference in disease activity among the 3 groups. However, compared with the oldest group, a greater proportion of 1- to 5-year-olds with CD were receiving corticosteroids (P < .01) and methotrexate (P < .01), and a greater proportion of 1- to 5-year-olds with UC were receiving mesalamine (P < .0001) and thiopurine immunomodulators (P < .0002). CONCLUSIONS: Children with VEO-CD are more likely to have mild disease at diagnosis and present with a colonic phenotype with change to an ileocolonic phenotype noted at 6-10 years of age. Five years after diagnosis, children with VEO-CD and VEO-UC are more likely to have been administered corticosteroids and immunomodulators despite similar disease activity in all age groups. This may suggest development of a more aggressive disease phenotype over time.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biological agents such as anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induce remission in ulcerative colitis. There is however no consensus regarding the discontinuation of this treatment. AIM: The aim of this study is to assess whether clinical parameters and mucosal cytokine mRNAs in healed colonic mucosa can predict long-term remission in ulcerative colitis following discontinuation of infliximab (IFX) therapy. METHODS: The prospective Tromso Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Study is based on an intensified induction treatment algorithm with IFX to achieve disease remission. Following clinical and endoscopic remission, IFX treatment was discontinued, and follow-up until relapse was performed. Patients who achieved clinical and endoscopic remission following an induction course of IFX were included. Expression levels of TNF alpha (TNF), interferon gamma (IFNG), interleukin (IL) 6 (IL6), IL17A, IL23, and transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) were quantified by real-time PCR in mucosal biopsies obtained at colonoscopy. Remission was defined as Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UCDAI) below 3, and an endoscopic sub-score of 0-1. Relapse was defined as UCDAI score >3 and endoscopic sub-score >1. Mucosal cytokine transcript levels from 20 non-IBD patients with a normal colonoscopy served as control group. RESULTS: Of the 45 patients included, twenty patients (44%) had normalized levels of mucosal TNF expression at the time of mucosal healing, whereas 35 of 42 (83%) had normalized IL17A expression levels, and 31 of 36 (86%) had normalized IFNG expression levels. The median time to relapse was 8months (range 4-12). Normalization of TNF gene expression predicted 20months (1-39) relapse-free survival after withdrawal of IFX compared to 5months (3-7) in the group with elevated TNF expression. Mucosal expression levels of IL17A, IL23, IFNG, TGFB, IL6 did not predict long-term remission (>12months) CONCLUSION: Normalization of mucosal TNF predicts long-term remission after discontinuation of IFX.},

The risk of infection associated to use of probiotics is relatively low; however, there are selected groups of patients in whom they should be used with caution (as jejunum infusion).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Industrialization has been linked to the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). AIM: We investigated the association between air pollution exposure and IBD. METHODS: The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort was used to identify cases with Crohn's disease (CD) (n = 38) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 104) and controls (n = 568) from Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and the UK, matched for center, gender, age, and date of recruitment. Air pollution data were obtained from the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects. Residential exposure was assessed with land-use regression models for particulate matter with diameters of <10 mum (PM10), <2.5 mum (PM2.5), and between 2.5 and 10 mum (PMcoarse), soot (PM2.5 absorbance), nitrogen oxides, and two traffic indicators. Conditional logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Although air pollution was not significantly associated with CD or UC separately, the associations were mostly similar. Individuals with IBD were less likely to have higher exposure levels of PM2.5 and PM10, with ORs of 0.24 (95 % CI 0.07-0.81) per 5 mug/m(3) and 0.25 (95 % CI 0.08-0.78) per 10 mug/m(3), respectively. There was an inverse but nonsignificant association for PMcoarse. A higher nearby traffic load was positively associated with IBD [OR 1.60 (95 % CI 1.04-2.46) per 4,000,000 motor vehicles x m per day]. Other air pollutants were positively but not significantly associated with IBD. CONCLUSION: Exposure to air pollution was not found to be consistently associated with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dairy products may be involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease by modulating gut microbiota and immune responses, but data from epidemiological studies examining this relationship are limited. We investigated the association between prediagnostic intake of these foods and dietary calcium, and the subsequent development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In total, 401,326 participants were enrolled in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. At recruitment, consumption of total and specific dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and dietary calcium was measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. Cases developing incident CD (n = 110) or UC (n = 244) during follow-up were matched with 4 controls. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for total energy intake and smoking. RESULTS: Compared with the lowest quartile, the ORs for the highest quartile of total dairy products and dietary calcium intake were 0.61 (95% CI, 0.32-1.19, p trend = 0.19) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.28-1.42, p trend = 0.23) for CD, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.50-1.30, p trend = 0.40) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.49-1.34, p trend = 0.60) for UC, respectively. Compared with nonconsumers, individuals consuming milk had significantly reduced odds of CD (OR 0.30, 95% CI, 0.13-0.65) and nonsignificantly reduced odds of UC (OR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.49-1.47). CONCLUSIONS: Milk consumption may be associated with a decreased risk of developing CD, although a clear dose-response relationship was not established. Further studies are warranted to confirm this possible protective effect.},

   abstract = {Surgery for IBD is in constant evolution; it does not appear that the introduction of biologicals has had a major effect on the chance of a patient being operated on or not. Pouch surgery had its heydays in the 80s and 90s and has since then become less frequent, but the number of patients undergoing surgery still seem about the same from one year to the other. Likewise, there is no substantial evidence that surgery for Crohn's disease is diminishing. There have been fears that patients on biological treatment have an increased risk of postoperative complications. The issue is not completely settled but it is likely that patients on biological treatment who come to surgery are those who do not benefit from biologicals. Thus, they are compromised in that they have an ongoing inflammation, are in bad nutritional state, and might have several other known risk factors for a complicated postoperative course. These factors and perhaps not the biologicals per se is what surgeons should consider. During the recent years, we have seen several new developments in IBD surgery; the ileorectal anastomosis is being used for ulcerative colitis and laparoscopic surgery usually resulting in a shorter hospital stay, less pain, and better cosmetics. We have also seen the introduction of robotic surgery, single incision minimal invasive surgery, transanal minimal invasive surgery, and other approaches to minimize surgical trauma. Time will show which of these innovations patients will benefit from.},

Our objective was to examine the impact of prior consumption of LAM and/or FUC on pathology and inflammation following a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) challenge in pigs. Pigs (n 7/group) were assigned to one of five experimental groups for 56 d. From 49-55 d, distilled water or DSS was administered intragastrically. The experimental groups were: (1) basal diet + distilled water (control); (2) basal diet + DSS (DSS); (3) basal diet + FUC + DSS (FUC + DSS); (4) basal diet + LAM + DSS (LAM + DSS); and (5) basal diet + LAM + FUC + DSS (LAMFUC + DSS). The DSS group had decreased body-weight gain (P < 0.05) and serum xylose (P < 0.05), and increased proximal colon pathology score (P < 0.05), diarrhoeal score (P < 0.001) and colonic Enterobacteriaceae (P < 0.05) relative to the control group. The FUC + DSS (P < 0.01), LAM + DSS (P < 0.05) and LAMFUC + DSS (P < 0.05) groups had improved diarrhoeal score, and the LAMFUC + DSS (P < 0.05) group had improved body weight relative to the DSS group. The FUC + DSS group (P < 0.001), LAM + DSS group (P < 0.05) and LAMFUC + DSS group (P < 0.001) had lower IL-6 mRNA abundance relative to the DSS group. The LAM + DSS group had reduced Enterobacteriaceae in proximal colon digesta relative to the DSS group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, FUC or a combination of FUC and LAM improved body-weight loss, diarrhoeal scores and clinical variables associated with a DSS challenge in pigs, in tandem with a reduction in colonic IL-6 mRNA abundance.},

   abstract = {Most inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are classic complex disorders represented by common alleles. Here we aimed to define the genetic architecture of pediatric and adult-onset IBDs for the Polish population. A total of 1495 patients were recruited, including 761 patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 424 pediatric), 734 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; 390 pediatric), and 934 healthy controls. Allelotyping employed a pooled-DNA genome-wide association study (GWAS) and was validated by individual genotyping. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 44 IBD patients diagnosed before 6 years of age, 45 patients diagnosed after 40 years of age, and 18 healthy controls. Altogether, out of 88 selected SNPs, 31 SNPs were replicated for association with IBD. A novel BRD2 (rs1049526) association reached significance of P = 5.2 x 10-11 and odds ratio (OR) = 2.43. Twenty SNPs were shared between pediatric and adult patients; 1 and 7 were unique to adult-onset and pediatric-onset IBD, respectively. WES identified numerous rare and potentially deleterious variants in IBD-associated or innate immunity-associated genes. Deleterious alleles in both groups were over-represented among rare variants in affected children. Our GWAS revealed differences in the polygenic architecture of pediatric- and adult-onset IBD. A significant accumulation of rare and deleterious variants in affected children suggests a contribution by yet unexplained genetic components.},

   abstract = {There is increasing scientific interest in the field of vitamin D research, moving the focus beyond bone health to other disease processes. Low circulating vitamin D levels have been reported as a risk factor for several pathophysiologically divergent diseases, including cancers, diabetes, CVD, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But, therein, remains the challenge: can any single nutrient contribute to multiple complex disease mechanisms and, ultimately, have therapeutic potential? The aim of this review is to critically evaluate several strands of scientific evidence surrounding vitamin D and inflammation, primarily focusing on IBD. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased incidence of IBD and rheumatoid arthritis in countries of more northern latitudes, mirroring sunlight patterns. A considerable body of evidence supports the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, at least in animal models of IBD. Although it is accepted that suboptimal vitamin D status is common in IBD, some studies suggest that this associates with more severe disease. With regard to treatment, the data are only beginning to emerge from randomised controlled trials to suggest that people with IBD may remain in remission longer when treated with oral vitamin D. In conclusion, several strands of evidence suggest that vitamin D may modify the immune response in IBD. There is a continued need for large well-designed clinical trials and mechanistic studies to determine if, and how, this emerging promise translates into tangible clinical benefits for people with chronic debilitating diseases such as IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by wasting and chronic intestinal inflammation triggered by various cytokine-mediated pathways. In recent years, it was shown that T helper 17 (Th17) cells are involved in the pathogenesis of IBD, which makes them an attractive therapeutic target. Th17 cells preferentially produce interleukin (IL)-17A-F as signature cytokines. The role of the interplay between host genetics and intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD was demonstrated. Probiotics are live microorganisms that when orally ingested in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host by modulating the enteric flora or by stimulating the local immune system. Several studies indicated the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing and treating IBD (ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease). Furthermore, there is mounting evidence of probiotics selectively targeting the Th17 lineage in the prevention and management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as IBD. This review highlights critical roles of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of IBD and the rationale for using probiotics as a novel therapeutic approach for IBD through manipulation of Th17 cells. The potential molecular mechanisms by which probiotics modulate Th17 cells differentiation and production are also discussed.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development is affected by complex interactions between environmental factors, changes in intestinal flora, various predisposing genetic properties and changes in the immune system. Dietary factors seem to play an underestimated role in the etiopathogenesis and course of the disease. However, research about food and IBD is conflicting. An excessive consumption of sugar, animal fat and linoleic acid is considered a risk factor for IBD development, whereas a high fiber diet and citrus fruit consumption may play a protective role. Also, appropriate nutrition in particular periods of the disease may facilitate achieving or prolonging remissions and most of all, improve the quality of life for patients. During disease exacerbation, a low fiber diet is recommended for most patients. In the remission time, an excessive consumption of alcohol and sulfur products may have a negative effect on the disease course. Attempts are also made at employing diets composed in detail in order to supplement IBD therapy. A diet with a modified carbohydrate composition, a semi-vegetarian diet and a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols are under investigation. Due to chronic inflammation as well as side effects of chronically used medications, patients with IBD are also at increased risk of nutritional factor deficiencies, including iron, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, folic acid, zinc, magnesium and vitamin A. It should also be remembered that there is no single common diet suitable for all IBD patients; each of them is unique and dietary recommendations must be individually developed for each patient, depending on the course of the disease, past surgical procedures and type of pharmacotherapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The literature on interaction between pregnancy and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is inconsistent, and there are no reports on this aspect from Asia. This study evaluated the impact both IBD and pregnancy have on each other in a large cohort of Indian patients. METHODS: In total, 514 females with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) aged between 18 and 45 years attending IBD clinic, at our institute, from July 2004 to July 2013 were screened, and patients with data on pregnancy status were included (n = 406). Pregnancies were categorized as either before, after or coinciding with disease onset. Long-term disease course was ascertained from prospectively maintained records. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes were recorded from antenatal records or individual interviews. RESULTS: Of 406 patients (UC: 336, CD: 70), 310 became pregnant (UC: 256, CD: 54), with a total of 597 pregnancies (UC: 524, CD: 73). More UC patients with pregnancies were in long-term remission than non-pregnant patients (56.7 vs. 43.4 %, p = 0.04). Long-term remission was less frequent in UC patients in whom pregnancy coincided with disease onset than patients with pregnancies before and after/pregnancy after the disease onset (41.4 vs. 62.5 %, p = 0.023). Pregnancies after the disease onset were associated with more cesarean sections and adverse fetal outcomes than pregnancies before disease onset in both UC and CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term disease course in UC patients was better in pregnant as compared to non-pregnant patients. Among pregnant UC patients, disease course was worst when pregnancy coincided with disease onset. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes were worse in pregnancy after disease onset than pregnancy before disease onset.},

   abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that abnormal levels of homocysteine are associated with vascular dysfunctions, cancer cell proliferation and various neurodegenerative diseases. With respect to the latter, a perturbation of transition metal homeostasis and an inhibition of catalase bioactivity have been reported. Herein, we report on some of the molecular bases for the cellular toxicity of homocysteine and demonstrate that it induces the formation of sulfcatalase, an irreversible inactive state of the enzyme, without the intervention of hydrogen sulfide. Initially, homocysteine reacts with native catalase and/or redox-active transition metal ions to generate thiyl radicals that mediate compound II formation, a temporarily inactive state of the enzyme. Then, the ferryl centre of compound II intervenes into the unprecedented S-oxygenation of homocysteine to engender the corresponding sulfenic acid species that further participates into the prosthetic heme modification through the formation of an unusual Fe(II) sulfonium. In addition, our ex cellulo studies performed on cancer cells, models of neurodegenerative diseases and ulcerative colitis suggest the likelihood of this scenario in a subset of cancer cells, as well as in a cellular model of Parkinson's disease. Our findings expand the repertoire of heme modifications promoted by biological compounds and point out another deleterious trait of disturbed homocysteine levels that could participate in the aetiology of these diseases.},

   abstract = {High-throughput technologies revealed new categories of genes, including the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), involved in the pathogenesis of human disease; however, the role of lncRNAs in the ulcerative colitis (UC) has not been evaluated. Gene expression profiling was used to develop lncRNA signatures in UC samples. Jurkat T cells were activated by PMA/ionomycin subsequently interferon-gamma (IFNG) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha protein levels were assessed by ELISA. Anti-sense molecules were designed to block IFNG-AS1 expression. A unique set of lncRNAs was differentially expressed between UC and control samples. Of these, IFNG-AS1 was among the highest statistically significant lncRNAs (fold change: 5.27, P value: 7.07E-06). Bioinformatic analysis showed that IFNG-AS1 was associated with the IBD susceptibility loci SNP rs7134599 and its genomic location is adjacent to the inflammatory cytokine IFNG. In mouse models of colitis, active colitis samples had increased colonic expression of this lncRNA. Utilizing the Jurkat T cell model, we found IFNG-AS1 to positively regulate IFNG expression. Novel lncRNA signatures differentiate UC patients with active disease, patients in remission, and control subjects. A subset of these lncRNAs was found to be associated with the clinically validated IBD susceptibility loci. IFNG-AS1 was one of these differentially expressed lncRNAs in UC patients and found to regulate the key inflammatory cytokine, IFNG, in CD4 T cells. Taking these findings together, our study revealed novel lncRNA signatures deregulated in UC and identified IFNG-AS1 as a novel regulator of IFNG inflammatory responses, suggesting the potential importance of noncoding RNA mechanisms on regulation of inflammatory bowel disease-related inflammatory responses.},

IBD can be generally classified into either ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) that differs in the clinical and histopathology. The role of neuropeptides in the pathogenesis of these conditions is becoming increasingly recognized for their importance in modulating the inflammatory state. Animal models provide the greatest insight to better understand the pathophysiology of both disorders which will hopefully allow for improved treatment strategies. This review will provide a better understanding of the role of murine models for studying colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary fiber intake leading to short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production could be a strategy to combat intermittent bouts of inflammation during ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate dietary potato fiber (PF) in attenuating inflammation using a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. We hypothesized that PF would show anti-inflammatory effects compared with cellulose due in part to SCFA production. METHODS: Male C57Bl/6J mice were fed diets containing either 8% cellulose or 14.5% PF for a 22-d feeding study. Starting on study day 14, mice were provided either distilled water (control) or 2% (wt:vol) DSS in drinking water for 5 d (cellulose+control, n = 17; PF+control, n = 16; cellulose+DSS, n = 17; and PF+DSS, n = 16). Body weights and food and water intakes were collected daily from day 14 through day 22. Distal colon tissue was analyzed for histologic outcomes and changes in gene expression, and cecal contents were analyzed for SCFA concentrations. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, with repeated measures applied where necessary. RESULTS: At day 5 post-DSS induction, cellulose+DSS mice exhibited a 2% reduction (P < 0.05) in body weight compared with PF+DSS and PF+ and cellulose+control mice. PF+DSS mice had greater (P < 0.05) cecal butyrate concentrations [24.5 mumol/g dry matter (DM)] than did cellulose+DSS mice (4.93 mumol/g DM). Mice fed PF+DSS had lower (P < 0.05) infiltration of leukocytes in the distal colon than did mice fed cellulose+DSS (mean histology scores of 1.22 and 2.30, respectively). Furthermore, mice fed cellulose+DSS exhibited 1.42, 11.5, 8.48, and 35.5 times greater (P < 0.05) colon mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnfa) and interleukin (Il) 1b, Il6, and Il17a, respectively, and 7.10 times greater (P < 0.05) expression of C-X-C motif ligand 1 (Cxc1) compared with mice fed PF+DSS. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PF fed to mice before and during DSS colitis attenuates inflammation, potentially through SCFA production; however, future studies are needed to understand the role of dietary fiber intake and immune activation.},

DSS-induced mice presented reduced body weight, which was improved by allicin administration. We noted increases in CD68 expression, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities, and Malonaldehyde (MDA) and mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) alpha, interleukin- (IL-) 1beta, IL-6, and IL-17, and decrease in the activities of enzymic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione reductase (GR), and Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in DSS-induced mice. However, allicin treatment significantly decreased CD68, MPO, MDA, and proinflammatory cytokines and increased the enzymic antioxidants significantly (P < 0.05). In addition, allicin was capable of reducing the activation and nuclear accumulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), thereby preventing degradation of the inhibitory protein IkappaB and inducing inhibition of the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-p65 in the colonic mucosa. These findings suggest that allicin exerts clinically useful anti-inflammatory effects mediated through the suppression of the NF-kappaB and IL-6/p-STAT3(Y705) pathways.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) encompass at least two forms of intestinal inflammation: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). Both conditions are chronic and inflammatory disorders in the gastrointestinal tract, with an increasing prevalence being associated with the industrialization of nations and in developing countries. Patients with these disorders are 10 to 20 times more likely to develop cancer of the colon. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of a naturally occurring polyphenol, gallic acid (GA), in an experimental murine model of UC. A significant blunting of weight loss and clinical symptoms was observed in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-exposed, GA-treated mice compared with control mice. This effect was associated with a remarkable amelioration of the disruption of the colonic architecture, a significant reduction in colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and a decrease in the expression of inflammatory mediators, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, GA reduced the activation and nuclear accumulation of p-STAT3(Y705), preventing the degradation of the inhibitory protein IkappaB and inhibiting of the nuclear translocation of p65-NF-kappaB in colonic mucosa. These findings suggest that GA exerts potentially clinically useful anti-inflammatory effects mediated through the suppression of p65-NF-kappaB and IL-6/p-STAT3(Y705) activation.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a nonspecific inflammatory disorder characterized by oxidative and nitrosative stress, leucocyte infiltration, and upregulation of inflammatory mediators. Boldine is an alkaloid compound found in Boldo tree, with multiple pharmacological actions, mainly anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, and immunomodulatory activities. Hence, the effect of boldine for its anti-inflammatory properties against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in BALB/c mice was studied. Administration of boldine to DSS-induced mice protects colon damage by reduced disease activity index, spleen weight, and increased colon length. Also administration of boldine showed a reduction in the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD 68+ expression. Boldine reduced the colon damage, with significant reductions in both the extent and the severity of the inflammation as well as in crypt damage and leukocyte infiltration in the mucosa. Analysis in vivo showed clear decrease in the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-(p-STAT3)(Y705) with nuclear factor (p65-NF-kappaB) production being reduced significantly. Moreover, p65-NF-kappaB activation was reduced in mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells in vitro. The data demonstrated that boldine may be beneficial in colitis through selective immunomodulatory effects, which may be mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of p65-NF-kappaB and STAT3 signaling pathways.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Early appendectomy is inversely associated with the development of UC. However, the impact of appendectomy on the clinical course of UC is controversial, generally favouring a milder disease course. We aim to describe the effect appendectomy has on the disease course of UC with focus on the timing of appendectomy in relation to UC diagnosis. DESIGN: Using the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium database of patients with UC, the risk of colectomy was compared between patients who did and did not undergo appendectomy. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis of studies that examined the association between appendectomy and colectomy. RESULTS: 2980 patients with UC were initially included. 111 (4.4%) patients with UC had an appendectomy; of which 63 were performed prior to UC diagnosis and 48 after diagnosis. In multivariable analysis, appendectomy performed at any time was an independent risk factor for colectomy (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.1), with appendectomy performed after UC diagnosis most strongly associated with colectomy (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.5). An updated meta-analysis showed appendectomy performed either prior to or after UC diagnosis had no effect on colectomy rates. CONCLUSIONS: Appendectomy performed at any time in relation to UC diagnosis was not associated with a decrease in severity of disease. In fact, appendectomy after UC diagnosis may be associated with a higher risk of colectomy. These findings question the proposed use of appendectomy as treatment for UC.},

METHODS: 832 sera were studied, including 617 consecutive IBD patients from 323 CrD and 294 ulcerative colitis (UC) follow-up in a tertiary centre, and 112 pathological and 103 normal controls. RESULTS: Sensitivity of IgA anti-MZGP2 for CrD in the IBD population was 15% and specificity was 98% (95, 99), while the sensitivity and specificity of IgG anti-MZGP2 were 27% and 97%. IgA and IgG anti-MZGP2 combined testing led to a sensitivity of 31% and a specificity of 96%. Positivity for either ASCA (IgA or IgG) or anti-MZGP2 (IgA or IgG) showed a sensitivity of 75% (70, 80) and a specificity of 84% (79, 89). IgA anti-MZGP2 antibodies were more prevalent in CrD patients with early disease onset (p=0.011). Also, anti-MZGP2 positive patients more frequently had extensive disease with ileal involvement. Patients with longer disease duration were more likely to have IgG anti-MZGP2 antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel ELISA confirms the high specificity of anti-MZGP2 antibodies for CrD and their association with disease severity phenotypes.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an inflammatory disorder caused by hyperactivation of effector immune cells that produce high levels of proinflammatory cytokines. The aims of our study were to determine whether orally administered blueberry extract (BE) could attenuate or prevent the development of experimental colitis in mice and to elucidate the mechanism of action. Female Balb/C mice (n=7) were randomized into groups differing in treatment conditions (prevention and treatment) and dose of BE (50 mg/kg body weight). Acute ulcerative colitis was induced by oral administration of 3% dextran sodium sulfate for 7 days in drinking water. Colonic mucosal injury was assessed by clinical, macroscopic, biochemical and histopathological examinations. BE significantly decreased disease activity index and improved the macroscopic and histological score of colons when compared to the colitis group (P<.05). BE markedly attenuated myeloperoxidase accumulation (colitis group 54.97+/-2.78 nmol/mg, treatment group 30.78+/-1.33 nmol/mg) and malondialdehyde in colon and prostaglandin E2 level in serum while increasing the levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase (colitis group 11.94+/-1.16 U/ml, BE treatment group 16.49+/-0.39 U/ml) compared with the colitis group (P<.05). mRNA levels of the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-1beta and inducible nitric oxide synthase cytokines were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that BE attenuates the expression of COX-2 and IL-1beta in colonic tissue. Moreover, BE reduced the nuclear translocation of nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) by immunofluorescence analysis. Thus, the anti-inflammatory effect of BE at colorectal sites is a result of a number of mechanisms: antioxidation, down-regulation of the expression of inflammatory mediators and inhibition of the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of multifactorial etiology that primarily affects the colonic mucosa. The disease progresses over time, and clinical management guidelines should reflect its dynamic nature. There is limited evidence supporting UC management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach. AIM: To use a formal consensus method - the nominal group technique (NGT) - to develop a clinical practice expert opinion to outline simple algorithms and practices, optimize UC management, and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions. METHODS: The consensus was developed by an expert panel of 37 gastroenterologists from various professional organizations with experience in UC management using the qualitative and iterative NGT, incorporating deliberations based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommendations, recent reviews of scientific literature, and pertinent discussion topics developed by a steering committee. Examples of clinical cases for which there are limited evidence-based data from clinical trials were used. Two working groups proposed and voted on treatment algorithms that were then discussed and voted for by the nominal group as a whole, in order to reach a consensus. RESULTS: A clinical practice guideline covering management of the following clinical situations was developed: (i) moderate and severe UC; (ii) acute severe UC; (iii) pouchitis; (iv) refractory proctitis, in the form of treatment algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: Given the limited available evidence-based data, a formal consensus methodology was used to develop simple treatment guidelines for UC management in different clinical situations that is now accessible via an online application.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE) program was initiated by the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IOIBD). It examined potential treatment targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to be used for a "treat-to-target" clinical management strategy using an evidence-based expert consensus process. METHODS: A Steering Committee of 28 IBD specialists developed recommendations based on a systematic literature review and expert opinion. Consensus was gained if >/=75% of participants scored the recommendation as 7-10 on a 10-point rating scale (where 10=agree completely). RESULTS: The group agreed upon 12 recommendations for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The agreed target for UC was clinical/patient-reported outcome (PRO) remission (defined as resolution of rectal bleeding and diarrhea/altered bowel habit) and endoscopic remission (defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0-1). Histological remission was considered as an adjunctive goal. Clinical/PRO remission was also agreed upon as a target for CD and defined as resolution of abdominal pain and diarrhea/altered bowel habit; and endoscopic remission, defined as resolution of ulceration at ileocolonoscopy, or resolution of findings of inflammation on cross-sectional imaging in patients who cannot be adequately assessed with ileocolonoscopy. Biomarker remission (normal C-reactive protein (CRP) and calprotectin) was considered as an adjunctive target. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence- and consensus-based recommendations for selecting the goals for treat-to-target strategies in patients with IBD are made available. Prospective studies are needed to determine how these targets will change disease course and patients' quality of life.},

   abstract = {The immune response is a very complex interplay of specific and nonspecific branches that have evolved to distinguish between nondangerous and dangerous or nontolerated factors. In the past, research has focused on the specific immune system much more than the host's innate defense. Studies have shown that a key component of the immune response involves activation of the inflammasome. A direct relationship between the presence of the inflammasome and the onset of disease has already been characterized for a variety of chronic and food-related diseases, including arthrosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, and chronic bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The leukocyte activation (ALCAT test), an immunological blood test for food intolerance reactions, is ideal to identify and eliminate individual food stimuli that may act as triggers for the cellular nonspecific immune response. Although the test is not diagnostic, studies have established that it can be a useful screening tool for the identification of foreign substances that may trigger immune cell activation, particularly of neutrophils, leading to inflammatory disorders. The ALCAT test, coupled with a targeted diet that is individually tailored according to the test's results, may support immune homeostasis and provide a valuable complementary approach for therapy and overall health.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic-assisted ileostomy (LAI) represents a cornerstone for the staged approach to ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim is to determine stoma morbidity in a series of pediatric patients and possibly identify specific risk factors. METHODS: All of the patients who underwent LAI for UC between January 2008 and December 2014 were included. The following data were collected: patient demographics, preoperative medical treatment, body mass index (BMI) at surgery, Pediatric UC Index (PUCAI), and stoma-related complications. In this series of patients, a staged approach has been adopted (subtotal colectomy + ileostomy; restorative proctocolectomy with J-pouch ileo-rectal anastomosis + ileostomy; ileostomy closure). RESULTS: Seventy-two LAIs were fashioned in 37 pediatric patients with UC. Median age at surgery was 12 years (range 5-14.8 years). Boy to girl ratio was 0.85:1. Mortality was zero. Complications occurred after 8 procedures after a median of 31 days postoperatively (range 8-60 days). Those were significantly more frequent in the case of BMI-z score >-0.51 (deleted in revised manuscript, ie, relatively overweight patients) and in the case of preoperative azathioprine administration. Pediatric UC Index score, sex, number of preoperative medications, and other preoperative parameters did not correlate with the incidence of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests to keep a prudent behavior in the case of patients with a BMI-z score >-0.51 and received preoperative azathioprine administration. Parents should be adequately acknowledged on this regard.},

   abstract = {The aetiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which are primarily Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, still remains unclear, while the incidence of IBD is constantly increasing, especially in the industrialised countries. Among genetic, environmental, and immunological factors, changes in the composition of the intestinal microflora and diet are indicated as very important in initiating and sustaining inflammation in patients with IBD. Above all nutrients dietary fibre is an especially important component of diet in the context of IBD. A potentially protective effect of high-fibre diet on intestinal disorders was described as early as in 1973. Several trials performed in animal models of IBD and human studies have reported that supplementation of some types of dietary fibre can prolong remission and reduce lesions of the intestinal mucosa during the course of the disease. This paper presents the current state of knowledge on the effects of dietary fibre in IBD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Determination of overweight and obesity prevalence in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at the time of diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective study. The study group consisted of children with new cases of IBD diagnosed in 2005-2013 according to the Porto criteria. Hospital admission records were reviewed for demographic and clinical characteristics. BMI-for-age and gender percentile charts were used to define overweight as >/=85th BMI percentile and obesity as >/=95th BMI percentile. RESULTS: 675 patients were evaluated: 368 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 307 with ulcerative colitis (UC). Of these, 54.8% were boys and 45.2% were girls. There were no statistically significant differences in age, weight, height and disease activity between the CD and UC patients. The UC patients had higher BMI values than the CD patients. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was higher in the UC than the CD patients (4.89% CI95 2.76-7.93 vs. 2.45% CI95 1.12-4.59 and 8.47% CI95 5.61-12.16 vs. 1.9% CI95 0.77-3.88, respectively); the differences were statistically significant (-2.44% CI95 -5.45 to 0.49 and -6.57% CI95 -10 to -3.1, respectively). The risk of overweight/obesity was 3.5 times higher for patients with UC (OR=0.272, CI95 0.14-0.49, p=0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of overweight and obesity in newly diagnosed children with IBD was 8.4% and was higher in patients with UC than in patients with CD. The results of this study have shown that not only malnourished children may suffer from IBD but also children who are overweight or obese at the time of diagnosis.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) constitutes a growing public health concern in western countries. Bacteria with anti-inflammatory properties are lacking in the dysbiosis accompanying IBD. Selected strains of probiotic bacteria with anti-inflammatory properties accordingly alleviate symptoms and enhance treatment of ulcerative colitis in clinical trials. Such properties are also found in selected strains of dairy starters such as Propionibacterium freudenreichii and Lactobacillus delbrueckii (Ld). We thus investigated the possibility to develop a fermented dairy product, combining both starter and probiotic abilities of both lactic acid and propionic acid bacteria, designed to extend remissions in IBD patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a single-strain Ld-fermented milk and a two-strain P. freudenreichii and Ld-fermented experimental pressed cheese using strains previously selected for their anti-inflammatory properties. Consumption of these experimental fermented dairy products protected mice against trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid induced colitis, alleviating severity of symptoms, modulating local and systemic inflammation, as well as colonic oxidative stress and epithelial cell damages. As a control, the corresponding sterile dairy matrix failed to afford such protection. CONCLUSION: This work reveals the probiotic potential of this bacterial mixture, in the context of fermented dairy products. It opens new perspectives for the reverse engineering development of anti-inflammatory fermented foods designed for target populations with IBD, and has provided evidences leading to an ongoing pilot clinical study in ulcerative colitis patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional implications of IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often develop elevated liver enzymes (ELE), which are frequently a benign, transient finding, but may be related to treatment or IBD-associated liver diseases. Distinguishing benign from pathologic ELE is crucial for focused diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. We sought to characterize the incidence, character, chronicity, degree, and etiology of ELE in children with IBD. METHODS: Institutional review board-approved retrospective review of all of the patients with IBD (2-21 years) seen between October 2009 and October 2012 with >9 months of follow-up were included in the study. We examined body mass index, disease activity, extent, phenotype, concurrent medications, and character, chronicity, degree of enzyme elevation, and final diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 219 of 514 patients with IBD had >/=1 episode of ELE. Five patients were excluded for preexisting liver disease, leaving 214 patients (Crohn disease [CD]: 14.8 +/- 3.5 years, 46% girls; ulcerative colitis [UC]: 14.4 +/- 4.2 years, 37% girls). One hundred forty-eight patients (69%) had a hepatic, 17 (8%) cholestatic, and 49 (23%) mixed character of ELE. There were no significant differences in character, chronicity, or degree of ELE between CD and UC (P = 0.71, P = 0.58, P > 0.33). Of the 128 patients with sufficient data to determine chronicity, 98 (77%) had transient elevations, (CD: n = 66, 75% and UC: n = 32, 80%). Episodes of ELE were idiopathic in 87% of patients with IBD. A final diagnosis of idiopathic ELE was associated with a lower degree of ELE elevation (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with IBD commonly experience transient, idiopathic ELE. Our findings suggest that higher degrees of ELE, specifically alanine aminotransferase, are associated with an etiology that requires more extensive evaluation.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammation increases colorectal cancer (CRC) risk as seen in ulcerative colitis (UC). Proinflammatory cytokines play a critical role in mediating the development of colitis associated cancer (CAC). In this study, the therapeutic efficacy of anti-interleukin (IL)-17A by anti-IL-17A antibody injection on the development of CAC was assessed in 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) plus dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced CAC mouse model. The results showed that mice dosed with DMH plus DSS for 10 weeks evoked high degree dysplastic lesion in the large bowel that accompanied with significant increased IL-17A expression, proliferation index and inflammation degree in mice. After anti-IL-17A antibody injection for 2 weeks, the number of tumors, proliferation index and the expression level of IL-17A protein in the large bowel tissues were significantly decreased. Therefore, we concluded that the anti-IL-17A blockade can suppress the development of CAC and is a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention of CAC in colitis mice.},

Western diet is a risk factor for the development of IBD, but it may have different effects on gut microbiota between IBD and non-IBD individuals. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) can induce remission in pediatric Crohn's disease with a decrease in gut microbial diversity. Although there are some theoretical benefits, actual treatment effects of prebiotics and probiotics in IBD vary. High-quality studies have shown that VSL#3 (a high-potency probiotic medical food containing eight different strains) exhibits benefits in treating ulcerative colitis, and gut microbial diversity is reduced after treated with VSL#3 in animal models. The effect of fecal microbiome transplantation on IBD is controversial. Increasing microbial diversity compared with impaired handling of bacteria presents a dilemma. Antibiotics are the strongest factors in the reduction of microbiome ecological diversity. Some antibiotics may help to induce remission of the disease. Microbiome alteration has been suggested to be an intrinsic property of IBD and a potential predictor in diagnosis and prognosis. However, the effects of therapeutic modulations are variable; thus, more questions remain to be answered.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Specific nutrients or foods have been inconsistently associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) risks. Thus, we investigated associations between diet as a whole, as dietary patterns, and UC and CD risks. METHODS: Within the prospective EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer) study, we set up a nested matched case-control study among 366,351 participants with inflammatory bowel disease data, including 256 incident cases of UC and 117 of CD, and 4 matched controls per case. Dietary intake was recorded at baseline from validated food frequency questionnaires. Incidence rate ratios of developing UC and CD were calculated for quintiles of the Mediterranean diet score and a posteriori dietary patterns produced by factor analysis. RESULTS: No dietary pattern was associated with either UC or CD risks. However, when excluding cases occurring within the first 2 years after dietary assessment, there was a positive association between a "high sugar and soft drinks" pattern and UC risk (incidence rate ratios for the fifth versus first quintile, 1.68 [1.00-2.82]; Ptrend = 0.02). When considering the foods most associated with the pattern, high consumers of sugar and soft drinks were at higher UC risk only if they had low vegetables intakes. CONCLUSIONS: A diet imbalance with high consumption of sugar and soft drinks and low consumption of vegetables was associated with UC risk. Further studies are needed to investigate whether microbiota alterations or other mechanisms mediate this association.},

With growing attention to coordinated healthcare for patients with chronic systemic diseases, this review focuses on the care of IBD patients in remission, their concerns, quality of life, follow-up, the role of primary care physicians and the IBD-specific aspects of long-term care. We did an extensive PubMed search for articles pertaining to IBD patients in remission and, along with the authors' experience, formulated a comprehensive review. The difficulties faced by IBD patients in remission include but are not limited to education and employment concerns, psychosocial issues, problems related to health insurance, nutrition, fertility and infections. This review also addresses newer treatment modalities, the debatable effects of smoking on IBD and the importance of vaccination. IBD in remission can be a challenge due to its multifaceted nature; however, with a coordinated approach by gastroenterologists and other involved practitioners, several of these issues can be addressed.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The role of dietary fatty acids in ulcerative colitis (UC) pathogenesis has been shown in animal models; however, human studies are rare. We hypothesized that there might be a relationship between dietary fatty acid composition and the risk of developing incident UC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Overall, 62 new cases of UC and 124 healthy age and sex-matched controls were studied. Information on usual diet was measured by a validated country-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounding variables was carried out to compare dietary fatty acid intakes between cases and controls. RESULTS: We found positive associations between dietary intake of total fat (P value for trend <0.01), oleic acid (P value for trend <0.01), saturated fatty acid (SAFA) (P value for trend = 0.02), total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (P value for trend = 0.04), and trans fat (P value for trend <0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that higher consumptions of total fats, oleic acid, SAFAs, total PUFAs, trans fat, MUFAs, and linoleic acid are significantly associated with increased risk for UC; however, no statistically significant associations were detected between the risk of disease and n-3 PUFAs and cholesterol intake.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is rising in populations with western-style diet, rich in fat and protein, and low in fruits and vegetables. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the association between dietary protein intakes and the risk of developing incident UC. METHODS: Sixty two cases of UC and 124 controls were studied using country-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Group comparisons by each factor were done using chi2 test, and significance level was set at alpha= 0.05. Logistic regression adjusted for potential confounding variables was carried out. RESULTS: Univariate analysis suggested positive associations between processed meat, red meat and organ meat with risk of ulcerative colitis. Comparing highest versus lowest categories of consumption, multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis accounting for potential confounding variables indicated that patients who consumed a higher amount of processed meat were at a higher risk for developing UC (P value for trend= 0.02). Similarly, patients who consumed higher amounts of red meat were at a higher risk for UC (P value for trend= 0.01). The highest tertile of intake of organ meat was associated with an increased risk of ulcerative colitis with a statistically significant trend across tertiles (P value for trend= 0.01) when adjusted. CONCLUSION: In this case-control study we observed that higher consumptions of processed meat, red meat and organ meat were associated with increased risk for UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The imbalance of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the maternal diet impairs intestinal barrier development and sensitizes the colon response to inflammatory insults in the young rats. With a view to overcoming this issue, we designed this study to investigate the effect of maternal and neonatal intake of different proportions of n-6/n-3 fatty acids on colon inflammation in the young adult rats. METHODS: Female Wistar rats were assigned into four groups, and each group fed one of four semisynthetic diets, namely n-6, low n-3, n-6/n-3 and n-3 fatty acids for 8 weeks prior to mating, during gestation and lactation periods. At weaning, the pups were separated from the dams and fed diet similar to the mothers. Colitis was induced on postnatal day 35, by administering 2 % dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water for 10 days. Colitis was assessed based on the clinical and inflammatory markers in the colon. Fatty acid analysis was done in liver, RBC, colon and spleen. RESULTS: A balanced n-6/n-3 PUFA diet significantly improved the body weight loss, rectal bleeding and mortality in rats. This was associated with lower myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, TNF-alpha and IL-6, IL-8, COX-2 and iNOS levels in the colon tissues. Fatty acid analysis has shown that the arachidonic acid/docosahexaenoic acid ratio was significantly lower in liver, RBC, colon and spleen in n-6/n-3 and n-3 diet groups. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that balanced n-6/n-3 PUFA supplementation in maternal and neonatal diet alters systemic AA/DHA ratio and attenuates colon inflammation in the young adult rats.},

   abstract = {Our recent study has demonstrated that medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and monounsaturated fatty acids potentiate the beneficial effects of fish oil on risk factors of cardiovascular disease. In the present study, we have investigated the influence of MCT or olive oil on the protective and mucosal healing ability of fish oil in ulcerative colitis using cell simulation and animal models. Caco-2 cells grown in medium chain fatty acids enriched medium has exaggerated t-butyl hydroperoxide induced cell damage, GSH depletion, and IL-1beta induced IL-8 synthesis, compared to the cells grown in oleic acid & hydroxytyrosol (OT) enriched medium. Further, combined treatment of cells with eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and OT has remarkably attenuated the cell damage, and IL-8 synthesis, compared to individual treatments. To evaluate the effect of these lipid formulations in vivo, adult Wistar rats were fed diet enriched with high amount of medium chain triglycerides (MCT), virgin olive oil, or their combination with fish oil. Colitis was induced in rats using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7days followed by 10-days of recovery period. Rats of MCT group exhibit severe disease activity, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in the colon compared to the olive oil group. Furthermore, there was persistent body weight loss, loose stools, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in the rats of MCT group, even after DSS was withdrawn from drinking water. Conversely, fish oil has remarkably attenuated the DSS induced alterations in both MCT and olive oil diet groups with significantly greater effect in the olive oil group. Thus, MCT increase the susceptibility to colitis through oxidative damage and IL-8 synthesis in intestinal epithelial cells. The beneficial effects of virgin olive oil could be partially attributed to hydroxytyrosol. Combined treatment of hydroxytyrosol, oleic acid and n-3 fatty acids exhibit huge therapeutic benefits in colitis.},

Just a decade ago, intestinal strictures were considered to be an inevitable consequence of long-term inflammation in patients who did not respond to anti-inflammatory therapies. Inflammatory bowel diseases-associated fibrosis was seen as an irreversible process that frequently led to intestinal obstructions requiring surgical intervention. This paradigm has changed rapidly, due to the antifibrotic approaches that may become available. We review the mechanisms and diagnosis of this serious complication of inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as factors that predict its progression and management strategies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The accuracy of available noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification, and prediction of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) courses is limited. We analyzed volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the breath of IBD patients and controls for diagnosis and differentiation of IBD as well as their link with disease location, activity, and phenotype. METHODS: A prospective study of diagnostic testing was conducted, recruiting Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), other inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases (OGDs), and healthy controls (HCs), as well as subjects with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). The breath VOC profile was analyzed using selective ion flow tube-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-four subjects (n=24 CD, n=11 UC, n=6 OGD, n=53 HC, n=30 IPAA) were included. The breath metabolome was significantly different in patients with IBD, CD, or UC compared with OGD and HC (7 out of 22 VOCs), but not between CD and UC. No link between the level of VOCs with complications, disease location, and clinical or radiologic disease activity, as well as lab parameters or type of medication was found. Breath VOCs were markedly different in patients with IPAA compared with any other group (17 out of 22 VOCs) and the presence of pouch inflammation did not alter the VOC levels. CONCLUSIONS: A specific breath metabolome is associated with IBD and markedly changes in patients with IPAA. Analysis of a broader spectrum of VOCs can potentially aid in the development of breath prints to diagnose or differentiate inflammatory bowel disorders.},

   abstract = {Protein-truncating variants protective against human disease provide in vivo validation of therapeutic targets. Here we used targeted sequencing to conduct a search for protein-truncating variants conferring protection against inflammatory bowel disease exploiting knowledge of common variants associated with the same disease. Through replication genotyping and imputation we found that a predicted protein-truncating variant (rs36095412, p.R179X, genotyped in 11,148 ulcerative colitis patients and 295,446 controls, MAF=up to 0.78%) in RNF186, a single-exon ring finger E3 ligase with strong colonic expression, protects against ulcerative colitis (overall P=6.89 x 10(-7), odds ratio=0.30). We further demonstrate that the truncated protein exhibits reduced expression and altered subcellular localization, suggesting the protective mechanism may reside in the loss of an interaction or function via mislocalization and/or loss of an essential transmembrane domain.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition most commonly affecting the ileum and colon. The aetiology of Crohn's disease is complex and may include defects in peptidoglycan recognition, and/or failures in the establishment of intestinal tolerance. We have recently described a novel constitutive endogenous delivery system for the translocation of nanomineral-antigen-peptidoglycan (NAP) conjugates to antigen presenting cells (APCs) in intestinal lymphoid patches. In mice NAP conjugate delivery to APCs results in high surface expression of the immuno-modulatory molecule programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1). Here we report that NAP conjugate positive APCs in human ileal tissues from individuals with ulcerative colitis and intestinal carcinomas, also have high expression of PD-L1. However, NAP-conjugate positive APCs in intestinal tissue from patients with Crohn's disease show selective failure in PD-L1 expression. Therefore, in Crohn's disease intestinal antigen taken up by lymphoid patch APCs will be presented without PD-L1 induced tolerogenic signalling, perhaps initiating disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Approximately one-third of children with ulcerative colitis will experience at least 1 attack of acute severe colitis (ASC) before 15 years of age. Severe disease can be defined in children when Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index is >65 and/or >/=6 bloody stools per day, and/or 1 of the following: tachycardia, fever, anemia, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate with or without systemic toxicity. Our aim was to provide practical suggestions on the management of ASC in children. The goal of medical therapy is to avoid colectomy while preventing complications of disease, side effects of medications, and mortality. METHODS: A systematic search was carried out through Medline via PubMed to identify all articles published in English to date, based on the following keywords "ulcerative colitis," "pediatric ulcerative colitis," "biological therapy," and "acute severe colitis." Multidisciplinary clinical evaluation is recommended to identify early nonresponders to conventional treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, and to start, if indicated, second-line therapy or "rescue therapy," such as calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) and anti-tumor necrosis factor molecules (infliximab). RESULTS: Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index is a valid predictive tool that can guide clinicians in evaluating response to therapy. Surgery should be considered in the case of complications or rapid clinical deterioration during medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Several pitfalls may be present in the management of ASC, and a correct clinical and therapeutic approach is recommended to reduce surgical risk.},

   abstract = {The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease, are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract most often diagnosed in adolescence and young adulthood, with a rising incidence in pediatric populations. These disorders are common enough in children that most pediatricians and other pediatric clinicians will encounter children with IBD in their general practice. Inflammatory bowel disease is caused by a dysregulated mucosal immune response to the intestinal microflora in genetically predisposed hosts. Although children can present with the classic symptoms of weight loss, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, many present with nonclassic symptoms of isolated poor growth, anemia, or other extraintestinal manifestations. Once IBD is diagnosed, the goals of therapy consist of eliminating symptoms, normalizing quality of life, restoring growth, and preventing complications while minimizing the adverse effects of medications. Unique considerations when treating children and adolescents with IBD include attention to the effects of the disease on growth and development, bone health, and psychosocial functioning. The purpose of this review is to provide a contemporary overview of the epidemiologic features, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of IBD in children and adolescents.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC), the most aggressive presentation of ulcerative colitis (UC), occurs in 15% of adults and children with UC. First line therapy with intravenous corticosteroids is ineffective in half of adults and one-third of children. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against TNF (anti-TNF therapy) are emerging as a common treatment for ASUC due to their similar efficacy to calcineurin inhibitors and more favourable adverse effect profile. AIM: To comprehensively review the evidence for anti-TNF therapy for ASUC in children and adults with regard to outcomes and pharmacokinetics. METHODS: PubMed and recent conference proceedings were searched using the terms 'ulcerative colitis', 'acute severe ulcerative colitis', 'anti-TNF', 'pharmacokinetics' and the generic names of specific anti-TNF agents. RESULTS: Outcomes after anti-TNF therapy for ASUC remain suboptimal with about one half of children and adults undergoing colectomy. While several randomised controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of anti-TNF therapy for ambulatory patients with moderate to severely active UC, patients in these studies were less ill than those with ASUC. Patients with ASUC may exhibit more rapid clearance of anti-TNF biologics due to pharmacokinetic mechanisms influenced by disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional weight-based dosing effective in patients with moderately to severely active UC, may not be equally effective in those with acute severe ulcerative colitis. Personalised anti-TNF dosing strategies, which integrate patient factors and early measures of pharmacokinetics and response, hold promise for ensuring sustained drug exposure and maximising early mucosal healing in patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: Hydroxytyrosol acetate (HTy-Ac), an extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) polyphenol, has recently been reported to exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-stimulated macrophagesand ulcerative colitis. This study was designed to evaluate dietary HTy-Ac supplementation effects on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: DBA-1/J mice were fed from weaning with 0.05% HTy-Ac. After 6 weeks, arthritis was induced by type II collagen. Mice were sacrificed 42 days after first immunization. Blood was recollected and paws were histological and biochemically processed. HTy-Ac diet significantly prevent edarthritis development and decreased serum IgG1 and IgG2a, cartilage olimeric matrix protein (COMP) and metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) levels, as well as, pro-inflammatory cytokines levels (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-17A). The activation of Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathways were drastically ameliorated whereas nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expressions were significantly up-regulated in those mice fed with HTy-Ac. CONCLUSION: HTy-Ac improved the oxidative events and returned pro-inflammatory proteins expression to basal levels probably through JAK/STAT, MAPKs and NF-kappaB pathways. HTy-Ac supplement might provide a basis for developing a new dietary strategy for the prevention of rheumatoid arthritis.},

   abstract = {Elemental diet (ED) has been used widely in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, especially with the management of Crohn's disease. This modality of diets provides all essential nutrients, and contains protein in the form of free amino acids that are theoretically easily absorbed. High output ileostomies are a rare but important complications of stoma formation following bowel surgery. Treatments could be challenging and include anti-diarrhoeals, octreotide and proton pump inhibitors. There is very little research regarding the use of elemental diets in the treatment of patients with post-operative high ileostomy outputs. Adequate management of high output ileostomies might prevent significant morbidity. In this case report, we describe a patient who underwent a subtotal colectomy for ulcerative colitis complicated by refractory high ileostomy output despite maximal standard medical therapy for years. The ileostomy output was dramatically reduced following the introduction of an elemental diet. This case suggests a possible role for the introduction of an elemental diet in the management of high output ileostomies. Besides presenting this case with high output ileostomy, we reviewed the role of ED in other gastrointestinal disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although paediatric-onset IBD is becoming more common, few medications have a registered paediatric indication. There are multiple hurdles to performing clinical trials in children, emphasising the importance of choosing an appropriate outcome measure, which can facilitate enrolment, and thereby also drug approval. The aim of this consensus statement is to highlight paediatric specific issues and key factors critical for the optimal conduct of paediatric IBD trials. DESIGN: The Paediatric European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) committee has established an international expert panel to determine the best outcome measures in paediatric IBD, following a literature search and a modified Delphi process. All recommendations were endorsed by at least 80% agreement. RESULTS: Recognising the importance of mucosal healing (MH), the panel defined steroid-free MH as primary outcome measure for all drugs of new category with one or two postintervention endoscopies per trial (at 8-12 weeks and/or 54 weeks). Since endoscopic evaluation is a barrier for recruitment in children, trials with medications already shown to induce MH in children or adults, could use paediatric-specific disease activity scores as primary outcome, including a modified Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index in Crohn's disease and the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index in UC. Secondary outcomes should include safety issues, MR enterography-based damage and inflammatory scores (in Crohn's disease), faecal calprotectin, quality of life scales, and a patient-reported outcome. CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial to perform paediatric trials early in the development of new drugs in order to reduce off-label use of IBD medication in children. The thoughtful choice of feasible and standardised outcome measures can help move us towards this goal.},

The interleukin-6 (IL-6)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 signaling regulates survival and proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD and CRC. Cocoa is enriched with polyphenols that known to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities. Here, we explored the antitumor effects and mechanisms of cocoa diet on colitis-associated cancer (CAC) using the azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium model, with a particular focus on whether cocoa exerts its anticancer effect through the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. We found that cocoa significantly decreased the tumor incidence and size in CAC-induced mice. In addition to inhibiting proliferation of tumor epithelial cells, cocoa suppressed colonic IL-6 expression and subsequently activation of STAT3. Thus, our findings demonstrated that cocoa diet suppresses CAC tumorigenesis, and its antitumor effect is partly mediated by limiting IL-6/STAT3 activation. In addition, cocoa induces apoptosis by increased the expressions of Bax and caspase 3 and decreased Bcl-xl. Thus, we conclude that cocoa may be a potential agent in the prevention and treatment of CAC.},

There has been a continuous search for markers for disease activity. Eosinophils are granulocytic leukocytes that are implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and significance of peripheral eosinophilia (PE) at diagnosis in children with IBD. METHODS: A comprehensive chart review of all children with diagnosed as having IBD between January 2006 and August 2014 was performed. Patients with PE at diagnosis were compared with those without in relation to disease clinical activity and disease course. RESULTS: A total of 109 children (mean age 14.6 +/- 2.77, range 4.5-17.9 years, 55 boys) with IBD (68 with CD and 41 with UC) who were studied for a mean duration of 2.82 +/- 1.89 (range 0.1-9.2 years) were identified. At diagnosis, 44 (40.4%) children had PE, which was more prevalent in patients with UC compared with those with CD (61.3% vs 36.3%, P < 0.05). At diagnosis, PE was more common in patients with high eosinophilic count in colonic biopsy samples (P < 0.01) and was significantly associated with disease activity as indicated by Pediatric CD Activity Index for children with CD (P < 0.05), Pediatric UC Activity Index for children with UC (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: PE is a common finding at diagnosis in children with IBD especially in those with UC. Patients with PE at diagnosis are more likely to present with higher clinical activity indices. PE is associated with more eosinophils in colonic biopsy samples.},

A number of fermented dairy products contain lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria, some of which have been characterized as probiotics that can modify the gut microbiota and may be beneficial for the treatment and the prevention of IBD. The objective of this review was to carry out a systematic search of LAB and bifidobacteria probiotics and IBD, using the PubMed and Scopus databases, defined by a specific equation using MeSH terms and limited to human clinical trials. The use of probiotics and/or synbiotics has positive effects in the treatment and maintenance of UC, whereas in CD clear effectiveness has only been shown for synbiotics. Furthermore, in other associated IBD pathologies, such as pouchitis and cholangitis, LAB and bifidobacteria probiotics can provide a benefit through the improvement of clinical symptoms. However, more studies are needed to understand their mechanisms of action and in this way to understand the effect of probiotics prior to their use as coadjuvants in the therapy and prevention of IBD conditions.},

Deterioration of this delicate process may result in devastating autoinflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which primarily comprises Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Efficacious interventions to regulate proinflammatory signals, which play critical roles in IBD, require further scientific investigation. We recently demonstrated that rebalancing intestinal immunity via the surface layer protein A (SlpA) from Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM potentially represents a feasible therapeutic approach to restore intestinal homeostasis. To expand on these findings, we established a new method of purifying bacterial SlpA, a new SlpA-specific monoclonal antibody, and found no SlpA-associated toxicity in mice. Thus, these data may assist in our efforts to determine the immune regulatory efficacy of SlpA in humans.},

   abstract = {Fisetin, a dietary flavonoid, is commonly found in many fruits and vegetables. Although studies indicate that fisetin has an anti-inflammatory property, little is known about its effects on intestinal inflammation. The present study investigated the effects of the fisetin on dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis, an animal model that resembles human inflammatory bowel disease. Fisetin treatment to DSS-exposed mice significantly reduced the severity of colitis and alleviated the macroscopic and microscopic signs of the disease. Moreover, fisetin reduced the levels of myeloperoxidase activity, the production of proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the expressions of COX-2 and iNOS in the colon tissues. Further studies revealed that fisetin suppressed the activation of NF-kappaB (p65) by inhibiting IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and NF-kappaB (p65)-DNA binding activity and attenuated the phosphorylation of Akt and the p38, but not ERK and JNK MAPKs in the colon tissues of DSS-exposed mice. In addition, DSS-induced decline in reduced glutathione (GSH) and the increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly restored by oral fisetin. Furthermore, the results from in vitro studies showed that fisetin significantly reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokine and mediator release and suppressed the degradation and phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha with subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB (p65) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse primary peritoneal macrophages. These results suggest that fisetin exerts anti-inflammatory activity via inhibition of Akt, p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling in the colon tissues of DSS-exposed mice. Thus, fisetin may be a promising candidate as pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.},

Qing Dai has been traditionally used in Chinese herbal medicine for various inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis. We previously reported that Qing Dai suppressed inflammations by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ulcerative colitis patients. Thus, Qing Dai can attenuate the production of ROS, which play an important role in NSAID-induced gastrointestinal injuries. In this study, we aimed to elucidate whether Qing Dai decreased mitochondrial ROS production in NSAID-treated gastrointestinal cells by examining cellular injury, mitochondrial membrane potentials, and ROS production with specific fluorescent indicators. We also performed electron paramagnetic resonance measurement in isolated mitochondria with a spin-trapping reagent (CYPMPO or DMPO). Treatments with indomethacin and aspirin induced cellular injury and mitochondrial impairment in the gastrointestinal cells. Under these conditions, mitochondrial alterations were observed on electron microscopy. Qing Dai prevented these complications by suppressing ROS production in gastrointestinal cells. These results indicate that Qing Dai attenuated the ROS production from the NSAID-induced mitochondrial alteration in the gastrointestinal epithelial cells. Qing Dai treatment may be considered effective for the prevention NSAID-induced gastrointestinal injury.},

This study was designed to evaluate whether resveratrol, an excellent anti-oxidant agent, can help in treatment of UC and its related oxidative stress. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty six patients with active mild to moderate disease were randomized to receive either 500 mg/day resveratrol capsules or the same amount of placebo for 6 weeks. Before and after the intervention, disease activity, quality of life, and oxidative stress were assessed using the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index Questionnaire (SCCAIQ), Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-9 (IBDQ-9), and serum level of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC), respectively. Serum SOD (122.28 +/- 11.55 to 125.77 +/- 10.97) and TAC (9.87 +/- 1.51-11.97 +/- 1.61) increased, whereas serum MDA (5.62 +/- 1.18-3.42 +/- 1.01) decreased significantly in resveratrol group (p <0.001). Moreover, resveratrol supplementation significantly decreased disease activity and increased the quality of life (p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that 500 mg/day resveratrol supplementation can improve the disease activity and quality of life in patients with UC at least partially through reduction of oxidative stress. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dosage of supplementation for these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory disease in which reducing pro-inflammatory and/or increasing anti-inflammatory molecules is the mainstay of treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementation with resveratrol as an antiinflammatory and antioxidant agent on inflammation and quality of life in patients with active UC. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 50 eligible patients with active mild to moderate UC were supplemented with either a 500-mg resveratrol or placebo capsule for 6 weeks. Serum inflammatory markers, activity of NF-kappaB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and quality of life were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. Resveratrol supplementation led to a significant reduction in plasma levels of TNF-alpha (19.70 +/- 12.80 to 17.20 +/- 10.09 pg/mL) and hs-CRP (4764.25 +/- 2260.48 to 2584.50 +/- 1792.80 ng/mL) and activity of NF-kappaB in PBMCs (0.19 +/- 0.05 to 0.10 +/- 0.04 OD) (p <0.001), whereas there were no significant changes of these factors in placebo group. Also, the score of inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire -9 (IBDQ-9) increased, whereas the clinical colitis activity index score decreased significantly in the resveratrol group (32.72 +/- 7.52 to 47.64 +/- 8.59) (p <0.001) and when compared with the placebo group (35.54 +/- 9.50 to 41.08 +/- 6.59) (p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that 6 weeks supplementation with 500 mg resveratrol can improve quality of life and disease clinical colitis activity at least partially through inflammation reduction in patients with UC. Whether these effects will be continued in longer duration of treatment remains to be determined.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Fiber definition includes all those carbohydrates which are not digested nor absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract allowing them to reach the colon with no previous processing. Traditionally fiber has been classified according to their solubility into soluble and insoluble and different physiological properties have been defined for each type. The physiologic role of the fiber intake has been studied in diabetes, dyslipidemia or obesity. Fiber intake has also demonstrated to be beneficial in the prevention of many neoplastic diseases like colorectal cancer. It s also known that fiber plays an important role in the faecal excretion of nitrogen. AIM: To evaluate the current evidence that fiber intake plays in the management and prevention of several different diseases, being able to determine, if possible, the most recommended fiber type for each clinical condition. METHODS: A non-systematic review by searching the Medline and Pubmed was made and studies which met the inclusion criteria were identified and selected for analysis. RESULTS: Different fiber types can be useful for the treatment of several gastrointestinal diseases like constipation, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis remission or short bowel syndrome. Patients diagnosed with diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and other cardiometabolic diseases can get a clinical improvement with soluble fiber intake. Dietary fiber has demonstrated to play a role in the prevention of colorrectal cancer and other neoplastic diseases. Patients with hepatic encephalopathy or chronic kidney disease will also benefit from fermentable fiber intake. DISCUSSION: Fiber plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of many clinical conditions. However further investigations are needed to establish specific fiber intake recommendations.},

   abstract = {Hydroxytyrosol, a polyphenolic compound from extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has exhibited an improvement in a model of DSS-induced colitis. However, other phenolic compounds present such as hydroxytyrosyl acetate (HTy-Ac) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) need to be explored to complete the understanding of the overall effects of EVOO on inflammatory colon mucosa. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of both HTy-Ac and DHPG dietary supplementation in the inflammatory response associated to colitis model. Six-week-old mice were randomized in four dietary groups: sham and control groups received standard diet, and other two groups were fed with HTy-Ac and DHPG, respectively, at 0.1%. After 30 days, all groups except sham received 3% DSS in drinking water for 5 days followed by a regime of 5 days of water. Acute inflammation was evaluated by Disease Activity Index (DAI), histology and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Colonic expression of iNOS, COX-2, MAPKs, NF-kB and FOXP3 were determined by western blotting. Only HTy-Ac-supplemented group showed a significant DAI reduction as well as an improvement of histological damage and MPO. COX-2 and iNOS protein expression were also significantly reduced. In addition, this dietary group down-regulated JNK phosphorylation and prevented the DSS-induced nuclear translocation level of p65. However, no significant differences were observed in the FOXP3 expression. These results demonstrated, for the first time, that HTy-Ac exerts an antiinflammatory effect on acute ulcerative colitis. We concluded that HTy-Ac supplement might provide a basis for developing a new dietary strategy for the prevention of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: Squalene is a polyunsaturated triterpene, which has exhibited anticancer and antioxidant activities among others. We investigated dietary squalene supplementation effect on an acute colitis model induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in C57BL/6 mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice were fed from weaning with squalene at 0.02% and 0.1%. After 4 weeks, mice were exposed to 3% DSS for 5 days developing acute colitis. After DSS removal (5 days), colons were histological and biochemically processed. Our results showed that dietary squalene treatment exerts anti-inflammatory action in DSS-induced acute colitis. Western blot revealed that squalene downregulated COX-2 (where COX is cyclooxygenase) and inducible nitric oxide synthase system by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways, preventing an increase in the cytokines levels. Under our experimental conditions, STAT3 and FOXP3 (where FOXP3 is forkhead box P3) were not modified and the transcriptional regulation of antioxidant and/or detoxifying enzymes, Nrf2 (where Nrf2 is nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2), was reduced in DSS-induced colitis. However, any change could be observed after squalene supplementation. CONCLUSION: Squalene was able to improve the oxidative events and returned proinflammatory proteins expression to basal levels probably through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways. However, supplementary studies are needed in order to provide a basis for developing a new dietary supplementation strategy.},

IP-10 expression is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis [UC]. We report efficacy and safety results from a dose-ranging induction study of eldelumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to IP-10, in moderately to severely active UC. METHODS: A total of 252 adults with UC [Mayo score >/= 6 and endoscopic subscore >/= 2] were randomised 1:1:1 to placebo or eldelumab 15 or 25 mg/kg administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8 and every other week thereafter. The primary endpoint was clinical remission [Mayo score </= 2; no individual subscale score > 1] at Week 11. Key secondary endpoints included Mayo score clinical response and mucosal healing at Week 11. RESULTS: Neither eldelumab 15 or 25 mg/kg resulted in significant increases vs placebo in the proportion of patients achieving Week 11 clinical remission. Remission and response rates were 17.6% and 47.1% with eldelumab 25mg/kg, 13.1% and 44.0% with eldelumab 15mg/kg, and 9.6% and 31.3% with placebo. Clinical remission and response rates were higher in anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-naive patients treated with eldelumab compared with placebo. Eldelumab treatment was well tolerated and no immunogenicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The primary endpoint was not achieved with induction treatment with eldelumab 15 or 25 mg/kg in patients with UC. Trends towards clinical remission and response were observed in the overall population and were more pronounced in anti-TNF naive patients. Eldelumab safety signals were consistent with those reported previously [ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01294410].},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An increasing body of evidence has linked diet to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Most of our current knowledge pertains to the link between diet and Crohn's disease. Exclusive enteral nutrition and partial enteral nutrition are the best known dietary intervention for the induction of remission and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease both in children and in adults, but the mechanism whereby these interventions may cause or maintain remission and mucosal healing has remained elusive. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shed light on the possible mechanisms of response to dietary intervention. Epidemiological and rodent model studies over the last year have supplied us with several dietary candidates for an effect of diet on inflammation and disease pathogenesis. Others have shed insight into the effect of diet on dysbiosis and the microbiota. An elimination diet based on some of these candidates has shown clinical efficacy, and bridged the knowledge obtained from rodent models to a human intervention. SUMMARY: These studies may allow better understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD and provide new tools to treat these difficult diseases. Elimination diets based on the identification of deleterious dietary components may pave the way for an improved control of the disease in the future. VIDEO ABSTRACT: http://links.lww.com/COG/A10.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic debilitating disorders of unknown etiology, consisting of two main conditions, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Major advances have recently taken place in human genetic studies of IBD and over 160 risk loci for these two diseases have been uncovered. These genetic data highlight a key role for genes that code for immunological and epithelial barrier functions. Environmental factors also make substantial contributions to the pathogenesis of IBD and account for the growing incidence of the diseases around the world. Intestinal microbiota creates resistance to infection, provides nutrients, and educates the immune system and in many ways has a significant impact on human health. Aberrant microbiota composition and decreased diversity (dysbiotic microbiota) are key etiopathological events in IBD. Dysbiotic microbiota can lead to loss of normal, regulatory immune effects in the gut mucosa. This may play a central role in the development and perpetuation of chronic inflammation. Further, the expression of specific innate immune receptors that recognize microbes is altered in the IBD epithelium. Therefore, the combination of host side epithelial barrier functions and the presence of dysbiotic microbiota in the gut together promote inflammation. New therapeutic options targeting microbiota are currently considered for IBD and they may, in the future, provide means to reverse the pathogenic host-microbiota relationship into a symbiotic one. In this review, the focus is on the intestinal microbiota and host-microbe interactions in IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Data to support treatment algorithms in ambulatory paediatric UC are scarce. We aimed to explore the 1 year outcome in an inception cohort of paediatric UC patients and to identify early predictors of good outcome that might serve as short term treatment targets. DESIGN: A chart review of 115 children with new onset UC was performed (age 11 +/- 4.1 years; 58 (50%) males; 86 (75%) extensive colitis; 70 (61%) moderate-severe disease; 63 (55%) received steroids at baseline). We assessed the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and laboratory variables at the time of diagnosis and at 3 months, and endoscopy at diagnosis. RESULTS: The 3 month PUCAI was the strongest predictor of 1 year sustained steroid free remission (SSFR) (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)=0.7 (95% CI 0.6 to 0.8) and colectomy by 2 years (AUROC=0.75 (0.6 to 0.89)). SSFR was achieved in 9/54 (17%) children who had active disease (PUCAI >/= 10) at 3 months (negative predictive value (NPV)=83%) and by 4/46 (8.6%) of those with a PUCAI score >10; (NPV=91%, positive predictive value=52%; p<0.001), implying that PUCAI >10 at 3 months has a probability of 9% for achieving SSFR versus 48% with a PUCAI value of </=10. None of the variables at baseline was predictive of SSFR or colectomy (endoscopic severity, disease extent, age, PUCAI or C reactive protein/erythrocyte sedimentation rate/albumin/haemoglobin; all AUROC<0.6, p>0.05) but baseline PUCAI predicted subsequent acute severe colitis and the need for salvage medical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Completeness of the early response appears more important than baseline UC severity for predicting outcome in children, and supports using PUCAI<10 as a feasible treatment goal. Our data suggest that treatment escalation should be considered with a PUCAI value of >/= 10 at 3 months.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition with numerous nutrition implications, including an increased risk of malnutrition and various nutrient deficiencies. Surgical interventions are often necessary in the treatment of IBD, and patients with IBD presenting for surgery often have multiple issues, including acute inflammatory processes, malnutrition, anemia, and infections, which may increase the likelihood of poor surgical outcomes. Thus, determining adjunctive treatments that may decrease postoperative complications is paramount. Although enteral nutrition (EN) is considered the preferred nutrition support modality when the gastrointestinal tract is accessible and functional, parenteral nutrition (PN) may provide a suitable alternative when the use of EN is not feasible. The aim of this review is to evaluate the currently available literature on the impact of perioperative PN on postoperative complications, disease severity, and nutrition status in adults with IBD. Six studies within the past 10 years investigated this topic and are analyzed here. Results indicate general trends toward improvements in postoperative outcomes, disease severity, and nutrition status associated with perioperative PN use. Although results appear promising, additional, larger studies with an emphasis on PN composition will improve our understanding of the benefits of perioperative PN in adults with IBD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coloproctomucosectomy (CPM) with ileopouchanal anastomosis (IPAA), as the procedure of choice for surgical management of ulcerative colitis (UC), is commonly performed either as a 2- or 3-staged procedure. For patients with considerable immunosuppression, reduced nutritional or general health status, and as part of emergency treatment, a 3-staged (3S) procedure is recommended by guidelines to minimize perioperative complication rates compared to 2-staged (2S) procedure. However, the necessity of additional hospitalization and surgery is suspect to affect quality of life (QoL). In this prospective, observational study, we evaluate the long-term QoL after 2- and 3-staged interventions of CPM with IPAA for patients with UC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1997 and 2011, a total of 233 patients underwent CPM and had a 2- or 3-staged procedure. In 108 patients, surgical procedure was completed, and evaluation of QoL was performed by specific questionnaires (IBDQ, FIQoL, SF-12, CCS) up to 20 years after ileostomy closure. Data were collected within the framework of a prospective study. RESULTS: Observing a total of 84 patients (2S: n = 59; 3S: n = 25), QoL measured by IBDQ was higher after CPM, compared to preoperative (2S: 15 --> 31; 3S: 17 --> 28; p < 0.01), with no differences between 2S or 3S procedures (p > 0.05). Specific QoL assessment concerning incontinence and stool frequency (CCS, FIQoL) did not differ either (CCS: 2S:3S = 12:15; p > 0.05). General health-related QoL, determined by SF-12 score, did not differ between 2S or 3S procedures. CONCLUSION: The indication for a 2-staged or 3-staged procedure should be adjusted to the severity of the underlying disease, nutritional status of the patient, and the extent of immunosuppression at the time of surgery. It should not be affected by the fear of complications or a reduced quality of life by additional surgery in 3-staged versus 2-staged procedures.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity has been linked with a proinflammatory state and the development of inflammatory diseases. Data on the clinical course and treatment of obese patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are limited. We used an institutional IBD registry to investigate the impact of obesity on IBD severity and treatment. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data for 3 years (2009-2011). Patients with IBD were categorized by body mass index (BMI). IBD-related quality of life, biochemical markers of inflammation, comorbidities, health care utilization, and treatment were characterized. Obesity was defined as a BMI >/=30 (type I: 30-34.9, type II: 35-39.9, and type III >/=40). RESULTS: Among 1494 patients with IBD, 71.9% were above their ideal BMI and 31.5% were obese. Obesity was more common in ulcerative colitis compared with patients with Crohn's disease (P = 0.04). Obese class II and class III patients were predominantly female. Obesity in IBD was associated with female gender (P < 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (P < 0.001), hypertension (P < 0.001), hyperlipidemia (P < 0.001), poor quality of life (P < 0.0001), and increased rates of C-reactive protein elevation (P = 0.008). In logistic regression analysis, quality of life and C-reactive protein elevation were not independently correlated with obesity. There was no association between increasing BMI and annual prednisone use, emergency department visits, hospitalization, and surgery. Obesity was associated with lower milligrams per kilogram doses of purine analogs and biologics. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity in IBD is not associated with increased health care utilization and IBD-related surgeries. Optimal regimens for drug dosing in obese patients with IBD have yet to be defined.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and unclassified IBD, continues to cause significant morbidity. While its incidence is increasing, no clear etiology and no cure have yet been discovered. Recent findings suggest that IBD may have a multifactorial etiology, where complex interactions between genetics, epigenetics, environmental factors (including diet but also infections, antibiotics, and sanitation), and host immune system lead to abnormal immune responses and chronic inflammation. Over the past years, the role of altered gut microbiota (in both composition and function) in IBD pathogenesis has emerged as an outstanding area of interest. According to new findings, gut dysbiosis may appear as a key element in initiation of inflammation in IBD and its complications. Moreover, complex metagenomic studies provide possibilities to distinguish between IBD types and appreciate severity and prognosis of the disease, as well as response to therapy. This review provides an updated knowledge of recent findings linking altered bacterial composition and functions, viruses, and fungi to IBD pathogenesis. It also highlights the complex genetic, epigenetic, immune, and microbial interactions in relation to environmental factors (including diet). We overview the actual options to manipulate the altered microbiota, such as modified diet, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal transplantation. Future possible therapies are also included. Targeting altered microbiota could be the next therapeutic personalized approach, but more research and well-designed comparative prospective studies are required to formulate adequate directions for prevention and therapy.},

The aim of this study was to determine the role of adiposity on bone mass in the first 3 y of diagnosis of IBD. The expected result is that increased adiposity will be associated with increased bone mass in both the controls and IBD subjects. METHODS: Height-adjusted bone mineral density (BMD) z-scores of 25 subjects, age 13.97 +/- 2.70 y, diagnosed with IBD for <4 y were compared to 24 controls, age 13.65 +/- 2.60 y. Overweight was defined as BMI of >/=85th but <95th percentile, and obesity as BMI >/=95th percentile. Severity of IBD was determined by the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index and Lichtiger Colitis Activity Index. RESULTS: Before stratification by BMI criterion, height-adjusted BMD z-scores were not significantly lower in IBD subjects versus controls for both the femoral neck (-0.8 +/- 1.1 versus -0.06 +/- 1.1, P = 0.070) and lumbar vertebrae (-0.4 +/- 1.2 versus 0.2 +/- 1.2, P = 0.086). Following stratification, height-adjusted BMD z-scores were significantly lower in the overweight/obese IBD subjects versus overweight/obese controls for femoral neck (-0.9 +/- 0.9 versus 0.3 +/- 1.3, P = 0.032); and non-significantly lower for the lumbar spine z-score (-0.4 +/- 1.6 versus 0.5 +/- 1.3, P = 0.197). BMD z-score had no relationship with the duration of disease, steroid therapy, and the severity of disease. CONCLUSION: Adiposity was associated with reduced bone mass in the early phases of IBD, but with increased bone mass in the controls.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders characterized by a complex disruption of the physiologic interaction between the host immune system and intestinal microbes precipitated by environmental factors. Numerous observations indicate the altered composition and function of the intestinal microbiome of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), a subtype of IBD. The accuracy of these results may be limited by confounding factors, such as concurrent medication use. To address these limitations, we examined the colonic mucosal microbiome of pediatric patients with UC prior to initiating treatment. Based on bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we identified a significant decrease in the phylum Verrucomicrobia in patients with UC. At the genus level, we observed a significant decrease in the short chain fatty acid producer Roseburia. Despite these compositional changes, we did not identify inferred gene content differences between the UC and control groups. To determine if microbial taxa may be associated with clinical outcomes, we retrospectively assessed the clinical course of the UC patients. Despite similar metrics of OTU richness and diversity, multiple OTU differences were observed between patients who responded to therapy and those who did not. Our observations regarding the mucosal microbiome and the associations with differential clinical outcomes support the contributions of gut microbes to disease onset and modulation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systemic corticosteroids (CS) are a mainstay of treatment for patients with newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous population-based studies report CS exposure rates range from 39 to 75 % within the first year of diagnosis with surgical resection rates as high as 13-18 % in the same time frame. These reports represent an older cohort of patients enrolled over prolonged periods of time and do not necessarily reflect current treatment approaches. We examine CS use during the first year of IBD diagnosis in a community-based, inception cohort. METHODS: Data were derived from the Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry (OSCCAR), a prospective inception cohort of IBD patients who are residents of Rhode Island. RESULTS: A total of 272 patients were included in the current analyses. Overall, 60 % of Crohn's disease and 57 % of ulcerative colitis patients were exposed to at least one course of CS during year 1 of study enrollment. Most notably, only 2 % of patients (n = 5) required a surgical resection. CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based cohort, 59 % of patients were exposed to at least one course of CS during their first year of enrollment. In contrast to previous studies, OSCCAR represents a more modern cohort of patients. While steroid exposure rates were similar or slightly higher than those in previous reports, we observed a low rate of surgical resection. As our cohort ages, future analysis will focus on the role more contemporary agents may play on the low rates of surgery we observed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies describing the incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are uncommon in the United States. We sought to determine the incidence of CD and UC in the state of Rhode Island. METHODS: The Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry is a state-based inception cohort of patients newly diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Rhode Island. To confirm a diagnosis of CD, UC, or IBD unclassified (IBDU), the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases IBD Genetics Consortium criteria were applied in a review of medical records from gastroenterology practices located in the state of Rhode Island and adjacent to the Rhode Island border in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Using population-based data, we determined the statewide incidence of IBD in Rhode Island from 2008 to 2010. RESULTS: A total of 971 Rhode Island residents were diagnosed with IBD, including 444 with CD, 486 with UC, and 41 with IBD unclassified from 2008 to 2010. The overall age- and sex-adjusted IBD incidence was 30.2 (95% confidence interval, 28.3-32.1) per 100,000 persons in this time frame with 13.9, 15.1, and 1.3 per 100,000 diagnosed with CD, UC, and IBD unclassified, respectively. Of the total incident cases in Rhode Island, 30% (n = 291) were enrolled in Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry for follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IBD in Rhode Island is higher than that previously reported by other population-based cohorts in the United States. Prospective follow-up of individuals enrolled in the community-based Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry cohort is ongoing.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an intestinal chronic inflammatory condition and includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). It has been proposed that Vitamin D supplementation may have a beneficial role in IBD. AIM: To characterize the effects of Vitamin D on cathelicidin (hCAP/LL37) gene expression, ESR, and serum hs-CRP levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety UC patients on remission were randomized to receive 300,000 IU intramuscular Vitamin D or 1 mL normal saline as placebo, respectively. Before and 90 days after intervention, serum levels of 25 (OH)-Vitamin D3, PTH, Calcium, ESR, and hs-CRP were measured. Cathelicidin gene expression was also quantified using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Baseline serum 25-OH-Vitamin D3 levels were not different between the two groups and after intervention, increased only in Vitamin D group (P < 0.001). Hs-CRP levels were lower in Vitamin D group after intervention (Before: 3.43 +/- 3.47 vs 3.86 +/- 3.55 mg/L, P = 0.56; after: 2.31 +/- 2.25 vs 3.90 +/- 3.97 mg/L, P= 0.023). ESR decreased significantly in Vitamin D group (Before: 12.4 +/- 6.1 vs 12.1 +/- 5.3 mm/h, P= 0.77; after: 6.7 +/- 4.5 vs 11.4 +/- 5.5 mm/h, P< 0.001). The mean fold change in hCAP18 gene expression in Vitamin D group was significantly higher than placebo group. (Mean +/- SD: 3.13 +/- 2.56 vs 1.09 +/- 0.56; median +/- interquartile range: 2.17 +/- 3.81 vs 0.87 +/- 0.53, P< 0.001). CONCLUSION: Decreases in ESR and hs-CRP levels and increase in LL37 gene expression support the hypothesis that Vitamin D supplementation may have a beneficial role in UC patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) is a novel imaging modality that enables virtual optical biopsy in vivo. Loss of barrier function of the small bowel observed via pCLE as increased density of epithelial gaps (extrusion zones left in the intestinal lining after cells are shed) is predictive of relapse in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aims to determine whether such observations on pCLE are similarly predictive of disease relapse in pediatric patients with IBD. METHODS: Pediatric patients with biopsy-proven IBD underwent pCLE during colonoscopy and subsequent clinical follow-up every 6 months. Relapse was defined as moderate to severe flare with endoscopic evidence of inflammation during the follow-up period. The relations between epithelial gap density, disease relapse, and imaging parameters were determined using Cox models. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with IBD (13 with Crohn disease, 11 with ulcerative colitis) with a median age of 14 years (range 10-21) were studied for a median of 13 (4-33) months. The median duration of disease was 2.9 years (range 0-9). Increased epithelial gap density in the terminal ileum on pCLE of normal endoscopic appearing terminal ileum mucosa (N = 19) was predictive of disease relapse when 3 or more areas were imaged (N = 6, log-rank P = 0.02, C-statistic = 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients with IBD, barrier dysfunction observed on pCLE imaging of the small bowel was predictive of disease relapse.},

The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of stoss therapy on vitamin D levels during a period of 6 months in children with IBD and vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/L). METHODS: A retrospective chart review was undertaken, focusing upon children managed in the IBD clinic at Sydney Children's Hospital between 2006 and 2010. Those with a 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) level <50 nmol/L and those who received stoss therapy were included in this study. RESULTS: A total of 76 children received stoss therapy. There was a significant and sustained increase in 25-OHD levels at all of the time points compared with baseline (40.8 +/- 7.5 nmol/L), 1 month (145.6 +/- 51.8 nmol/L), 3 months (87.1 +/- 28.4 nmol/L), and 6 months 69.2 +/- 31.3 nmol/L). There were no significant changes in serum calcium, phosphate, or parathyroid hormone at any time points. CONCLUSIONS: Stoss therapy safely and effectively achieved and maintained a level of 25-OHD >50 nmol/L during 6 months in these children with IBD. Further prospective studies are now required to confirm this finding and establish whether this intervention has other benefits.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. Although corticosteroids may improve symptoms, they have significant adverse effects. Steroids which act topically, with less systemic side-effects may be more desirable. Budesonide is a topically acting corticosteroid with extensive first pass hepatic metabolism. There are currently three formulations of budesonide: two standard formulations including a controlled-ileal release capsule and a pH-dependent capsule both designed to release the drug in the distal small intestine and right colon; and the newer Budesonide-MMX(R) capsule designed to release the drug throughout the entire colon. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral budesonide for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialised Register from inception to April 2015. We also searched reference lists of articles, conference proceedings and ClinicalTrials.gov. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing oral budesonide to placebo or another active therapy for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis were considered eligible. There were no exclusions based on patient age or the type, dose, duration or formulation of budesonide therapy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed study quality. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. The primary outcome was induction of remission (as defined by the primary studies) at week eight. Secondary outcomes included clinical, endoscopic and histologic improvement, adverse events and early withdrawal. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for each dichotomous outcome and the mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% CI for each continuous outcome. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. MAIN RESULTS: Six studies (1808 participants) were included. Four studies compared budesonide-MMX(R) with placebo, one small pilot study looked at clinical remission at week four, and was subsequently followed by three large, studies that assessed combined clinical and endoscopic remission at week eight. Although two placebo-controlled studies had mesalamine and Entocort (standard budesonide) treatment arms, these studies were not sufficiently powered to compare Budesonide-MMX(R) with these active comparators. One small study compared standard budesonide with prednisolone and one study compared standard budesonide to mesalamine. Four studies were rated as low risk of bias and two studies had an unclear risk of bias. A pooled analysis of three studies (900 participants) showed that budesonide-MMX(R) 9 mg was significantly superior to placebo for inducing remission (combined clinical and endoscopic remission) at 8 weeks. Fifteen per cent (71/462) of budesonide-MMX(R) 9 mg patients achieved remission compared to 7% (30/438) of placebo patients (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.50 to 3.39). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (101 events). A subgroup analysis by concurrent mesalamine use suggests higher efficacy in the 442 patients who were not considered to be mesalamine-refractory (RR 2.89, 95% CI 1.59 to 5.25). A subgroup analysis by disease location suggests budesonide is most effective in patients with left-sided disease (RR 2.98, 95% CI 1.56 to 5.67; 289 patients). A small pilot study reported no statistically significant difference in endoscopic remission between budesonide and prednisolone (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.42; 72 patients). GRADE indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to unclear risk of bias and very sparse data (10 events). Standard oral budesonide was significantly less likely to induce clinical remission than oral mesalamine after 8 weeks of therapy (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91; 1 study, 343 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (161 events). Another study found no difference in remission rates between budesonide-MMX(R) 9 mg and mesalamine (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.71; 247 patients). GRADE indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (37 events). One study found no difference in remission rates between budesonide-MMX(R) 9 mg and standard budesonide 9 mg (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.65; 212 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (32 events). Suppression of plasma cortisol was more common in prednisolone-treated patients (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.33). While budesonide does appear to suppress morning cortisol to some extent, mean morning cortisol values remained within the normal range in 2 large studies (n = 899) and there was no difference in glucocorticoid-related side-effects across different treatment groups. Further, study withdrawal due to adverse events was not more common in budesonide compared with placebo treated patients (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.38). Common adverse events included worsening ulcerative colitis, headache, pyrexia, insomnia, back pain, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, flatulence and nasopharyngitis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate quality evidence to supports the use of oral budesonide-MMX(R) at a 9 mg daily dose for induction of remission in active ulcerative colitis, particularly in patients with left-sided colitis. Budesonide-MMX(R) 9 mg daily is effective for induction of remission in the presence or absence of concurrent 5-ASA therapy. Further, budesonide-MMX(R) appears to be safe, and does not lead to significant impairment of adrenocorticoid function compared to placebo. Moderate quality evidence from a single study suggests that mesalamine may be superior to standard budesonide for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis. Low quality evidence from one study found no difference in remission rates between budesonide MMX(R) and mesalamine. Very low quality evidence from one small study showed no difference in endoscopic remission rates between standard budesonide and prednisolone. Low quality evidence from one study showed no difference in remission rates between budesonide-MMX(R) and standard budesonide. Adequately powered studies are needed to allow conclusions regarding the comparative efficacy and safety of budesonide versus prednisolone, budesonide-MMX(R) versus standard budesonide and budesonide versus mesalamine.},

   abstract = {To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of beta-glucans from Lentinus edodes, and its molecular mechanism, the dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) induced colitis model of mice and the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cell inflammation model were used in this study. 40 ICR male mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: Control, DSS (DSS treated only), DSS + low-betaGs (500 mg kg-1 d-1) and DSS + high-betaGs (1000 mg kg-1 d-1). The body weight of the mice with Lentinus edodes beta-glucan supplementation increased significantly compared to the DSS group and the disease activity index (DAI) was improved in both betaG-treated groups. Compared with the DSS group, histopathological analysis showed that the infiltration of inflammatory cells of both betaG-treated groups decreased significantly in colonic tissues. Furthermore, oral administration of beta-glucans decreases the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) and inhibits the expression of iNOS and several inflammatory factors: TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 as well as nitric oxide (NO) of the colonic tissues. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is closely related to the expression of pro-inflammatory factors. In the DSS-induced colitis model and the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cell model, betaGs inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory factors and blocked the phosphorylation of JNK/ERK1/2 and p38; betaGs also suppress the phosphorylation of Elk-1 at Ser84 and the phosphorylation of PPARgamma at Ser112. Altogether, these results suggest that Lentinus edodes betaGs could inhibit the DSS-induced ulcerative colitis and decrease inflammatory factor expressions. The molecular mechanism may be involved in suppressing MAPK signaling and inactivation of Elk-1 and activation of PPARgamma.},

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of natural raw meal (NRM) on high-fat diet (HFD, 45%) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 2% w/v)-induced colitis in C57BL/6J mice. MATERIALS/METHODS: Body weight, colon length, and colon weight-to-length ratio, were measured directly. Serum levels of obesity-related biomarkers, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), insulin, leptin, and adiponectin were determined using commercial kits. Serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6 were detected using a commercial ELISA kit. Histological study was performed using a hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining assay. Colonic mRNA expressions of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were determined by RT-PCR assay. RESULTS: Body weight and obesity-related biomarkers (TG, TC, LDL, HDL, insulin, leptin, and adiponectin) were regulated and obesity was prevented in NRM treated mice. NRM significantly suppressed colon shortening and reduced colon weight-to-length ratio in HFD+DSS induced colitis in C57BL/6J mice (P < 0.05). Histological observations suggested that NRM reduced edema, mucosal damage, and the loss of crypts induced by HFD and DSS. In addition, NRM decreased the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 and inhibited the mRNA expressions of these cytokines, and iNOS and COX-2 in colon mucosa (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that NRM has an anti-inflammatory effect against HFD and DSS-induced colitis in mice, and that these effects are due to the amelioration of HFD and/or DSS-induced inflammatory reactions.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) predominantly affects young adults. Fertility-related issues are therefore important in the management of patients with IBD. However, relatively modest attention has been paid to reproductive issues faced by men with IBD. To investigate the effects of IBD and its treatment on male fertility, we reviewed the current literature using a systematic search for published studies. A PubMed search were performed using the main search terms "IBD AND male infertility", "Crohn's disease AND male infertility", "ulcerative colitis AND male infertility". References in review articles were used if relevant. We noted that active inflammation, poor nutrition, alcohol use, smoking, medications, and surgery may cause infertility in men with IBD. In surgery such as proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, rectal incision seems to be associated with sexual dysfunction. Of the medications used for IBD, sulfasalazine reversibly reduces male fertility. No other medications appear to affect male fertility significantly, although small studies suggested some adverse effects. There are limited data on the effects of drugs for IBD on male fertility and pregnancy outcomes; however, patients should be informed of the possible effects of paternal drug exposure. This review provides information on fertility-related issues in men with IBD and discusses treatment options.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although several noninvasive and easily accessible biomarkers for inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] are available, their sensitivity and specificity are not adequate to be used as single markers and do not overrule the need for endoscopic evaluation. We previously reported that serum leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein [LRG] was a novel biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis and IBD. We herein investigated whether LRG could indicate endoscopic activity in patients with ulcerative colitis [UC]. METHODS: Serum LRG concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] in consecutive 129 patients with UC in two tertiary care hospitals, and associations of LRG with clinical and endoscopic activities were evaluated. Clinical activity index [CAI] < 6 was defined as clinical remission, and mucosal healing [MH] and complete mucosal healing were defined as Matts' endoscopic grades of 1 or 2 and grade of 1, respectively. RESULTS: Serum LRG levels were significantly increased and correlated with clinical and endoscopic activities in patients with UC. LRG levels were associated with both clinical and endoscopic activities even in patients with normal serum C-reactive protein [CRP] levels. Furthermore, LRG levels were significantly lower in patients with complete MH and deep remission. Serial measurements of LRG levels in a subset of patients demonstrated that LRG was significantly elevated during the endoscopically active stage compared with that during the MH stage. CONCLUSIONS: Serum LRG is a novel biomarker for detecting MH during disease course in patients with UC and a surrogate marker of endoscopic inflammation in patients with normal CRP levels.},

   abstract = {Diet and inflammation have been suggested to be important risk factors for ulcerative colitis (UC). In this case-control study conducted in Iran, we examined the ability of the dietary inflammatory index (DII) to predict UC. This study included 62 UC cases and 124 controls hospitalized for acute non-neoplastic diseases. The DII was computed based on dietary intake assessed by a previously validated food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and the DII was analyzed as both continuous and as tertiles. Energy was adjusted using the residual method. Subjects with higher DII scores (i.e., with a more pro-inflammatory diet) had a higher risk of UC, with the DII being used as both a continuous variable (OR(continuous) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-2.32; one unit increase corresponding to approximately 8% of its range in the current study) and as tertiles (OR(tertile3vstertile1) 2.58, 95% CI 1.03-6.48, P(trend)| = |0.04). These results indicate that a pro-inflammatory diet is associated with increased risk of UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Substance P (SP), neurokinin-1 receptors (NK-1Rs) are expressed in mesenteric preadipocytes and SP binding activates proinflammatory signalling in these cells. We evaluated the expression levels of SP (Tac-1), NK-1R (Tacr-1), and NK-2R (Tacr-2) mRNA in preadipocytes isolated from patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and examined their responsiveness to SP compared to control human mesenteric preadipocytes. The Aim of our study is to investigate the effects of the neuropeptide SP on cytokine expression in preadipocytes of IBD vs control patients and evaluate the potential effects of these cells on IBD pathophysiology via SP-NK-R interactions. METHODS: Mesenteric fat was collected from control, Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients (n=10-11 per group). Preadipocytes were isolated, expanded in culture and exposed to substance P. Colon biopsies were obtained from control and IBD patients. RESULTS: Tacr-1 and -2 mRNA were increased in IBD preadipocytes compared to controls, while Tac-1 mRNA was increased only in UC preadipocytes. SP differentially regulated the expression of inflammatory mediators in IBD preadipocytes compared to controls. Disease-dependent responses to SP were also observed between UC and CD preadipocytes. IL-17A mRNA expression and release increased after SP treatment in both CD and UC preadipocytes, while IL-17RA mRNA increased in colon biopsies from IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Preadipocyte SP-NK-1R interactions during IBD may participate in IBD pathophysiology. The ability of human preadipocytes to release IL-17A in response to SP together with increased IL-17A receptor in IBD colon opens the possibility of a fat-colonic mucosa inflammatory loop that may be active during IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The growing incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children necessitates the use of biological treatments. Recently, an infliximab biosimilar was authorized in the European Union, which may result in switching patients. We present our preliminary experiences with such switches. METHODS: The prospective study included 32 paediatric patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) and 7 children with ulcerative colitis (UC) at 3 academic hospitals, who were switched from infliximab originator to its biosimilar (Remsima). Patient characteristics, disease severity, laboratory parameters and adverse events were recorded. Means, medians and ranges were calculated. RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis of CD and UC was 11.1 (2.7-15.3) and 12.3 years (8.5-14.8), respectively. Mean number of infliximab originator infusions before switching to the biosimilar was 9.9 (median 8, range 4-29) and 5.1 (5, 1-12) for the CD and UC group, respectively. Evaluation efficacy of last biosimilar doses of all patients revealed rates of clinical remission of 88 and 57% for CD and UC patients, respectively. Last follow-up assessment of patients who continued with biosimilar therapy showed that 16/20 (80%) CD patients and all 4 UC individuals were in remission. One infusion reaction to infliximab biosimilar was observed in a CD patient, which led to treatment discontinuation. The incidence of sporadic mild adverse events prior to and after switching did not differ significantly and was consistent with the safety profile of the infliximab molecule. CONCLUSION: Switching from infliximab originator to its biosimilar seems to be a safe option in children with CD. After the switch the biosimilar was just as effective as the originator.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), can result in significant morbidity requiring frequent health care utilization. Although it is known that the overall financial impact of pediatric IBD is significant, the direct out-of-pocket (OOP) cost burden on the parents of children with IBD has not been explored. We hypothesized that affected children with a more relapsing disease course and families in lower income strata, ineligible for need-based assistance programs, disparately absorb ongoing financial stress. METHODS: We completed a cross-sectional analysis among parents of children with IBD residing in California using an online HIPAA-secure Qualtrics survey. Multicenter recruitment occurred between December 4, 2013 and September 18, 2014 at the point-of-care from site investigators, informational flyers distributed at regional CCFA conferences, and social media campaigns equally targeting Northern, Central, and Southern California. IBD-, patient-, and family-specific information were collected from the parents of pediatric patients with IBD patients younger than 18 years of age at time of study, carry a confirmed diagnosis of CD or UC, reside in and receive pediatric gastroenterology care in California, and do not have other chronic diseases requiring ongoing medical care. RESULTS: We collected 150 unique surveys from parents of children with IBD (67 CD; 83 UC). The median patient age was 14 years for both CD and UC, with an overall 3.7 years (SD 2.8 yr) difference between survey completion and time of IBD diagnosis. Annually, 63.6%, 28.6%, and 5.3% of families had an OOP cost burden >$500, >$1000, and >5000, respectively. Approximately one-third (36.0%) of patients had emergency department (ED) visits over the past year, with 59.2% of these patients spending >$500 on emergency department copays, including 11.1% who spent >$5000. Although 43.3% contributed <$500 on procedure and test costs, 20.0% spent >$2000 in the past year. Families with household income between $50,000 and $100,000 had a statistically significant probability (80.6%) of higher annual OOP costs than families with lower income <$50,000 (20.0%; P < 0.0001) or higher income >$100,000 (64.6%; P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that clinical variables associated with uncontrolled IBD states correlated to higher OOP cost burden. Annual OOP costs were more likely to be >$500 among patients who had increased spending on procedures and tests (odds ratio [OR], 5.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.73-11.63), prednisone course required over the past year (OR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.02-9.92), at least 1 emergency department visit for IBD symptoms (OR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.33-6.06), at least 4 or more outpatient primary medical doctor visits for IBD symptoms (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.40-5.68), and history of 4 or more lifetime hospitalizations for acute IBD care (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.13-5.96). CONCLUSIONS: Previously undocumented, a high proportion of pediatric IBD families incur substantial OOP cost burden. Patients who are frequently in relapsing and uncontrolled IBD states require more acute care services and sustain higher OOP cost burden. Lower middle income parents of children with IBD ineligible for need-based assistance may be particularly at risk for financial stress from OOP costs related to ongoing medical care.},

We, therefore, describe the prevalence of EIMs in Indian IBD and ITB patients and study their relationship with disease extent and severity in IBD. METHODS: This retrospective single-center study included all IBD and ITB patients evaluated from January 2005 to July 2012. Disease profile and frequencies of arthropathies (peripheral and central) and ocular (episcleritis, iritis/uveitis), oral (aphthous stomatitis), skin (erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, psoriasis), hepatobiliary (primary sclerosing cholangitis), and thromboembolic manifestations were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1,652 patients (1146 UC, 303 CD, 203 ITB), frequency of any EIM was 33.2 %, 38.3 %, and 14.3 % in UC, CD, and ITB patients, respectively. Thromboembolism was more common among UC patients with pancolitis than proctitis (p < 0.001) and left-sided colitis (p = 0.02). Primary sclerosing cholangitis was seen in 0.4 % UC patients. Steroid-dependent UC patients had higher frequency of any EIM, peripheral arthropathy, or thromboembolism than patients with no or infrequent steroid requirement (p < 0.05). Peripheral arthropathy (p = 0.02), erythema nodosum (p = 0.01), and aphthous stomatitis (p = 0.004) were more common with CD than with UC patients. Patients with colonic CD had higher frequency of peripheral arthropathy, any EIM, and multiple EIMs than ileal or ileocolonic disease (p < 0.05). Relative to ITB, CD patients had higher frequencies of peripheral arthropathy (p < 0.001), aphthous stomatitis (p = 0.01), any EIM (p < 0.001), and multiple EIMs (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In Indian IBD and ITB patients, EIMs appear to be related to disease severity in UC and disease location in CD and are significantly more common in CD than in ITB. Overall prevalence of EIMs in these patients is similar to that of the West.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Though vedolizumab has received regulatory approval for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults, there is increasing off-label use in children. AIMS: To describe the experience with vedolizumab in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients at 3 tertiary IBD centers and examine predictors of remission. METHODS: A retrospective review identified pediatric IBD patients (age < 18 yrs) receiving vedolizumab. Data on demographics, disease behavior, location, activity, and previous treatments/surgeries were collected. Disease activity was assessed using the weighted pediatric CD activity index or pediatric UC activity index. Primary outcome was week 14 remission, defined as pediatric UC activity index <10 or weighted pediatric CD activity index <12.5. Descriptive statistics and univariate analyses were performed to examine associations of clinical characteristics with efficacy. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients, 58% CD and 42% UC, initiated vedolizumab between June 2014 and August 2015. Median age at vedolizumab initiation was 14.9 (range 7-17) years. Ninety percent had failed >/=1 anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent. Week 14 remission rates for UC and CD were 76% and 42%, respectively (P < 0.05). Eighty percent of anti-TNF-naive patients experienced week 14 remission. At week 22, anti-TNF-naive patients had higher remission rates than TNF-exposed patients (100% versus 45%, P = 0.04). There were no infusion reactions or serious adverse events/infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that vedolizumab is efficacious and safe in pediatric IBD patients, with UC patients experiencing earlier and higher rates of remission than CD patients. Anti-TNF-naive patients experienced higher remission rates than those with anti-TNF exposure. Controlled clinical trial data are needed to confirm these observations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis is frequently treated with total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis reconstruction. Causes of pouch failure and criteria for improved patient selection remain poorly understood. We aimed to identify risk factors for pouch failure. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients in a prospectively maintained database. Consecutive patients undergoing ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for inflammatory bowel disease between 2000 and 2010 at our institution were included. The primary outcome was pouch failure, defined as permanent ostomy diversion or pouch excision. RESULTS: Of 417 total patients, 28 (6.7%) patients developed pouch failure. Pouch failure was associated with female gender, anastomotic leak, Crohn's disease of the pouch and preoperative Clostridium difficile colitis. The use of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha biologics was not associated with pouch failure. Notably, 14.9% of patients were diagnosed with preoperative C. difficile colitis, a factor independently associated with pouch failure (hazard ratio 3.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-7.44; P = 0.016). C. difficile colitis did not contribute to failure by increasing the incidence of anastomotic leak but was associated with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease of the pouch (adjusted hazard ratio 2.27 [1.08-4.79]; P = 0.031). Anastomotic leak (P < 0.001) and pelvic abscess requiring drainage (P = 0.031) were other independent risk factors for pouch failure. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to previously known risk factors, history of preoperative C. difficile colitis was associated with pouch failure after reconstruction, suggesting the need for further study into the role of the gut-associated microbiome in pouch outcomes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interaction between TL1A and death receptor 3 (DR3) is associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), although their role in the development of this disease remains not fully explained. Some studies showed elevated expression of TL1A and DR3 in inflamed intestinal tissue but currently there are no reports concerning expression of DR3 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of IBD patients which was the subject of our study. METHODS: We performed flow cytometry analysis of DR3 expression on CD4(+), CD8(+), CD11c(+), CD14(+) or CD20(+) PBMCs of adults and children with IBD and healthy volunteers with respect to C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in blood. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients before the beginning of therapy, whereas adults patients were undergoing anti-inflammatory IBD treatment and had much lower CRP levels. RESULTS: With regard to appropriate healthy volunteers, children with IBD had elevated percentage of DR3-expressing CD4(+), CD8(+), CD11c(+) and CD20(+) PBMCs which, with the exception of DR3(+) CD11c(+) cells in children with ulcerative colitis, was correlated with CRP level in blood. Adult patients had increased frequency of DR3(+) CD8(+) and CD20(+) PBMCs and their CRP levels correlated only with DR3(+) CD8(+) cells. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to healthy volunteers, untreated children with IBD have higher percentage of DR3(+) PBMCs than adults with IBD undergoing anti-inflammatory treatment. In most of the investigated PBMCs populations, the frequency of DR3(+) cells is correlated with the level of CRP. We suggest anti-inflammatory treatment may lead to reduction in the frequency of DR3(+) PBMCs. (c) 2016 International Clinical Cytometry Society.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intestinal fibrosis is mainly associated with Crohn's disease and is defined as a progressive and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components. No specific antifibrotic therapies are available. In this study, we evaluate the antifibrotic effect of a novel 5-ASA analog able to activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, named GED-0507-34 Levo. METHODS: Colonic fibrosis was induced in 110 C57BL/6 mice by 3 cycles of 2.5% (wt/vol) dextran sulfate sodium administration for 6 weeks. The preventive effects of oral daily GED (30 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1)) administration were evaluated using a macroscopic and histological score and also through biological endpoints. Expression of main markers of myofibroblasts activation was determined in transforming growth factor (TGF-beta)-stimulated intestinal fibroblasts and epithelial cells. RESULTS: GED improved macroscopic and microscopic intestinal lesions in dextran sulfate sodium-treated animals and reduced the profibrotic gene expression of Acta2, COL1a1, and Fn1 by 1.48-folds (P < 0.05), 1.93-folds (P < 0.005), and 1.03-fold (P < 0.05), respectively. It reduced protein levels of main markers of fibrosis (alpha-SMA and Collagen I-II) and the main TGF-beta/Smad pathway components. GED also decreased the interleukin-13 and connective tissue growth factor expression by 1.89-folds (P < 0.05) and 2.2-folds (P < 0.005), respectively. GED inhibited TGF-beta-induced activation of both fibroblast and intestinal epithelial cell lines, by regulating mRNA expression of alpha-SMA and fibronectin, and restoring the TGF-beta-induced loss of intestinal epithelial cell markers. GED treatment also reduced the TGF-beta and ACTA1 expression in primary human intestinal fibroblasts from ulcerative colitis patients. CONCLUSIONS: GED ameliorates intestinal fibrosis in dextran sulfate sodium-induced chronic colitis in mice and regulates major profibrotic cellular and molecular mechanisms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cutaneous manifestations are common in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) (ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]). Previous case reports described patients with IBD who developed rosacea. IBD and rosacea are inflammatory epithelial diseases, presumably associated with changes in the innate immune system. We explored the association between IBD and incident rosacea. METHODS: We conducted a population-based matched (1:1) case-control analysis on the association between IBD and rosacea, stratified by IBD disease duration and severity. We used data from the UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Cases had an incident diagnosis of rosacea recorded between 1995 and 2013. RESULTS: Among 80,957 rosacea cases and the same number of controls, a history of UC was associated with an increased risk of rosacea (odds ratio [OR] 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-1.90), with the highest OR in those with short UC duration (OR 2.85, 95% confidence interval, 1.80-4.50 for patients with <2 years of disease history). A history of CD yielded an overall OR of 1.49 (95% CI, 1.25-1.77), which did not correlate with disease duration. Additional analyses on IBD disease severity yielded evidence for a higher risk of rosacea in those with higher UC and CD activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that patients with IBD may be at increased risk of rosacea (higher in UC), particularly during phases of increased IBD-associated gastrointestinal tract inflammation.},

The software is gathering details about patients' diet and associated fettle in order to estimate fettle change after future meals, specifically for an individual patient. In this paper we have described the process of idea development and application design, feasibility assessment using a phone survey, a preliminary evaluation on 6 healthy individuals and early results of a clinical trial, which is still an ongoing study. Results suggest that applied approximative approach (Shepard's method of 6-dimensional metric interpolation) has a potential to predict the fettle accurately; as shown in leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).},

   abstract = {The healthy human intestine is colonized by as many as 1014 bacteria belonging to more than 500 different species forming a microbial ecosystem of unsurpassed diversity, termed the microbiota. The microbiota's various bacterial members engage in a physiological network of cooperation and competition within several layers of complexity. Within the last 10 years, technological progress in the field of next-generation sequencing technologies has tremendously advanced our understanding of the wide variety of physiological and pathological processes that are influenced by the commensal microbiota (1, 2). An increasing number of human disease conditions, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), type 2 diabetes, obesity, allergies and colorectal cancer are linked with altered microbiota composition (3). Moreover, a clearer picture is emerging of the composition of the human microbiota in healthy individuals, its variability over time and between different persons and how the microbiota is shaped by environmental factors (i.e., diet) and the host's genetic background (4). A general feature of a normal, healthy gut microbiota can generate conditions in the gut that disfavor colonization of enteric pathogens. This is termed colonization-resistance (CR). Upon disturbance of the microbiota, CR can be transiently disrupted, and pathogens can gain the opportunity to grow to high levels. This disruption can be caused by exposure to antibiotics (5, 6), changes in diet (7, 8), application of probiotics and drugs (9), and a variety of diseases (3). Breakdown of CR can boost colonization by intrinsic pathogens or increase susceptibility to infections (10). One consequence of pathogen expansion is the triggering of inflammatory host responses and pathogen-mediated disease. Interestingly, human enteric pathogens are part of a small group of bacterial families that belong to the Proteobacteria: the Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, Yersinia spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp.), the Vibrionaceae (Vibrio cholerae) and the Campylobacteriaceae (Campylobacter spp.). In general, members of these families (be it commensals or pathogens) only constitute a minority of the intestinal microbiota. However, proteobacterial "blooms" are a characteristic trait of an abnormal microbiota such as in the course of antibiotic therapy, dietary changes or inflammation (11). It has become clear that the gut microbiota not only plays a major role in priming and regulating mucosal and systemic immunity, but that the immune system also contributes to host control over microbiota composition. These two ways of mutual communication between the microbiota and the immune system were coined as "outside-in" and "inside-out," respectively (12). The significance of those interactions for human health is particularly evident in Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). The symptoms of these recurrent, chronic types of gut inflammation are caused by an excessive immune response against one's own commensal microbiota (13). It is assumed that deregulated immune responses can be caused by a genetic predisposition, leading to, for example, the impairment of intestinal barrier function or disruption of mucosal T-cell homeostasis. In CD or UC patients, an abnormally composed microbiota, referred to as "dysbiosis," is commonly observed (discussed later). This is often characterized by an increased relative abundance of facultative anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Enterobacteriaeceae, Bacilli) and, at the same time, depletion of obligate anaerobic bacteria of the classes Bacteroidia and Clostridia. So far, it is unclear whether dysbiosis is a cause or a consequence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In fact, both scenarios are equally conceivable. Recent work suggests that inflammatory immune responses in the gut (both IBD and pathogen-induced) can alter the gut luminal milieu in a way that favors dysbiosis (14). In this chapter, I present a survey on our current state of understanding of the characteristics and mechanisms underlying gut inflammation-associated dysbiosis. The role of dysbiosis in enteric infections and human IBD is discussed. In addition, I will focus on competition of enteric pathogens and the gut microbiota in the inflamed gut and the role of dysbiotic microbiota alterations (e.g., "Enterobacterial blooms" (11)) for the evolution of pathogenicity.},

Why these associations are observed remains unclear. We assessed the impact of geographic location, season, and exposure to ultraviolet light on disease severity by measuring national hospital IBD-related discharge rates. METHODS: Utilizing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), we identified all patients with IBD-related discharges from 2001-2007. Patients were included if they were discharged from states above the 40th parallel (north) or at or below the 35th parallel (south); and their discharge fell within the winter (January, February, and March) or summer (July, August, and September). Groups of patients were assessed comparing north to south within each season, and summer to winter within each region. UV index was recorded from the National Weather Service data and compared to monthly discharge rates. RESULTS: There was a consistent pattern of increased IBD-related hospitalization rates in northern states compared to southern states for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Differences in IBD-related hospitalization rates by season, however, were not uniform across the years studied. UV index was significantly inversely associated although not proportional to discharge rates for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: In the US, there is a significant increased rate of IBD-related hospitalizations in the northern compared to southern states, which not fully explained by differences in UV exposure.},

   abstract = {Variation in clinical evidence has prevented the adoption of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the efficacy and safety of FMT in UC.A systematic literature search was performed in 5 electronic databases from inception through September 2015. Inclusion criteria were reports of FMT in patients with UC. Studies were excluded if they did not report clinical outcomes or included patients with infections. Clinical remission (CR) was defined as the primary outcome.Eleven studies (2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 open-label case-control study, and 8 cohort studies) with a total of 133 UC patients were included in the analysis. In 11 studies (including 8 noncontrol cohort studies and the treatment arms of 3 clinical control trials), the pooled proportion of patients who achieved CR was 30.4% (95% CI 22.6-39.4%), with a low risk of heterogeneity (Cochran Q test, P = 0.139; I = 33%). A subgroup analysis suggested that no difference in CR was detected between upper gastrointestinal delivery versus lower gastrointestinal delivery. Furthermore, subgroup analysis revealed that there was no difference in CR between single infusion versus multiple infusions (>1) of FMT. All studies reported mild adverse events.FMT is potentially useful in UC disease management but better-designed RCTs are still required to confirm our findings before wide adoption of FMT is suggested. Additionally, basic guidelines are needed imminently to identify the right patient population and to standardize the process of FMT.},

   abstract = {Recently, numerous studies have shown that disruption of the mucus barrier plays an important role in the exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly in ulcerative colitis. Alterations in the mucus barrier are well supported by published data and are widely accepted. The use of fluorescence in situ hybridization and Carnoy's fixation has revealed the importance of the mucus barrier in maintaining a mutualistic relationship between host and bacteria. Studies have raised the possibility that modulation of the mucus barrier may provide therapies for the disease, using agents such as short-chain fatty acids, prebiotics and probiotics. This review describes changes in the mucus barrier of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in animal models of the disease. We also review the involvement of the mucus barrier in the exacerbation of the disease and explore the therapeutic potential of modifying the mucus barrier with short-chain fatty acids, prebiotics, probiotics, fatty acid synthase, H(2)S, neutrophil elastase inhibitor and phophatidyl choline.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory disease of the large intestine, is characterized by a dysregulated immune reaction. UC is associated with fecal dysbiosis. Human and animal studies support the fact that the gastrointestinal microbiome may trigger the intestinal immune response, resulting in UC. Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT), by changing the gastrointestinal microbiome of patients with UC, may be a therapeutic option. METHODS: Four patients with moderate symptoms defined by the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index were enrolled in a prospective, open-label study of FMT via nasogastric tube in pediatric UC (US Food and Drug Administration IND 14942). After the donor and patient evaluation, patients received FMT with follow-up evaluations at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after transplantation. Study subjects were maintained on their pretransplant medications. The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index score, C-reactive protein, and stool calprotectin were completed during each study visit. RESULTS: Four patients with UC were enrolled (all boys). Ages ranged from 13 to 16 years. Patients tolerated FMT without adverse effects. None of the patients clinically improved with FMT, nor were there any significant changes in stool calprotectin or laboratory values, including C-reactive protein, albumin, and hematocrit. Three individuals received additional standard medical therapies before the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: This study, although showing that single-dose FMT via nasogastric tube is well tolerated in active pediatric UC, did not show any clinical or laboratory benefit.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that dietary therapy may be effective for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but limited published data exist on the usage and efficacy of dietary therapy. AIM: To evaluate the perspective of IBD patients using the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD). METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted using REDCap, a Web-based survey tool. Survey links were sent to known Web sites as well as support groups in an attempt to characterize patient utilization of the SCD and perception of efficacy of the SCD. RESULTS: There were 417 respondents of the online survey on the SCD with IBD. Mean age for individuals on the SCD was 34.9 +/- 16.4 years. Seventy percent were female. Forty-seven percent had Crohn's disease, 43 % had ulcerative colitis, and 10 % had indeterminate colitis. Individuals perceived clinical improvement on the SCD. Four percent reported clinical remission prior to the SCD, while 33 % reported remission at 2 months after initiation of the SCD, and 42 % at both 6 and 12 months. For those reporting clinical remission, 13 % reported time to achieve remission of less than 2 weeks, 17 % reported 2 weeks to a month, 36 % reported 1-3 months, and 34 % reported greater than 3 months. For individuals who reported reaching remission, 47 % of individuals reported associated improvement in abnormal laboratory values. CONCLUSIONS: The SCD is utilized by many patients as a primary and adjunct therapy for IBD. Most patients perceive clinical benefit to use of the SCD.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 24 patients newly diagnosed for IBD were included in the study: ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 13) and Crohn's disease (CD; n = 11). Seventeen healthy controls (HC) and 16 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) served as a control group for peripheral and intestinal Tregs assessment, respectively. The disease activity was assessed by Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI). Quantification of regulatory T cells of CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ phenotype in peripheral blood was based on three-color flow cytometry. Mucosal Tregs represented by FOXP3+ cells were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Median proportion of CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ cells among CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood (5.1%, range 1.7-84% vs. 4.3%, range 2-8.1%, p = 0.023) and median number of intestinal FOXP3+ cells (115.33 per high-power field, hpf, range 39.33-375.67 vs. 10.16 per hpf, range 5-30, p = 0.0001) were significantly higher in children with IBD than in the controls. The proportion of circulating Tregs and the number of intestinal FOXP3+ cells did not correlate with clinical activity of the disease, as well as with endoscopic and histopathologic scoring. No significant correlation was found between the percentage of peripheral CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ cells and the number of intestinal FOXP3+cells. CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBD likely do not present with a quantitative deficiency of circulating and intestinal Tregs at the moment of diagnosis.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of medical records of pediatric patients with moderate to severe UC who had received at least one infusion of infliximab in Polish pediatric academic clinical centers from 2003 to 2013. The primary endpoint was clinical remission rate at week 10, (PUCAI score <10 points) while the secondary endpoints were: clinical response rate (>19-points decrease in PUCAI), mucosal response rate (defined as an improvement of the Baron score), and mucosal healing rate (Baron score 0 or 1). RESULTS: 44 patients, at mean age of 14+/-3.9 years, were included into the study. 38 (86%) patients completed induction therapy regimen with infliximab and were finally included into the analysis. Clinical response and remission rates at week 10 there were 36% and 25% respectively. There was significant drop of PUCAI (58.31+/-15.5 vs. 24.23+/-23.83) and Baron score (2.63+/-0.49 vs. 1.44+/-0.99) at this time point. Mucosal response and mucosal healing rate were 57% and 48% respectively. Infliximab failure defined as non-clinical and non-mucosal response at week 10, occurred in 16 patients. Infliximab-associated adverse events occurred in 3 patients, with all severe hypersensitivity reactions to infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab induction therapy was safe and effective in Polish moderate to severe UC pediatric patients with 50% rate of mucosal improvement. However, clinical response rate was lower than previously reported.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic condition of the colon and small intestine. The disease is common in young people (children and young adults), but it is rare in children younger than five years of age. Therefore, IBD developing during the first years of life (under the age of 5) is known as an early-onset IBD (EO-IBD), and it is considered to be a specific entity with a distinct phenotype. However, the available data on that issue are still insufficient. AIM: To determine the characteristics and clinical course of children with early-onset IBD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective database analysis of 47 infants younger than 5 years old diagnosed with IBD. Patient's demographic data, including age, sex, and age at disease onset, were collected in 6 paediatric hospitals in Poland. Disease location was established on the basis of the review of all endoscopic, colonoscopic, histopathological, and radiological records. All possible complications were reported, as well as any treatment and its efficacy. Since the diagnosis was established all patients have been on follow up. RESULTS: Among 47 children registered in the database, 23 (49%) had a diagnosis of CD, 16 (34%) had UC, and 8 (17%) had IC (indeterminate colitis). The mean age at diagnosis was 28.5 +/-27.5 months; 57.4% were male. The most common location/type of disease was ileocolonic disease (L3). The most common complication of IBD was anaemia, found in 30 (63.8%) children. The observed course of the disease was either severe or moderate. In 4 children younger than 2 years old, surgery was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory bowel disease in children younger than 5 years old includes UC, CD, and a relatively high proportion of IC. In early-onset IBD severe and moderate course of the disease is usually observed. Disease manifestation in these patients is predominantly ileocolonic.},

Twenty-two hospitalized patients with CD and 18 patients with UC were enrolled in this study. We analyzed nutritional status upon admission by using nutritional screening tools including subjective global assessment, malnutrition universal screening tool, and laboratory tests. We measured resting energy expenditure (mREE) of the patients with indirect calorimetry and predicted resting energy expenditure (pREE) was calculated by using the Harris-Benedict equation. Results presented here indicate no significant difference in nutritional parameters and energy metabolism between CD and UC patients. In UC patients, a significant correlation was observed between mREE/body weight and disease activity detected by the Lichtiger and Seo indices. However, there was no correlation between mREE/body weight and Crohn's disease activity index in CD patients. Inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 levels correlated with mREE/pREE in CD and UC patients while tumor necrosis factor-alpha was not. In conclusion, energy expenditure significantly correlated with disease activity in UC patients but not in CD patients. These results indicate that establishing daily energy requirements based on disease activity of UC is imperative for improving the nutritional status of patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been considerable progress in identifying inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] susceptibility genes but little progress in examining the role of genetic variation in the development of the extra-intestinal manifestations [EIMs] of IBD. This study identified clinical, serological, and genetic factors associated with ocular EIMs [O-EIMs] in IBD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case-control study of IBD patients, comparing those with and without O-EIMs using the Cedars-Sinai IBD Research Repository and the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium Repository. Genotyping was performed using Illumina whole genome platforms. RESULTS: In all, 124 cases and 3328 controls with available clinical data were identified; 103 cases and 2808 controls had genetic data available. Erythema nodosum and peripheral arthritis particularly were common in patients with O-EIMs [p = 2.77 x 10(-13) and p = 2.58 x 10(-13), respectively] with increasing odds ratios for O-EIMs with each additional non-ocular-EIM [for >/= 2 EIMs, odds ratio 14.72]. Nominal association with O-EIMs was observed at several known IBD susceptibility single nuclear polymorphisms. One locus, containing RBM19, achieved genome-wide level of significance for association with O-EIMs. CONCLUSIONS: In IBD, O-EIMs co-occur with musculoskeletal and skin manifestations and, in this study, are nominally associated with known IBD loci. Additional cohorts are needed to verify these results and identify additional genes.},

   abstract = {The mucosal microbiota lives in close proximity with the intestinal epithelium and may interact more directly with the host immune system than the luminal/fecal bacteria. The availability of nutrients in the mucus layer of the epithelium is also very different from the gut lumen environment. Inferred metagenomic analysis for microbial function of the mucosal microbiota is possible by PICRUSt. We recently found that by using this approach, actively inflamed tissue of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients have mucosal communities enriched for genes involved in lipid and amino acid metabolism, and reduced for carbohydrate and nucleotide metabolism. Here, we find that the same bacterial taxa (e.g. Acinetobacter) and predicted microbial pathways enriched in actively inflamed colitis tissue are also enriched in the mucosa of subjects undergoing routine screening colonoscopies, when compared with paired samples of luminal/fecal bacteria. These results suggest that the mucosa of healthy individuals may be a reservoir of aerotolerant microbial communities expanded during colitis.},

Adequate sampling strategies are required to limit bias due to shifts in microbial communities during sampling and storage. Therefore, we examined the impact of different sampling and storage conditions on the stability of fecal microbial communities in healthy and diseased subjects. Fecal samples from 10 healthy controls, 10 irritable bowel syndrome and 8 inflammatory bowel disease patients were collected on site, aliquoted immediately after defecation and stored at -80 degrees C, -20 degrees C for 1 week, at +4 degrees C or room temperature for 24 hours. Fecal transport swabs (FecalSwab, Copan) were collected and stored for 48-72 hours at room temperature. We used pyrosequencing of the 16S gene to investigate the stability of microbial communities. Alpha diversity did not differ between all storage methods and -80 degrees C, except for the fecal swabs. UPGMA clustering and principal coordinate analysis showed significant clustering by test subject (p < 0.001) but not by storage method. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and (un)weighted UniFrac showed a significant higher distance between fecal swabs and -80 degrees C versus the other methods and -80 degrees C samples (p < 0.009). The relative abundance of Ruminococcus and Enterobacteriaceae did not differ between the storage methods versus -80 degrees C, but was higher in fecal swabs (p < 0.05). Storage up to 24 hours (at +4 degrees C or room temperature) or freezing at -20 degrees C did not significantly alter the fecal microbial community structure compared to direct freezing of samples from healthy subjects and patients with gastrointestinal disorders.},

Bone mass deficits are well described, little is known about other body composition compartments. AIMS: To define the alterations in non-bone tissue compartments in children with IBD, and explore the effects of demographic and disease parameters. METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in the PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) and Web of Science databases in May 2014 (limitations age <17 years, and composition measurements compared with a defined control population). RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in this systematic review, reporting on a total of 1479 children with IBD [1123 Crohn's disease, 243 ulcerative colitis], pooled mean age 13.1 +/- 3.2 years, and 34.9% female. Data were highly heterogeneous, in terms of methodology and patients. Deficits in protein-related compartments were reported. Lean mass deficits were documented in 93.6% of Crohn's disease and 47.7% of ulcerative colitis patients when compared with healthy control populations. Lower lean mass was common to both sexes in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, deficits in females with persisted for longer. Fat-related compartment findings were inconsistent, some studies report reductions in body fat in new diagnosis/active Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that almost all children with Crohn's disease and half with ulcerative colitis have reduced lean mass, however, body fat alterations are not well defined. To understand what impact this may have on health and disease in children with IBD, further studies are needed to identify in which tissues these deficits lie, and to quantify body fat and its distribution.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Thiopurines (azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine) have been used in the management of UC patients for over three decades. Nearly half of patients with UC treated with thiopurines fail to achieve remission or lose remission during treatment. Factors associated with thiopurine failure are poorly understood. The primary aim of our study was to investigate patient-related factors which are associated with thiopurine failure. METHODS: TNF-alpha antagonist-naive patients with histological diagnosis of UC, receiving thiopurine therapy, with follow-up data from 1 to 3 years were included in the study. Data regarding demographics, laboratory results, and disease characteristics were collected. The primary endpoint was failure of thiopurine therapy, defined as treatment with steroids, therapeutic escalation to TNF-alpha antagonist therapy, or need for surgery. RESULTS: Of the 563 patients identified using ICD-9 codes, 78 TNF-alpha antagonist-naive patients with a histological diagnosis of UC, receiving thiopurine treatment, were identified. Over the three-year follow-up period, 38 patients failed thiopurine treatment. On adjusted Cox regression, BMI < 25 kg/m(2) (HR 3, 95 % CI 1.55-5.83; p value = 0.001) was significantly associated with thiopurine failure. Furthermore, although not statistically significant, there was a strong trend toward thiopurine failure among patients with serum albumin level < 4 g/dL (HR 1.98, 95 % CI 0.97-4; p value = 0.06), non-smoking status (HR 2.2, 95 % CI 0.96-5.06; p value = 0.06), and higher degree of colon inflammation (HR 1.49, 95 % CI 0.96-2.32; p value = 0.08). DISCUSSION: Our results show that low body mass index is associated with increased risk of failure of thiopurine treatment. Furthermore, there was a strong trend toward thiopurine failure among patients with low serum albumin level (<4gm/dL). These factors should be considered as markers of non-response to thiopurine monotherapy for patients with moderately severe ulcerative colitis.},

Two presentations explored different aspects of probiotic intervention: the small intestine as a probiotic target and inclusion of probiotics into integrative approaches to gastroenterology. Probiotic recommendations in gastroenterology guidelines and current data on probiotic efficacy in paediatric patients were reviewed. Updates were given on probiotic and gut microbiota research in obesity and obesity-related diseases, the gut-brain axis and development of psychobiotics, and the protective effects of equol-producing strains for prostate cancer. Recent studies were presented on probiotic benefit for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and people with HIV, as well as protection against the adverse effects of a short-term high-fat diet. Aspects of probiotic mechanisms of activity were discussed, including immunomodulatory mechanisms and metabolite effects, the anti-inflammatory properties of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the relationship between periodontitis, microbial production of butyrate in the oral cavity and ageing, and the pathogenic mechanisms of Campylobacter. Finally, an insight was given on a recent expert meeting, which re-examined the probiotic definition, advised on the appropriate use and scope of the term and outlined different probiotic categories and the prevalence of different mechanisms of activity.},

   abstract = {Objective Basic and epidemiologic studies on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have suggested an association between vitamin D and IBD risk. Though, the literature on IBD - especially pediatric-onset IBD - and vitamin D is still in its cradle. We therefore wanted to examine if levels of 25(OH)D at birth were associated with increased risk of developing pediatric-onset IBD. Material and methods A case-cohort study composed of cases diagnosed with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or indeterminate/unclassified colitis and healthy controls. Cases and controls were matched on date of birth and were born in the period 1981-2004. Cases were diagnosed before the age of 18 years. The concentration of 25(OH)D was assessed from neonatal dried blood spots using a highly sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated using conditional logistic regression and two-way ANOVA were used to test for season and birth year 25(OH)D variations. A total of 384 matched pairs were included in the statistical analyses. Results No significant association were found between levels of 25(OH)D and IBD risk in the adjusted model (OR [95% CI] (per 25 nmol/L increase), 1.12 [0.88; 1.42], p = 0.35). 25(OH)D levels were found to fluctuate significantly with season (p < 0.001) and year (p < 0.001). Median/Q1-Q3 values for 25(OH)D were 27.1/16.5-39.5 nmol/L for cases and 25.7/16.1-39.4 nmol/L for controls. Conclusion Our study do not suggest that a window of vulnerability exist around time of birth in regards to 25(OH)D levels and later pediatric-onset IBD risk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microbiota refers to the population of microorganisms (bacteria, viruses and fungi) that inhabit the entire gastrointestinal tract, more particularly the colon whose role is to maintain the integrity of the intestinal mucosa and control the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria. Alteration in the composition of the gut microbiota is called dysbiosis. Dysbiosis redisposes to inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease and indeterminate colitis. METHODS: The purpose of this literature review is to elucidate the influence of diet on the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota in the healthy gut and the role of diet in the development of dysbiosis. CONCLUSION: The "Western diet", in particular a low - fiber high fat/high carbohydrate diet is one factor that can lead to severe dysbiosis. In contrast, "mediterranean" and vegetarian diets that includes abundant fruits, vegetables, olive oil and oily fish are known for their anti-inflammatory effects and could prevent dysbiosis and subsequent inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about the role of the microbiome in primary sclerosing cholangitis. AIM: To explore the mucosa-associated microbiota in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) patients across different locations in the gut, and to compare it with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-only patients and healthy controls. METHODS: Biopsies from the terminal ileum, right colon, and left colon were collected from patients and healthy controls undergoing colonoscopy. Microbiota profiling using bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing was performed on all biopsies. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were recruited: 20 with PSC (19 with PSC-IBD and one with PSC-only), 15 with IBD-only and nine healthy controls. The overall microbiome profile was similar throughout different locations in the gut. No differences in the global microbiome profile were found. However, we observed significant PSC-associated enrichment in Barnesiellaceae at the family level, and in Blautia and an unidentified Barnesiellaceae at the genus level. At the operational taxa unit level, most shifts in PSC were observed in Clostridiales and Bacteroidales orders, with approximately 86% of shifts occurring within the former order. CONCLUSIONS: The overall microbiota profile was similar across multiple locations in the gut from the same individual regardless of disease status. In this study, the mucosa associated-microbiota of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis was characterised by enrichment of Blautia and Barnesiellaceae and by major shifts in operational taxa units within Clostridiales order.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease with different described behaviors, including stricture. At present, there are no laboratory studies that can differentiate stricturing CD from other phenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease. We performed a pilot study to examine differences in the proteome among patients with stricturing CD, nonstricturing CD, and ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Serum samples were selected from the Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry, an established cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with CD with surgically resected stricture were matched with similar patients with CD without known stricture and with ulcerative colitis. Serum samples from each patient were digested and analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to characterize the proteome. Statistical analyses were performed to identify peptides and proteins that can differentiate CD with stricture. RESULTS: Samples from 9 patients in each group (27 total patients) were analyzed. Baseline demographic characteristics were similar among the 3 groups. We quantified 7668 peptides and 897 proteins for analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified a subset of peptides with an area under the curve greater than 0.9, indicating greater separation potential. Partial least squares discriminant analysis was able to distinguish among the three groups with up to 70% accuracy by peptides and up to 80% accuracy by proteins. We identified the significantly different proteins and peptides and determined their function based on previously published literature. CONCLUSIONS: The serum of patients with stricturing CD, nonstricturing CD, and ulcerative colitis is distinguishable through proteomic analysis. Some of the proteins that differentiate the stricturing phenotype have been implicated in complement activation, fibrinolytic pathways, and lymphocyte adhesion.},

   abstract = {Enteral nutrition (EN) is considered to be of great importance in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and nutritional problems. This comprehensive review is aiming to provide the reader with an update on the role of EN in IBD patients. EN can reduce Crohn's disease (CD) activity and maintain remission in both adults and children. Nutritional support using liquid formulas should be considered for CD patients and in serious cases of ulcerative colitis (UC), especially for those who may require prolonged cycles of corticosteroids. Given that the ultimate goal in the treatment of CD is mucosal healing, this advantage of EN over corticosteroid treatment is valuable in therapeutic decision-making. EN is indicated in active CD, in cases of steroid intolerance, in patient's refusal of steroids, in combination with steroids in undernourished individuals, and in patients with an inflammatory stenosis of the small intestine. No differences between the efficiency of elemental diets and nonelemental formulas have been noticed. EN must be the first choice compared to TPN. EN has a restricted value in the treatment of patients with large bowel CD. In conclusion, it seems important not to underestimate the role of nutrition as supportive care in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic gastrointestinal disorder, is a debilitating disease affecting many people across the globe. Research suggests that the levels of several antioxidants, including beta-carotene (beta-CAR), decrease in the serum of patients with UC. The present study was aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in beta-CAR-mediated protection against UC in mice. METHODS: UC was induced in mice using 3%w/v dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water for two cycles; one cycle comprised of 7 days of dextran sulfate sodium-treated water followed by 14 days of normal drinking water. beta-CAR was administered at the doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg bw/day, po throughout the experiment. The effect of beta-CAR in mice with UC was evaluated using biochemical parameters, histological evaluation, comet and micronucleus assays, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: The results indicated that beta-CAR treatment ameliorated the severity of UC by modulating various molecular targets such as nuclear factor-kappa B, cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin 17, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and connective tissue growth factor. Further, beta-CAR treatment maintained the gut integrity by increasing the expression of a tight junction protein, occludin, which was decreased in the colon of mice with UC. Also beta-CAR treatment significantly reduced UC-associated elevated plasma lipopolysaccharide level, systemic inflammation and genotoxicity. CONCLUSION: beta-CAR ameliorated UC-associated local and systemic damage in mice by acting on multiple targets.},

   abstract = {The mucosal immune system (including airway, intestinal, oral and cervical epithelium) is an integrated network of tissues, cells and effector molecules that protect the host from environmental insults and infections at mucous membrane surfaces. Dysregulation of immunity at mucosal surfaces is thought to be responsible for the alarming global increase in mucosal inflammatory diseases such as those affecting the gastrointestinal (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome) and respiratory (asthma, allergy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder) system. Although immune regulation has been well-studied in isolated mucosal sites, the extent of the immune interaction between anatomically distant mucosal sites has been mostly circumstantial and the focus of much debate. With novel technology and more precise tools to examine histological and functional changes in tissues, today there is increased appreciation of the 'common mucosal immunological system' originally proposed by Bienenstock nearly 40 years ago. Evidence is amounting which shows that stimulation of one mucosal compartment can directly and significantly impact distant mucosal site, however the mechanisms are unknown. Today, we are only beginning to understand the complexity of relationships and communications that exist between different mucosal compartments. A holistic approach to studying the mucosal immune system as an integrated global organ is imperative for future advances in understanding mucosal immunology and for future treatment of chronic diseases. In this review, we particularly focus on the latest evidence and the mechanisms operational in driving the lung-gut cross-talk.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Data suggest physicians poorly assess disease-specific literacy and transition readiness in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We piloted an electronic, interactive iPad quiz game that could be used in a clinical setting, with the aims of measuring IBD-related knowledge, and concomitant mood and quality of life (QOL) in a pediatric population. METHODS: Two pediatric IBD clinics developed and tested 2 versions of "Emma." Patients between 10 and 18 years of age played Emma during an office visit. Each patient answered 12 randomly selected disease-related questions and 4 mood-related questions. RESULTS: Sites 1 and 2 tested Emma v1 between May and August 2013. Emma v2 was tested from November 2013 to January 2014 and from September 2013 to January 2014. A total of 56 patients played Emma v1, whereas 60 played Emma v2. In Emma v2, 73.1% of questions were answered correctly. Patients recognized signs of IBD (88%), causes of diarrhea in addition to IBD (79.4%), and could define lactose intolerance (95.8%), but fewer patients understood serological testing used for disease monitoring (68%) or knew that magnetic resonance enterography did not involve radiation (22.9%). Patients tended to report good functioning in the areas of energy, mood, anxiety, and school-related QOL. Patients with Crohn disease, however, reported higher stress levels compared with patients with ulcerative colitis; older patients reported lower energy levels, and postsurgical patients reported lower QOL. CONCLUSIONS: The Emma iPad game has the potential to evaluate gaps in IBD knowledge, assess emotional functioning, and increase patient engagement as a transition tool in the clinical setting.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trials in adults suggested that, in ulcerative colitis [UC], once-daily [OD] dosing of 5-ASA [5-amino salicylic acid] may be as or more effective than twice-daily [BD] dosing. In this induction of remission, investigator-blinded, randomised controlled-trial, we aimed to compare effectiveness and safety of once- versus twice-daily mesalazine in paediatric UC. METHODS: Children, aged 4-18 years with a PUCAI [Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index] of 10-55 points at inclusion, were randomised in blocks of six with blinded allocation to OD or BD mesalazine, using a weight-based dosing table. The primary outcome was mean PUCAI score at Week 6. RESULTS: A total of 83/86 randomised children were eligible and analysed: 43 in the OD group and 40 in the BD group (mean age 14 +/- 2.7 years, 43 [52%] males, 51 [62%] extensive colitis). The groups did not differ with regard to disease activity or any other parameter at baseline. There was no difference in median PUCAI score between the OD group and BD group at Week 6: 15 ( interquartile range [IQR] 5-40) versus 10 [0-40]; p = 0.48]. Response was seen in 25 [60%] OD versus 25 [63%] BD dosing [p = 0.78]. Proportion of children in remission [PUCAI < 10] at Week 6 was 13 [30%] OD versus 16 [40%] BD; p = 0.35]. Most adverse events were related to disease aggravation; the rates of serious adverse events were similar [p > 0.2]. CONCLUSIONS: In this first randomised controlled trial in children, no differences were found between OD and BD dosing for any clinical outcome. Remission was achieved in 35% of children treated with mesalazine for active UC.},

Ulcerative colitis mostly affect non- or ex-smokers; smoking may improve the course of the disease. OBJECTIVES: Systematic literature review of data on the relationship between smoking, smoking cessation and Crohn'disease. DOCUMENTARY SOURCES: Medline, on the period 1980-2015 with the keywords "Crohn's disease" or "inflammatory bowel disease" and "smoking" or "smoking cessation"; limits "Title/Abstract"; the selected languages were English or French. STUDY SELECTION: Among 1315 articles, 168 abstracts have given rise to a dual reading to select 69 studies (case-control, retrospective, reviews or meta-analysis). Data were extracted using a reading gate. RESULTS: Smoking increases the risk of complications, recurrences and resort of surgery, corticosteroids or immunosuppressants. These deleterious effects are more common in women. Stopping smoking improves the course of the disease and represents an essential component of its management. LIMITS: Heterogeneity of the studies collected according to the type, population characteristics, definition of smoking status and the validation of smoking cessation. CONCLUSION: Smokers suffering from CD must routinely be made aware of the disadvantages of smoking, benefits of abstinence and helped to quit smoking.},

Mucosal inflammation, due to altered microbiota, increased intestinal permeability and immune system dysfunction underlies the symptoms and may be caused in susceptible individuals by different factors (or a combination of them), including dietary habits and components. In this review we describe the influence of the Western diet, obesity, and different nutraceuticals/functional foods (bioactive peptides, phytochemicals, omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D, probiotics and prebiotics) on the course of IBD, and provide some hints that could be useful for nutritional guidance. Hopefully, research will soon offer enough reliable data to slow down the spread of the disease and to make diet a cornerstone in IBD therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aims of the study were to determine the incidence rate of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) and its trends for the period of 2002-2010 and to assess the geographical distribution of PIBD in Slovenia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients (0-18 years) with newly diagnosed IBD during the study period were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The mean incidence rate for IBD in 2002-2010 was 7.6 per 100,000 children and adolescents per year, 4.5 for Crohn's disease (CD), 2.9 for ulcerative colitis (UC), and 0.2 for IBD-unclassified, respectively. The incidence rate increased from 5.8 per 100,000 per year in 2002-2004 to 8.6 in 2005-2007 and remained stable afterwards. Statistically significant difference in the incidence rate between the Northeastern and Southwestern parts of the country was observed (p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: This nationwide study demonstrates that Slovenia is among the European countries with the highest PIBD incidence. During the study period a substantial rise of PIBD incidence was observed during the first half of the study and it seems to have stabilized in the second half. The significant difference in PIBD incidence between Northeastern and Southwestern parts of the country merits further exploration of the possible environmental factors.},

   abstract = {Early cancer detection currently relies on screening the entire at-risk population, as with colonoscopy and mammography. Therefore, frequent, invasive surveillance of patients at risk for developing cancer carries financial, physical, and emotional burdens because clinicians lack tools to accurately predict which patients will actually progress into malignancy. Here, we present a new method to predict cancer progression risk via nanoscale nuclear architecture mapping (nanoNAM) of unstained tissue sections based on the intrinsic density alteration of nuclear structure rather than the amount of stain uptake. We demonstrate that nanoNAM detects a gradual increase in the density alteration of nuclear architecture during malignant transformation in animal models of colon carcinogenesis and in human patients with ulcerative colitis, even in tissue that appears histologically normal according to pathologists. We evaluated the ability of nanoNAM to predict "future" cancer progression in patients with ulcerative colitis who did and did not develop colon cancer up to 13 years after their initial colonoscopy. NanoNAM of the initial biopsies correctly classified 12 of 15 patients who eventually developed colon cancer and 15 of 18 who did not, with an overall accuracy of 85%. Taken together, our findings demonstrate great potential for nanoNAM in predicting cancer progression risk and suggest that further validation in a multicenter study with larger cohorts may eventually advance this method to become a routine clinical test.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Autoimmune cytopenias (AIC) including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and immunologic thrombocytopenia (ITP) are rare immunologic disorders, scarcely reported in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We conducted a multicentric retrospective study, including a case-control analysis, that aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients affected by AIC and IBD. METHOD: Forty cases were recruited from 4 IBD centers and 2 AIC tertiary centers. Controls were recruited from the MICISTA registry. RESULTS: From the MICISTA registry, incidences were estimated at 4.1/100,000 patient-years and 12.5/100,000 patient-years after IBD diagnosis for AIHA and ITP, respectively. All AIHA patients (n=14) had colonic involvement (13/14 with UC), whereas CD (52%) and UC (48%) diagnoses were evenly distributed among ITP patients. Compared to control IBD patients, cases were characterized by a higher frequency of extra-intestinal manifestations (37.5% vs 17%, p<0.001) and by the presence of IBD severity's hallmark. AIHA and IBD ran mainly in parallel, and 12 out of 14 AIHA were warm AIHA. In isolated cases, rituximab and infliximab were efficient to treat IBD and AIC, respectively. IBD surgery may induce AIC remission in some cases. CONCLUSION: Although low, incidence of AIC appears higher in IBD patients compared to the general population. The association seems to be mainly non-fortuitous, especially for colitis-associated AIHA.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), known collectively as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), are chronic immunoinflammatory pathologies of unknown aetiology. Despite the frequent use of biomarkers in medical practice, there is a relative lack of information regarding validated paediatric biomarkers for IBD. Furthermore, biomarkers proved to be efficacious in adults are frequently extrapolated to the paediatric clinical setting without considering that the pathogenesis of many diseases is distinctly different in children. In the present study, proteomics technology was used to monitor differences in protein expression among adult and young patients with CD, identify a panel of candidate protein biomarkers that may be used to improve prognostic-diagnostic accuracy, and advance paediatric medical care. METHODS: Male and female serum samples from 12 adults and 12 children with active CD were subjected to 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Following the relative quantitation of protein spots exhibiting a differential expression between the 2 groups by densitometry, the spots were further characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The results were confirmed by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Clusterin was found to be significantly overexpressed in adults with CD, whereas ceruloplasmin and apolipoprotein B-100 were found to be significantly overexpressed in children, indicating that the expression of these proteins may be implicated in the onset or progression of CD in these 2 subgroups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Interestingly, we found a differential expression of several proteins in adults versus paediatric patients with CD. Undoubtedly, future experiments using a larger cohort of patients with CD are needed to evaluate the relevance of our preliminary findings.},

We undertook to describe the development and associations of abnormal LEs in pediatric IBD. METHODS: We ascertained a cohort of 300 children with IBD and collected retrospective data. A Kaplan-Meier analysis determined the time to development of different thresholds of abnormal LEs. Associations between clinical variables and the development of abnormal LEs were determined. RESULTS: The probability of developing the first episode of abnormal LEs above the upper limit of normal (ULN) within 150 months was 58.1% (16.3% by 1 mo post-IBD diagnosis). There was a 6% prevalence of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC) in this cohort. Of those diagnosed with PSC/ASC, 93% had persistent LE elevations at a threshold of >2x ULN, while those without PSC/ASC had a 4% probability of this abnormality. Elevated gamma glutamyltranspeptidase levels of 252 U/L had a 99% sensitivity and 71% specificity for PSC/ASC in IBD. After exclusion of patients with PSC/ASC, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and exclusive enteral nutrition demonstrated strongly positive associations with the first development of abnormal LEs >ULN (hazard ratio 2.1 [95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.3], hazard ratio 5.6 [95% confidence interval, 3.6-8.9], hazard ratio 4.2 [95% confidence interval, 1.6-11.3], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal LEs are common in pediatric IBD and occur early. PSC/ASC is associated with persistently high LEs and gamma glutamyltranspeptidase levels >252 U/L. Children with IBD are at risk of elevated LEs if they require medications other than 5-ASA to induce IBD remission.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Data regarding pediatric primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) natural history are limited. We describe a large pediatric PSC cohort with longitudinal follow-up. METHODS: The present study records review of pediatric patients with PSC diagnosed between 1984 and 2014. RESULTS: N = 120 (63% M) ages 1 to 21 years (median 14 years) at diagnosis. 27% (31/113) had autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC), 24% had exclusive small duct PSC, METAVIR stage was F3-F4 in 41%. Eighty-one percent of patients with PSC had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); most had ulcerative/indeterminate colitis (72/97), typically pancolitis (40/72). PSC-IBD was more common than ASC-IBD (85% vs 68%, P = 0.03). Median follow-up was 3.7 years (interquartile range [IQR] 1.5, 6.9). Median gamma glutamyl transferase decreased from baseline of 221 U/L (IQR 110, 425) to 104 U/L by 1 year postdiagnosis ([IQR 18,229], P < 0.0001), and then changed little. Mean fibrosis stage at diagnosis was 2.3 +/- 1.4 (N = 91), and at 1 to 5 years was 2.6 +/- 1.3 (N = 20). Transplant-free survival at 10 year was 89%; there were 6 liver transplants, 2 in patients with small duct PSC and 4 with diffuse large duct PSC. Although the cirrhosis rate was not significantly different in PSC with IBD versus without (22% vs 41%, P = 0.06), the former had a lower rate of liver transplantation (2% vs 18%, P = 0.01). The rate of cirrhosis was lower in patients diagnosed with IBD before PSC (15% vs 31%, P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this largest reported pediatric PSC cohort, liver transplantation rate at 10 years was lower than that reported in adults. ASC and PSC had similar biochemical abnormalities and degree of fibrosis at diagnosis. PSC that developed after IBD diagnosis had a milder course, possibly reflecting earlier disease detection or milder phenotype.},

   abstract = {The management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has changed since the mid-1990s (e.g., use of thiopurines/anti-TNFalpha agents, improved surveillance programs), possibly affecting cancer risk. To establish current cancer risk in IBD, updates are warranted from cohorts covering this time span, and detailed enough to study associations with phenotype and medication. We studied intestinal-, extra-intestinal- and overall cancer risk in the Dutch population-based IBDSL cohort. In total, 1,157 Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,644 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were diagnosed between 1991 and 2011, and followed until 2013. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for CD and UC separately, as well as for gender-, phenotype-, disease duration-, diagnosis era- and medication groups. We found an increased risk for colorectal cancer in CD patients with colon involvement (SIR 2.97; 95% CI 1.08-6.46), but not in the total CD or UC population. In addition, CD patients were at increased risk for hematologic- (2.41; 1.04-4.76), overall skin- (1.55; 1.06-2.19), skin squamous cell- (SCC; 3.83; 1.83-7.04) and overall cancer (1.28; 1.01-1.60), whereas UC patients had no increased risk for extra-intestinal- and overall cancer. Finally, in a medication analysis on CD and UC together, long-term immunosuppression exposure (>12 months) was associated with an increased risk for hematologic cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, SCC and overall cancer, and this increase was mainly attributed to thiopurines. IBD patients with long-term immunosuppression exposure can be considered as having a higher cancer risk, and our data support the advice in recent IBD guidelines to consider skin cancer screening in these patients.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are multifactorial, relapsing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. However, the etiology is still poorly understood but involves altered immune responses, epithelial dysfunction, environmental factors, and nutrition. Recently, we have shown that the diet supplement corabion has cardioprotective effects due to reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation. Since oxidative stress and inflammation are also prominent risk factors in IBD, we speculated that corabion also has beneficial effects on experimental colitis. Colitis was induced in male mice by administration of 3.5% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for a period of 3 or 7 days with or without daily gavage feeding of corabion consisting of vitamin C, vitamin E, L-arginine, and eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid. We found that corabion administration attenuated DSS-induced colon shortening, tissue damage, and disease activity index during the onset of colitis. Mechanistically, these effects could be explained by reduced neutrophil recruitment, oxidative stress, production of proinflammatory cytokines, and internalization of the junctional proteins ZO-1 and E-cadherin leading to less edema formation. Thus, corabion may be a useful diet supplement for the management of chronic inflammatory intestinal disorders such as IBD.},

STUDY DESIGN: The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 689 families. Patients had 1 of 7 physician-diagnosed GI disorders: chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The healthy control sample included 1114 families. School days missed, days in bed and needing care, parent missed workdays, work impact, and healthcare utilization were compared as well. RESULTS: Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease demonstrated lower HRQOL than the healthy controls across all dimensions (physical, emotional, social, and school; P < .001 for all), with larger effect sizes for patients with an FGID. Patients with an FGID manifested lower HRQOL than those with an organic GI disease. Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease missed more school, spent more days in bed and needing care, had greater healthcare utilization, and had parents who missed more workdays with greater work impact (P < .001 for most), with larger effect sizes for the patients with an FGID. CONCLUSION: Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease demonstrate impaired HRQOL compared with healthy children. HRQOL can be used as a common metric to compare patient outcomes in clinical research and practice both within and across groups of patients with FGIDs and organic GI diseases.},

The primary study objectives were to compare the gastrointestinal symptoms and worry of pediatric patients with IBD with matched healthy controls and to compare Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with each other using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. METHODS: PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 256 pediatric patients with IBD and 259 parents of patients (263 families; Crohn's disease [n = 195], ulcerative colitis [n = 68]). Ten Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea were administered along with 2 Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. A matched group of 384 healthy children families completed the PedsQL in an Internet survey. RESULTS: PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales distinguished between pediatric patients with IBD in comparison with healthy controls (P < 0.001), with larger effect sizes for symptoms indicative of IBD, supporting known-groups validity and clinical interpretability including minimal important difference scores. Patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis did not demonstrate significantly different gastrointestinal symptoms or worry in comparison with each other. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales may be used as common metrics across pediatric patients with IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis separately to measure gastrointestinal-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) and markers of vitamin D status in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of 59 pediatric patients with IBD (age 16.4 +/- 2.2 y) and 116 controls (age 14.6 +/- 4.4 y), to investigate the association between 25(OH)D and albuminemia for protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) and hepatic dysfunction; alanine transaminase (ALT) for hepatic inflammation; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for intestinal inflammation; body mass index (BMI) for adiposity; seasons and skin pigmentation for insolation. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L; abnormal liver enzyme by ALT >40 U/L; overweight status by BMI of >/=85th but <95th percentile, and obesity by BMI >/=95th percentile. Seasons were categorized as summer, winter, spring, and fall. RESULTS: Patients with IBD had a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (42.4% versus 26.7%; P = 0.04), elevated ALT (16.9% versus 2.6%; P < 0.001), and lower albumin (41.1 +/- 4.8 versus 45.1 +/- 3.8; P < 0.001) than controls. In both the IBD cohort and controls, 25(OH)D was highest in summer and lowest in winter, and significantly higher in white than in non-white patients. ESR varied significantly with 25(OH)D (R(2) = 0.24; beta = -0.32; P = 0.010), and only patients with IBD with elevated ESR had lower 25(OH)D than controls (49.5 +/- 25.2 versus 65.3 +/- 28.0 nmol/L; P = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Intestinal inflammation, not the loss of albumin-bound vitamin D in the gut, is the primary intestinal determinant of vitamin D status in IBD. The extraintestinal determinants are seasons and skin pigmentation, but not adiposity and hepatic inflammation.},

Studies have shown that vitamin A (VA) reduces disease progression by promoting FOXP3(+) T cells and curbing Th17 cells. In this study, we explored the association of colonic IL-23R and FOXP3 expression in fifty-one UC patients (23 in remission and 28 with active disease) with serum VA levels and disease activity. We observed that decreased serum VA levels were associated with increased disease activity. However, there was no significant difference in mucosal IL-23R and FOXP3 expression in UC patients with moderate-to-severe disease activity compared to those in remission. Also, no significant correlation was drawn between serum VA levels and mucosal IL-23R and FOXP3 expression. Our study suggests that even after an established role of VA in inhibiting Th17 responses in mice models and humans, serum VA levels and disease activity do not correlate with FOXP3 and IL-23R expression in colonic mucosa of UC patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Treatment of acute severe colitis (ASC) has been associated with high morbidity and high colectomy rate in children. In the prebiologics era, our centre used short-term high-dose intravenous corticosteroids (IVCS) at 2 to 30 mg . kg . day. We conducted a retrospective review to compare efficacy of different dosing regimes of IVCS. METHODS: Thirty-four children treated with IVCS for ASC were included over 8 years. Patients were studied as 2 groups with similar pretreatment patient characteristics. Group 1 (standard dose) received IVCS at 2 mg . kg . day and group 2 (high dose) received IVCS at 10 to 30 mg . kg . day. Safety, efficacy, and follow-up of the entire cohort for >1 year were studied. The median IVCS dose in the standard- and high-dose cohort was 1.5 mg . kg . day (maximum 60 mg . kg . day) and 24.8 mg . kg . day (maximum 1000 mg . kg . day), respectively. RESULTS: Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index scores at day 5 were significantly lower in high-dose (15, interquartile range 8.5-20) than in standard-dose IVCS (30, interquartile range 20-30). IVCS side effects were minor and reversible. Overall, medical salvage therapy was required in 5.8% (2 children) before discharge, and in 17% (6 children) at follow-up after 1 year. The colectomy rate of the entire cohort was remarkably low with 0% during admission and 11% (4 children) after 1 year, with a trend of less colectomies in high-dose (4.8%-1 child) than in standard-dose (23%-3 children). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that in paediatric ASC, the short-term use of high-dose IVCS is safe and effective. Prospective studies are needed to define the role of IVCS within salvage therapy protocols.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIM: Although inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at risk for metabolic bone disease, studies analyzing this correlation have identified various risk factors, including disease phenotype, age, sex and steroid therapy. Furthermore, few studies have assessed risk factors for bone loss in Japanese IBD patients. This study analyzed risk factors for metabolic bone disease in Japanese IBD patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed 388 patients with IBD aged 20-50 years, including 232 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 156 with Crohn's disease (CD). Bone mineral density of the femoral neck, total femur and lumbar spine was quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The blood concentrations of bone metabolism markers were measured. History of smoking and bone fracture, and nutritional intake were assessed using questionnaires. RESULTS: Of the 388 patients with IBD, 78 (20.1%; UC, 17.2%; CD, 24.4%) had osteopenia and 17 (4.4%; UC, 3.4%; CD, 5.8%) had osteoporosis, as assessed by T-score. Bone mineral density of the lumbar vertebrae was lower in males than in females. Multivariate regression analysis showed that risk factors for bone loss in UC patients were male sex, low body mass index (BMI), high steroid dose and disease location. Risk factors for bone loss in CD patients were male sex and low BMI. CONCLUSION: Among Japanese patients with IBD, male sex and low BMI were associated with increased risk for metabolic bone disease. In addition, Steroid therapy shouldn't be indiscriminate in UC patients. These findings may help identify patients at particularly high risk of metabolic bone disease and may help implement appropriate therapies in a timely manner and improve long-term quality of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: IL-33, a member of the IL-1 cytokine family that signals through ST2, is upregulated in ulcerative colitis (UC); however, the role of IL-33 in colitis remains unclear. IL-33 augments type 2 immune responses, which have been implicated in UC pathogenesis. We sought to determine the role of IL-33 signaling in oxazolone (OXA) colitis, a type 2 cytokine-mediated murine model of UC. METHODS: Colon mucosal IL-33 expression was compared between pediatric and adult UC and non-IBD patients using immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. OXA colitis was induced in WT, IL-33, and ST2 mice, and histopathology, cytokine levels, and goblet cells were assessed. Transepithelial resistance was measured across IL-33-treated T84 cell monolayers. RESULTS: Colon mucosal IL-33 was increased in pediatric patients with active UC and in OXA colitis. IL-33 and ST2 OXA mice exhibited increased disease severity compared with WT OXA mice. OXA induced a mixed mucosal cytokine response, but few differences were observed between OXA WT and IL-33 or ST2 mice. Goblet cells were significantly decreased in IL-33 and ST2 OXA compared with WT OXA mice. IL-33 augmented transepithelial resistance in T84 cells, and this effect was blocked by the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98,059. CONCLUSIONS: OXA colitis is exacerbated in IL-33 and ST2 mice. Increased mucosal IL-33 in human UC and murine colitis may be a homeostatic response to limit inflammation, potentially through effects on epithelial barrier function. Further investigation of IL-33 protective mechanisms would inform the development of novel therapeutic approaches.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Colonoscopy with biopsy sampling is often performed to detect collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) in patients with chronic non-bloody diarrhea. However, the diagnostic yield is low and incurs high costs. Fecal calprotectin (FC) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) indicate intestinal inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). In CC, elevated fecal levels of eosinophil protein X (EPX) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) have been reported. We aimed to evaluate if F-EPX, F-ECP, FC, and F-MPO could predict the diagnostic outcome in patients with chronic non-bloody diarrhea referred to colonoscopy. We also evaluated serum (S) EPX and ECP in this regard. METHODS: Of 67 included patients, 63 (94%) underwent colonoscopy with biopsy sampling. Fecal EPX, F-ECP, FC, F-MPO, S-EPX, and S-ECP were analyzed. RESULTS: Diagnostic outcome: normal: n = 46 (73%), CC: n = 9 (14%), LC: n = 4 (6%), UC: n = 2 (3%), CD: n = 2 (3%). Higher levels of F-EPX and F-ECP were found in CC compared to a normal diagnostic outcome (p = 0.01). No change was noted in any of the fecal markers in LC. When all of the fecal markers were normal the probability of a normal diagnostic outcome was 92%. We found no differences in S-EPX and S-ECP between the groups. CONCLUSION: Elevated F-EPX and F-ECP could predict CC. None of the fecal markers predicted LC. Serum-EPX and S-ECP are not useful for the diagnosis of CC, LC, UC, or CD. With normal levels in all of the analyzed fecal markers, there is a low probability of a pathologic diagnostic outcome.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Medically intractable pediatric ulcerative colitis can lead to colectomy after which patients commonly receive an ileoanal pouch. Postoperative complications are more common in patients with Crohn disease, a diagnosis that may be rendered after the colectomy specimen is examined. Because most children are likely to be exposed to medications before colectomy, we sought to examine whether such exposure influences the distribution of the inflammation within the resected colon and therefore potentially raise questions about the diagnosis accuracy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 32 pediatric ulcerative colitis cases undergoing colectomy from 2007 to 2014 for clinical data and precolectomy treatment history. The resected colon histology was reviewed independently by 2 blinded pathologists. The acute/active inflammation was scored using the modified Riley score for 3 colonic segments (proximal, transverse, and distal colon) for each patient. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate possible association between acute/active inflammation scores at various sites and medication use. RESULTS: Twelve cases (38%) showed decreasing acute inflammation score distally to proximally, 8 (25%) had increasing scores, and 12 cases showed no change. Patients were most commonly exposed to corticosteroids, followed by anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies. There was no statistically or clinically significant change in the histologic scores across the colonic segments of the resected colon in association with exposure to any specific medication or combination of medications, sex, age at diagnosis and surgery, or duration of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Precolectomy therapy does not seem to influence the distribution of inflammation within the resected colon.},

   abstract = {Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A significant proportion of children with ASD and gastrointestinal symptoms have histologic evidence of ileocolitis (inflammation of the terminal ileum and/or colon). We previously reported the molecular characterization of gastrointestinal biopsy tissue from ASD children with ileocolitis (ASDIC+) compared to anatomically similar inflamed tissue from typically developing children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; i.e. Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) and typically developing children with gastrointestinal symptoms but no evidence of gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation (TDIC-). ASDIC+ children had a gene expression profile that, while primarily overlapping with known IBD, had distinctive differences. The present study confirms these findings and replicates this molecular characterization in a second cohort of cases (ASDIC+) and controls (TDIC-). In these two separate case/control mucosal-based cohorts, we have demonstrated overlap of 59 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) unique to inflamed ileocolonic tissue from symptomatic ASDIC+ children. We now report that 9 of these 59 transcripts are also differentially expressed in the peripheral blood of the second cohort of ASDIC+ children. This set of transcripts represents a putative blood-based biomarker for ASD-associated ileocolonic inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIM: Dietary carbohydrate and protein intake is generally thought as risk factors for onset of ulcerative colitis (UC), while epidemiological data had been controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the role of carbohydrate and protein intake in the development of UC. METHODS: Comprehensive search in PubMed and Embase was conducted to identify all relevant studies, and the role of carbohydrate and protein intake in the development of UC was quantitatively assessed by dose-response meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nine studies (5 case-control and 4 prospective cohort) were identified with a total of 975 UC cases and 239352 controls. The summary relative risks (RR) for per 10 g increment/day were 1.005 (95%CI: 0.991-1.019, I2 = 31.5%, n = 5) for total carbohydrate intake, 1.001 (95%CI: 0.971-1.032, I2 = 0.0%, n = 7) for the subtype of fiber intake, 1.029 (95%CI: 0.962-1.101, I2 = 68.9%, n = 2) for the subtype of sugar intake, and 1.010 (95%CI: 0.975-1.047, I2 = 12.4%, n = 7) for total protein intake. Among sugar subtypes, only sucrose intake was found positively related with UC risk (RR for per 10 g increment/day: 1.098, 95%CI: 1.024-1.177, I2 = 0.0%, n = 3). No evidence of a non-linear dose-response association was found between the nutrient intake and UC risk, except for the subtype of sucrose (P for non-linear trend = 0.032). Subgroup analyses showed consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggested a lack of association between dietary carbohydrate or protein intake and the risk of UC, except for the subtype of sucrose which played a significant role in the development of UC. Large-scale prospective designed studies are needed to confirm our findings.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a risk factor for vitamin B12 deficiency due to frequent involvement of the terminal ileum. Conventional screening for B12 deficiency with serum B12 is relatively insensitive and measures total B12 concentration, of which a minority is present in a biologically active form. Holotranscobalamin (holoTC) combined with methylmalonic acid (MMA) is believed to be more accurate in identifying impaired B12 status. We evaluated the prevalence and risk factors for B12 deficiency using holoTC supported by MMA among patients with CD. METHODS: We performed a single-center service evaluation of 381 patients with CD who underwent B12 assessment (holoTC/MMA) and compared them with 141 patients with ulcerative colitis. Eighty-nine patients with CD underwent paired serum B12 and holoTC. Among patients with CD, risk factors including terminal ileal resection length, ileal inflammation on endoscopy, and disease characteristics on magnetic resonance imaging were recorded. RESULTS: Prevalence of B12 deficiency among patients with CD was 33% compared with 16% in ulcerative colitis (P < 0.0001). In 89 patients who underwent paired tests, conventional testing identified B12 deficiency in 5% of patients with CD, which increased to 32% using holoTC/MMA. Independent risk factors for B12 deficiency were ileal resection length </=20 cm (odds ratio: 3.0, 95% confidence interval, 1.5-6.0, P = 0.002) and >20 cm (odds ratio: 6.7, 95% confidence interval, 3.0-14.7, P < 0.0001) and ileal inflammation (odds ratio: 3.9, 95% confidence interval, 2.2-6.9, P < 0.0001). On magnetic resonance imaging, active terminal ileal inflammation (P = 0.02) and an increased disease burden (>/=1 skip lesion, P = 0.01 and prestenotic dilatation >3 cm, P = 0.01) were associated with B12 deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in patients with CD. holoTC supported by MMA identifies patients with B12 deficiency considered replete on conventional testing.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thioguanine (TG) is efficacious in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but its toxicity, particularly nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver, has limited its use. We assessed the long-term clinical outcomes and safety of TG in patients whom were intolerant or refractory to conventional immunomodulators. METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-centre study of IBD patients treated with TG from 2001-2013. Response was defined as clinical remission (Harvey-Bradshaw Index < 5 for Crohn's disease (CD), Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index < 4 for ulcerative colitis (UC)) without corticosteroids or, if receiving anti-tumour-necrosis-factor (anti-TNF) therapy, absence of dose escalation. We recorded TG failure, withdrawal and adverse events. Patients were monitored with biochemistry, liver biopsy and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: 54 patients (47 CD and 7 UC) whom received TG (mean dose: 27 mg/d (range: 20-40 mg/d)) as monotherapy (n = 36) or concomitantly with anti-TNF (n = 18) for a median inter-quartile range of 16 (5-37) months (126 patient-years of follow-up). 32 (59%) patients responded to TG at 6 months and 23 (43%) at 12 months. Pancreatitis did not recur amongst the 19 patients with prior thiopurine-induced pancreatitis. 16 (30%) patients ceased TG due to intolerance or toxicity (four serious); NRH was not observed. 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentrations did not correlate with efficacy nor with toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: TG was efficacious and well tolerated in one out of two patients who had previously failed conventional immunomodulators. NRH did not occur.},

We also aimed to describe the psychological profile of this group, assess predictors of disease and the impact of IBD-FAPD on quality of life. METHODS: This cross-sectional prospective study included patients aged 8-18 years with a diagnosis of IBD. Disease activity was assessed by physician's global assessment, laboratory studies, and aPCDAI or PUCAI scoring. Age appropriate validated questionnaires were used to diagnose FAPDs according to the Rome III criteria, depression, anxiety symptoms and quality of life. RESULTS: There were 128 patients recruited. Eighty-one (63%) completed questionnaires (36 females; 45 males; mean age 14.4 +/- 2.6 years) (62 Crohn's disease [CD], 19 ulcerative colitis [UC]). The prevalence of IBD-FAPD in clinical remission was 26% (17 CD, 4 UC; 95% CI: 20.6% - 79.4%), with significantly more females having IBD-FAPD (p=0.038). Anxiety symptoms were in 14.3% of IBD-FAPD patients (p=0.06) and depression in 23.8% (p=0.006). The average Peds QoL-GI score for the IBD-FAPD group was significantly lower than those without FAPDs (71 vs. 86.5, p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, the prevalence of IBD-FAPD was 26 %. This is the first study to assess all FAPDs using the Rome III criteria and to demonstrate increased anxiety, depression and worse quality of life in children with IBD-FAPD. The identification of patients predisposed to IBD-FAPD may allow implementing strategies that could improve symptoms and quality of life.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are chronic, life-long, and relapsing diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Currently, there are no complete cure possibilities, but combined pharmacological and nutritional therapy may induce remission of the disease. Malnutrition and specific nutritional deficiencies are frequent among IBD patients, so the majority of them need nutritional treatment, which not only improves the state of nutrition of the patients but has strong anti-inflammatory activity as well. Moreover, some nutrients, from early stages of life are suspected as triggering factors in the etiopathogenesis of IBD. Both parenteral and enteral nutrition is used in IBD therapy, but their practical utility in different populations and in different countries is not clearly established, and there are sometimes conflicting theories concerning the role of nutrition in IBD. This review presents the actual data from research studies on the influence of nutrition on the etiopathogenesis of IBD and the latest findings regarding its mechanisms of action. The use of both parenteral and enteral nutrition as therapeutic methods in induction and maintenance therapy in IBD treatment is also extensively discussed. Comparison of the latest research data, scientific theories concerning the role of nutrition in IBD, and different opinions about them are also presented and discussed. Additionally, some potential future perspectives for nutritional therapy are highlighted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tobacco use patterns and effects in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease have been extensively studied, however the role and patterns of cannabis use remains poorly defined. Our aim was to evaluate patterns of marijuana use in a large population based survey. METHODS: Cases were identified from the NHANES database from the National Center for Health Statistics for the time period from January, 2009 through December, 2010 as having ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, and exact matched with controls using the Propensity Score Module of SPSS, based on age, gender, and sample weighted using the nearest neighbor method. RESULTS: After weighting, 2084,895 subjects with IBD and 2013,901 control subjects were identified with no significant differences in demographic characteristics. Subjects with IBD had a higher incidence of ever having used marijuana/hashish (M/H) (67.3% vs. 60.0%) and an earlier age of onset of M/H use (15.7 years vs. 19.6 years). Patients with IBD were less likely to have used M/H every month for a year, but more likely to use a heavier amount per day (64.9% subjects with IBD used three or more joints per day vs. 80.5% of subjects without IBD used two or fewer joints per day). In multivariable logistic regression, presence of IBD, male gender, and age over 40 years predicted M/H use. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to evaluate marijuana patterns in a large-scale population based survey. Older, male IBD patients have the highest odds of marijuana use.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Malnutrition, protein-energy, and micronutrient deficiencies are common among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The deficiencies are a manifestation of the complicated disease and a cause of morbidity. The present review summarizes recent advances and evidence-based knowledge regarding micronutrients in relation to patients with IBD. RECENT FINDINGS: Micronutrient deficiencies occur in more than half of patients with IBD. Most common are deficiencies of iron, B12, vitamin D, vitamin K, folic acid, selenium, zinc, vitamin B6, and vitamin B1. Deficiencies are more common in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis, and more in active disease than at times of remission. Micronutrient deficiency is associated with prolonged and complicated course of disease. Iron deficiency is the most common cause for anemia. Definite diagnosis of B12 deficiency cannot be established by serum levels alone. Vitamin D and vitamin K deficiencies are thought to be associated with heightened inflammatory state. The relationship of these deficiencies with bone disease is controversial. The present review focuses on the significance, epidemiology, treatment options, and recommendations regarding micronutrient deficiencies in IBD. SUMMARY: Micronutrient deficiencies are common and have clinical significance. High suspicion for micronutrient deficiencies is advocated so that treatable causes of morbidity are treated appropriately and late and irreversible sequlae are prevented.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Transition may be associated with poor health outcomes, but limited data exist regarding inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Acquisition of self-management skills is believed to be important to this process. IBD-specific checklists of such skills have been developed to aid in transition, but none has been well studied or validated. This study aimed to describe self-assessment ability to perform tasks on one of these checklists and to explore the relation between patient age and disease duration. METHODS: Patients ages 10 to 21 years with IBD were recruited. An iPad survey queried the patients for self-assessment of ability to perform specific self-management tasks. Task categories included basic knowledge of IBD, doctor visits, medications and other treatments, and disease management. Associations with age and disease duration were tested with Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients (31 boys) with Crohn disease (n = 40), ulcerative colitis (n = 25), and indeterminate colitis (n = 2) participated in the study. Mean patient age was 15.8 +/- 2.5 years, with median disease duration of 5 years (2 months-14 years). The proportion of patients who self-reported ability to complete a task without help increased with age for most tasks, including "telling others my diagnosis" (rho = 0.43, P = 0.003), "telling medical staff I do not like or am having trouble following a treatment" (rho = 0.37, P = 0.003), and "naming my medications" (rho = 0.28, P = 0.02). No task significantly improved with disease duration. CONCLUSIONS: Self-assessment of ability to perform some key tasks of transition appears to improve with age, but not with disease duration. More important, communication with the medical team did not improve with age, despite being of critical importance to functioning within an adult care model.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of nutritional status disorders in children with ulcerative colitis (UC) is much lower than in the case of Crohn's disease (CD). The largest variability in the components of body composition occurs at the time of a new diagnosis and in periods of disease exacerbation. AIM: Assessment of body composition in children with UC and CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The preliminary study included 59 children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (34 children with UC vs. 25 children with CD) aged 4-18 years. The final analysis included 26 newly diagnosed children (16 children with UC vs. 10 children with CD). The evaluation of body composition was conducted by means of BIA-101 bioimpedance analyser. RESULTS: Decreased values of lean mass were found in children with newly diagnosed IBD (UC: 41.13 kg vs. control group: 42.06 kg; CD: 35.50 kg vs. control group: 45.50 kg). After a year interval, an increase in fat (UC 1: 7.67 kg vs. UC 2: 10.33 kg; CD 1: 7.36 kg vs. CD 2: 9.47 kg) as well as lean body mass (UC 1: 35.22 kg vs. UC 2: 39.00 kg; CD 1: 35.99 kg vs. CD 2: 42.41 kg) was found in children. CONCLUSIONS: Children with newly diagnosed IBD were highly vulnerable to nutritional status disturbances. The increase in fat and lean body mass in an annual interval may be due to the treatment regime and control of the children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with increased dietary intake of fat and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Modification of fat metabolism may alter inflammation and disease severity. Our aim was to assess differences in dietary and serum fatty acid levels between control and UC subjects and associations with disease activity and inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: Dietary histories, serum, and colonic tissue samples were prospectively collected from 137 UC subjects and 38 controls. Both histologic injury and the Mayo Disease Activity Index were assessed. Serum and tissue cytokines were measured by Luminex assay. Serum fatty acids were obtained by gas chromatography. RESULTS: UC subjects had increased total fat and oleic acid (OA) intake, but decreased arachidonic acid (AA) intake vs controls. In serum, there was less percent saturated fatty acid (SFA) and AA, with higher monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), linoleic acid, OA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) in UC. Tissue cytokine levels were directly correlated with SFA and inversely correlated with PUFA, EPA, and DPA in UC subjects, but not controls. 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy blunted these associations. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we found differences in serum fatty acids in UC subjects that correlated with pro-inflammatory tissue cytokines. We propose that fatty acids may affect cytokine production and thus be immunomodulatory in UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease-unclassified (IBD-U) is diagnosed in approximately 10% of pediatric and adolescent onset IBD patients. The EUROKIDS registry (2004) initiated by the Porto IBD working group of ESPGHAN prospectively monitors diagnostic workup of newly diagnosed pediatric and adolescent onset IBD patients. We aimed to describe diagnostic workup, phenotype, and change of diagnosis over time in pediatric IBD-U patients. METHODS: Data were collected on children from 52 centers across 20 European countries and Israel, diagnosed with IBD from May 2005 through November 2013. Full endoscopy plus small bowel radiology was considered complete diagnostic workup. Participating centers reporting IBD-U patients were queried in 2014 for follow-up data. RESULTS: IBD-U was the provisional first diagnosis in 265 of 3461 children (7.7%) (91/158 [58%] with pancolitis; 140 [53%] male), diagnosed more frequently under the age of 10 (median age 12.3 years, 89 [34%] under 10 years). Half (48%) had undergone complete diagnostic workup. Lack of small bowel radiology was the prevailing reason for incomplete workup. As a result of reinvestigations (endoscopy in 54%, radiology in 38%) during a median follow-up of 5.7 years (interquartile range, 2.5-7.8), a change in diagnosis from IBD-U to Crohn's disease (12%) or ulcerative colitis (20%) was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Only half of patients reported as IBD-U in EUROKIDS had undergone complete diagnostic workup. Follow-up with reinvestigations resulted in a reduction of IBD-U rate to 5.6%. A diagnosis of IBD-U becomes less likely in case of complete diagnostic workup. Implementation of clear diagnostic criteria will further reduce the rate of IBD-U in the future.},

Inflammation appears to be a major contributor in perpetuating a dysregulated gut microbiota. Although current drug therapies can significantly induce and maintain disease remission, there is no cure for these diseases. Nevertheless, ongoing human studies investigating dietary fibre interventions may potentially prove to exert beneficial outcomes for IBD. Postulated mechanisms include direct interactions with the gut mucosa through immunomodulation, or indirectly through the microbiome. Component species of the microbiome may degrade dietary-fibre polysaccharides and ferment the products to form short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate. Prebiotic dietary fibres may also act more directly by altering the composition of the microbiome. Longer term benefits in reducing the risk of more aggressive disease or colorectal cancer may require other dietary fibre sources such as wheat bran or psyllium. By critically examining clinical trials that have used dietary fibre supplements or dietary patterns containing specific types or amounts of dietary fibres, it may be possible to assess whether varying the intake of specific dietary fibres may offer an efficient treatment for IBD patients.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the 2 major phenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which are influenced by a complex interplay of immunological and genetic elements, though the precise etiology still remains unknown. With IBD developing into a globally prevailing disease, there is a need to explore new targets and a thorough understanding of the pathophysiological differences between the healthy and diseased gut could unearth new therapeutic opportunities. In this review, we provide an overview of the major aspects of IBD pathogenesis and thereafter present a comprehensive analysis of the gut pathophysiology leading to a discussion on some of the most promising targets and biologic therapies currently being explored. These include various gut proteins (CXCL-10, GATA-3, NKG2D, CD98, microRNAs), immune cells recruited to the gut (mast cells, eosinophils, toll-like receptors 2, 4), dysregulated proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, -13, -18, -21), and commensal microbiota (probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation). We also evaluate some of the emerging nonconventional therapies being explored in IBD treatment focusing on the latest developments in stem cell research, oral targeting of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, novel anti-inflammatory signaling pathway targeting, adenosine deaminase inhibition, and the beneficial effects of antioxidant and nutraceutical therapies. In addition, we highlight the growth of biologics and their targets in IBD by providing information on the preclinical and clinical development of over 60 biopharmaceuticals representing the state of the art in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease drug development.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are at increased risk for small bowel or colorectal cancers (colitis-associated cancers [CACs]). We compared the spectrum of genomic alterations in CACs with those of sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs) and investigated differences between CACs from patients with CD vs UC. METHODS: We studied tumor tissues from patients with CACs treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center or Weill Cornell Medical College from 2003 through 2015. We performed hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing analysis of >300 cancer-related genes to comprehensively characterize genomic alterations. RESULTS: We performed genomic analyses of 47 CACs (from 29 patients with UC and 18 with CD; 43 primary tumors and 4 metastases). Primary tumors developed in the ileum (n = 2), right colon (n = 18), left colon (n = 6), and rectosigmoid or rectum (n = 21). We found genomic alterations in TP53, IDH1, and MYC to be significantly more frequent, and mutations in APC to be significantly less frequent, than those reported in sporadic CRCs by The Cancer Genome Atlas or Foundation Medicine. We identified genomic alterations that might be targeted by a therapeutic agent in 17 of 47 (36%) CACs. These included the mutation encoding IDH1 R132; amplification of FGFR1, FGFR2, and ERBB2; and mutations encoding BRAF V600E and an EML4-ALK fusion protein. Alterations in IDH1 and APC were significantly more common in CACs from patients with CD than UC. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of CACs from 47 patients, we found significant differences in the spectrum of genomic alterations in CACs compared with sporadic CRCs. We observed a high frequency of IDH1 R132 mutations in patients with CD but not UC, as well as a high frequency of MYC amplification in CACs. Many genetic alterations observed in CACs could serve as therapeutic targets.},

   abstract = {Background. Patients with UC have shown an important defect in the secretion and maintenance of the mucosal barrier as part of inadequate expression of mucin genes. The aim of the present study was to determine the expression of MUC12, MUC16, and MUC20 in colonic tissue from patients with UC in regard to their clinical outcomes. Methods. We included a total of 40 patients with UC and 30 normal controls. Mucin gene expression was performed by RT-PCR and protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. Results. Patients with active UC showed no significant expression of MUC12 gene in mucosa compared to the group of patients with UC in remission and the normal control group. MUC16 gene expression was significantly increased in the UC active and remission groups compared to the normal control group (P = 0.03). MUC20 gene expression was found significantly decreased in patients with active UC compared to both remission group (P = 0.001) and normal controls (P = 0.001). Furthermore, an association was found between MUC20 gene expression and the presence of histological remission in patients with UC (P = 0.003, OR = 0.37). Conclusions. An increased gene expression of MUC16 and MUC20 was found in patients with remission UC.},

There is a need to raise awareness in gastroenterologists and the population in general, so that early diagnosis and treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD) can be carried out. It is important for all physicians to have homogeneous criteria regarding the diagnosis and treatment of IBD in Latin America.

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic condition of unknown etiology and a polygenic disease. The interleukin 27 (IL-27) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases including inflammatory bowel disease. Several polymorphisms of IL-27 have been associated with several types of cancer and immune disorders. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between IL-27 gene polymorphisms and the development of UC. Four polymorphisms of IL-27p28 gene (rs181206, rs26528, rs17855750, and rs40837) and three of the Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3) (rs428253, rs4740, and rs4905) were genotyped by 5' exonuclease TaqMan genotyping assays on an ABI Prism 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System in 375 Mexican patients with UC and 1599 Mexican Mestizo healthy unrelated individuals. IL-27 levels were determined in 458 healthy controls. Under recessive model adjusted by age and gender, the IL-27p28 rs17855750 polymorphism was associated with decreased risk of developing UC (OR=0.27, 95% CI: 0.06-1.13, P=0.031). On the other hand, under recessive models adjusted by age and gender, the EBI3 rs428253 (OR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.29-0.99, P=0.035), rs4740 (OR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.36-1.01, P=0.046) and rs4905 (OR=0.59, 95% CI: 0.35-1.01, P=0.043) were associated with decreased risk of developing UC. Similar levels of IL-27 were observed among the genotypes of the studied polymorphisms. IL-27 polymorphisms might play a protective role for the development of UC in the Mexican population.},

Currently, some IL-22 polymorphisms have been associated with inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis vulgaris, but there are no studies on UC. AIM: The aim of this work was to study the frequency of polymorphisms of IL-22 in Mexican patients with UC. METHODS: We studied a total of 199 Mexican patients with confirmed UC and 697 healthy controls. All individuals were born in Mexico, at least three family generations earlier. A blood sample was obtained from the UC patients and healthy controls in order to perform DNA extraction and then to determine the frequency of IL-22 polymorphisms (rs2227485, rs2272478, rs2227491). RESULTS: No statistical significance was found in the gene and genotype frequencies of three SNPs of IL-22 (rs2227485, rs2272478, rs2227491) between the UC patients and healthy controls. No association was found between those IL-22 SNPs and clinical features of UC. CONCLUSIONS: There was no association between IL-22 SNPs (rs2227485, rs2272478, rs2227491) and the development of UC in a Mexican population.},

No previous study in Mexico has evaluated this issue; our aim was to evaluate its frequency, clinical characteristics and factors associated with its presence in Mexican patients with UC and IPAA. METHODS: Retrospective-cohort study including 70 patients with histopathological diagnosis of UC and IPAA between 1983 and 2014 from inflammatory bowel disease clinic of a tertiary care center. The statistical analysis used descriptive statistics, chi-square and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Student's t test for numeric variables. Univariate analysis was performed to identify the factors associated. RESULTS: Patients presenting with pouchitis accounted for 48.6%. From the 34 cases, 12 (35.3%) had inactive pouchitis; 7 (20.6%) active acute pouchitis; 15 (44.1%) chronic active pouchitis. On average, pouchitis occurred 5.37 years after IPPA. Factors probably associated with its occurrence were the presence of autoimmune concomitant diseases (ACDs; p = 0.06, OR 4.40, 95% CI 0.84-22.9) and extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs; p = 0.05, OR 2.53, 95% CI 0.96-6.64), which was also probably associated with chronic active pouchitis (p = 0.06, OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.07-1.31). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of pouchitis is high in Mexican UC patients after IPAA. ACDs and EIMs were probably associated with its development.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is controversy about whether levels of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and antidrug antibodies (ADAs) are accurate determinants of loss of response to therapy. We analyzed the association between trough levels of anti-TNF agents or ADAs and outcomes of interventions for patients with loss of response to infliximab or adalimumab. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of pediatric and adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease and suspected loss of response to anti-TNF agents treated at medical centers throughout Israel from October 2009 through February 2013. We examined the correlation between outcomes of different interventions and trough levels of drug or ADAs during loss of response. An additional subanalysis was performed including only patients with a definite inflammatory loss of response (clinical worsening associated with increased levels of C-reactive protein or fecal calprotectin, or detection of inflammation by endoscopy, fistula discharge, or imaging studies). RESULTS: Among 247 patients (42 with ulcerative colitis), there were 330 loss-of-response events (188 to infliximab and 142 to adalimumab). Trough levels of adalimumab greater than 4.5 mcg/mL and infliximab greater than 3.8 mcg/mL identified patients who failed to respond to an increase in drug dosage or a switch to another anti-TNF agent with 90% specificity; these were set as adequate trough levels. Adequate trough levels identified patients who responded to expectant management or out-of-class interventions with more than 75% specificity. Levels of antibodies against adalimumab >4 microgram per mL equivalent (mcg/mL-eq) or antibodies against infliximab >9 mcg/mL-eq identified patients who did not respond to an increased drug dosage with 90% specificity. Patients with high titers of ADAs had longer durations of response when anti-TNF agents were switched than when dosage was increased (P = .03; log-rank test), although dosage increases were more effective for patients with no or low titers of ADAs (P = .02). An analysis of definite inflammatory loss-of-response events (n = 244) produced similar results; patients with adequate trough levels had a longer duration of response when they switched to a different class of agent than when anti-TNF was optimized by either a dosage increase or by a switch within the anti-TNF class (P = .002; log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective analysis suggest that trough levels of drug or ADAs may guide therapeutic decisions for more than two-thirds of inflammatory bowel disease patients with either clinically suspected or definite inflammatory loss of response to therapy.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing, and refractory disorder of the intestine. Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the preferred and standard surgical procedure for patients' refractory to medical therapy. Pouchitis is one of the most common long-term complications after IPAA. In the present study, the safety and efficacy of Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI (CBM) as a probiotic were examined. METHODS: A randomized and placebo-controlled study was performed. Seventeen patients were recruited from 2007 to 2013. Nine tablets of MIYA-BM((R)) or placebo were orally administered once daily. The cumulative pouchitis-free survival, pouch condition (using the modified pouch disease activity index), and blood parameters were evaluated. A fecal sample analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Subjects were randomly allocated to receive MIYA-BM or placebo (9 and 8 subjects, respectively). One subject in the MIYA-BM group and four subjects in the placebo group developed pouchitis. No side effects occurred in either group. Characteristic intestinal flora was observed in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that probiotic therapy with CBM achieved favorable results with minimal side effects and might be a useful complementary therapy for the prevention of pouchitis in patients with UC who have undergone IPAA.},

IBD is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract and includes Crohn's Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). IBD has increasing incidence and prevalence in most of countries and becomes a global emerging disease. A westernized lifestyle or habits and some environmental factors have been found to contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD. The relevant risk factors include Smoking, hygiene hypothesis, microorganisms, appendectomy, medication, nutrition, and stress have all been found to be associated with the modality of IBD, but results are inconsistent on this issue in available studies. Therefore, more studies are required to identify and understand the environmental determinants of IBD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare condition that can be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to evaluate PSC and its association with IBD in children. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 13 pediatric patients (<18 years) with PSC treated at Asan Medical Center between June 1989 and December 2013. Clinical findings and long-term outcomes were investigated. During the same period, the incidence of PSC among IBD patients was evaluated among 600 Crohn disease (CD) and 210 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. RESULTS: All 13 study patients diagnosed with PSC also presented with IBD. Eleven boys and two girls with a median age of 15.0 years old (9.0-17.8 years) were included. The cumulative incidence of PSC for UC was 5.7% (12 of 210) and 0.2% for CD (1 of 600), respectively. PSC occurred during follow-up for IBD for five patients (38.5%) whereas, IBD developed during follow-up for PSC for two patients (15.4%), and was diagnosed during the initial work-up for PSC for 6 patients (46.2%). For the 77.3 month median follow-up period, 9/13 patients (69.2%), neither the clinical symptoms nor blood test results worsened. Two cases (15.4%) developed liver cirrhosis and underwent liver transplantation. Among 13 PSC patients with IBD, two (15.4%) developed colorectal cancer, and no one developed cholangiocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: All patients with PSC in this study had associated IBD. The incidence of PSC was not rare compared to reports in adults. PSC should be considered during the management of IBD and vice versa in children.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) present commonly in childhood, with unknown etiology, but an important role for the epithelial lining is suggested. Epithelial cell extrusion, measured by counting gaps between epithelial cells, is higher in adult patients with Crohn disease (CD) than in controls. Our objectives were to compare epithelial gaps in the duodenum of IBD and non-IBD pediatric patients, to study the correlation between epithelial gaps, inflammation, and disease activity, and identify potential mechanisms. METHODS: Epithelial gap density of the duodenum was evaluated using probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy in 26 pediatric patients with IBD (16 CD, 10 ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 17 non-IBD controls during endoscopy. Epithelial gaps were correlated with serum inflammatory markers, disease activity indices, and intraepithelial lymphocytes. A panel of 10 inflammatory cytokines and expression of TNFAIP3 (A20; inhibits NF-kappabeta-induced inflammation) were analyzed in duodenal and ileal biopsies. RESULTS: Confocal imaging showed significantly higher epithelial gap density in patients with IBD, including UC. Interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-8 were higher in duodenal but not ileal biopsies of patients with UC. No significant correlation was present between C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, disease activity indices, and epithelial gaps in patients with UC. In patients with CD, C-reactive protein positively correlated with epithelial gaps. A20 expression in the duodenum was unchanged among non-IBD and IBD cases. CONCLUSIONS: Duodenal epithelial gaps are increased in pediatric patients with IBD (including UC) but are unrelated to inflammation. This suggests that altered epithelial barrier is an important systemic feature of pediatric IBD and is not only secondary to inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic pediatric disorders. Changes in vasculature are described in IBD but these could be secondary to inflammation and the role in pathogenesis is poorly understood. Assessing circulatory changes in typically unaffected sites in IBD (e.g., duodenum), when inflammation is absent, can identify vascular changes associated with pathogenesis. AIM: To measure capillary flow rates in duodenal mucosa using probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) during endoscopy in children with IBD. METHODS: Images of villi with visible blood vessels obtained using pCLE were captured as video sequences. Capillary flow rate (mm/s) was calculated by dividing the distance travelled by blood cells by the duration of the sequence. Flow rates were correlated with various clinical parameters. RESULTS: Forty-five patients (22 non-IBD, 14 CD, 9 UC) were included in the study. Duodenal capillary flow rates were significantly higher in UC patients (0.75 +/- 0.07 mm/s) as compared to non-IBD (0.57 +/- 0.03) and CD patients (0.65 +/- 0.04). There was no correlation between serum hemoglobin and albumin, disease activity indices, serum inflammatory markers, and capillary flow rates in patients. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows, for the first time, increased capillary blood flow in the duodenum of UC patients that was unrelated to inflammatory markers or disease activity. Thus, early vascular changes can be assessed using pCLE during endoscopy.},

However, the immunoregulatory and epithelial barrier protective properties of C-BF have not been reported. Inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, can lead to colon cancer, the third most common malignant tumor. The objective is to develop the new found cathelicidin-BF as a therapeutic to patients of ulcerative colitis. The morphology of the colon epithelium was observed by H&E staining; apoptosis index and infiltration of inflammatory cells in colonic epithelium were measured by TUNEL and immunohistochemistry; the expression level of endogenous mCRAMP was analyzed by immunofluorescence; and phosphorylation of the transcription factors c-jun and NF-kappaB in colon were analyzed by Western blot. Our results showed that the morphology of the colon epithelium in the C-BF+DSS group was improved compared with the DSS group. Apoptosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in colonic epithelium were also significantly attenuated in the C-BF+DSS group compared with the DSS group, and the expression level of endogenous mCRAMP in the DSS group was significantly higher than other groups. DSS-induced phosphorylation level of c-jun and NF-kappaB while C-BF effectively inhibited phosphorylation of NF-kappaB (p65). The barrier protective effect of C-BF was still excellent. In conclusion, C-BF effectively attenuated inflammation and improved disrupted barrier function. Notably, this is the first report to demonstrate that C-BF attenuates DSS-induced UC both through the regulation of intestinal immune and retention of barrier function, and the exact pathway was through NF-kappaB.},

This study evaluated body composition in adult patients with UC and the associations of body composition with disease activity and surgical intervention. METHODS: This study included 99 patients with UC, 105 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 60 controls. Skeletal muscle area (SMA), visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) of the third lumbar vertebrae were evaluated by abdominal computed tomography. The effects of medical therapy and surgery on body composition in UC patients were determined. RESULTS: Sarcopenia was more frequent in UC patients (27.3%) than in controls (8.3%), but less frequent than in CD patients (59.0%). The prevalence of sarcopenia was significantly higher (33.8% vs. 4.5%, p < 0.001), and SMA (144.26 vs. 182.32 cm2, p < 0.001), skeletal muscle index (SMI) (52.22 vs. 65.52 cm2/m2, p < 0.001) significantly lower, in UC patients with high (>/=6) than low (<6) Mayo score, but SFA and VFA were similar. The prevalence of sarcopenia and alterations in body composition were reversed, along with UC disease activity, following medical treatment or surgery. SMA and SMI correlated significantly with disease activity in UC patients. Multivariate analysis showed that sarcopenia (odds ratio, 8.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.80-40.10; p = 0.007) was a negative predictor of high Mayo score in UC patients. Sarcopenic patients with UC had high probability of need for colectomy in Kaplan-Meier survival curves. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is associated with high disease activity and poor clinical outcome in UC patients. Medical treatment and colectomy have positive effects on sarcopenia and skeletal muscle depletion.},

METHOD: Retrospective analysis of disease spectrum, EN approach, preparation, speed and time as well as adverse reactions and outcomes in 47 pediatric patients with gastrointestinal disease underwent EN therapy during July 2014 to March 2015. The nutrition indicators before and after EN therapy were compared by paired t-test. RESULT: A total of 47 patients were selected, 27 male (57%) and 20 female (43%), aged 0.8 (0.3, 4.0) years, 9 with mechanical or chemical damage to the esophagus, 7 with inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), 6 with chronic diarrhea, 5 with acute pancreatitis, 3 with acute diarrhea and severe malnutrition, 3 with short bowel syndrome, 3 with improper feeding, 3 with feeding difficulties, 3 with protein losing enteropathy, 2 with post-enterostomy, 2 with enterocolitis, 1 with gastroesophageal reflux, were diagnosed. Of 47 cases, 22 were given oral nutrition, 28 were fed with nasogastric tube and 4 with nasojejunal tube feeding, 2 with percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy tube feeding for each. In these tube-feeding cases, 20 cases were treated with continuous infusion and 21 cases with intermittent infusion. Eleven cases were fed with amino acid formula; 21 cases took the choice of peptide formulations; 16 cases chose whole protein formula, including six cases who chose 3.3-4.2 kJ/ml higher energy density formula, 10 cases selected common energy density formula including breast milk. Twenty-one cases suffered from different degrees of adverse reactions, including vomiting in 7 cases, abdominal pain and bloating in 3, diarrhea in 12, secondary respiratory infections in 5. Five patients were discharged after giving up of treatment by parents due to poor efficacy on primary disease; 3 cases were transferred to other departments for further treatment; 15 cases were discharged with a feeding tube for family nutrition and specialist out-patient treatment. The rest 24 cases were all improved and discharged. There were significant differences in nutrition indicators before and after EN, weight-for-age Z score (WAZ)(-2.3+/-1.9 vs. -1.9+/-1.8, t=4.156, P=0.000), weight-for-height Z score (WHZ)(-1.9+/-1.7 vs. -1.2+/-1.5, t=3.714, P=0.001), albumin ((35+/-9)g/L vs.(39+/-6) g/L, t=3.017, P=0.005) and prealbumin ((0.11+/-0.05)g/L vs.(0.18+/-0.07)g/L, t=5.144, P=0.000). CONCLUSION: EN is suitable for a variety of children's digestive diseases, which can improve the nutritional status of the patients and was safe for clinical application. As the implementation of EN is simple and has good compliance, family EN is proven to be feasible.},

Our previous studies showed that beetroot (Beta vulgaris var. rubra) products and their major component betanin modulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) stimulated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils of healthy volunteers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of betanin on the oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis in neutrophils isolated from blood of patients with inflammatory bowel disease--ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The results were compared with those obtained in colon carcinoma-derived Caco-2 cells. Betanin treatment at the concentration of 100 muM for 24 h increased DNA damage assessed by comet assay in IBD patients' neutrophils. A similar effect although less pronounced was observed in Caco-2 cells. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with H2O2 caused a 4-fold increase of DNA strand breaks in comparison to untreated cells, but pre-treatment with betanin reduced DNA damage in these cells. Betanin also induced procaspase-3 cleavage and caspase-3 activity accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, indicating its pro-apoptotic activity. These results suggest that betanin may support mechanisms that lead to the release of ROS and apoptotic cell death. In this way betanin may exert anti-inflammatory and potentially cancer preventive activity.},

   abstract = {Endocytosis is a fundamental cell biological process, which carries out essential functions in a polarized epithelial cell such as enterocytes provided with a huge surface area of the brush border membrane. Major tasks of enterocytes, which are regulated by endocytic signals, are digestion and absorption of nutrients and drugs/pharmacological agents, barrier permeability to microorganism, toxins and antigens, and transcytotic crosstalk between intestinal lumen and lamina propria cells with access to the circulation.Investigations on inflammatory bowel diseases such as food allergy, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis focus on immune processes originating within enterocytes as antigen presenting cells. Thus the initiation of oral tolerance, that is, the binding of food antigens to MHC class II proteins, might be localized within late endosomes of enterocytes. Furthermore, the late endosomal compartment of enterocytes seems to be involved in the processing of luminal antigens during the pathogenesis of celiac disease and inflammatory bowel diseases. Investigations of inherited diseases such as microvillus inclusion disease have revealed a pathogenetic defect in the autophagocytotic and/or recycling pathway of enterocytes.Our progress in the cell and molecular biological understanding of the endocytosis and the methodical opportunities of translational research offer now new therapeutic options for patients suffering from endocytosis-related diseases of enterocytes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adult studies suggest antibodies to infliximab (ATI) correlate with loss of response in inflammatory bowel disease but pediatric data are limited. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of trough infliximab levels and ATI in 134 pediatric and young adult patients receiving infliximab. At the time serum was obtained demographics, disease phenotype, duration of infliximab therapy, use of combination therapy (methotrexate or 6-mercaptopurine with infliximab), and surgery were recorded. RESULTS: Assays were performed on 134 subjects currently receiving infliximab (85 male; mean age, 17.3 +/- 4.3 years; 114 Crohn's disease and 20 ulcerative colitis). Infliximab use ranged from 12 days to 12 years: median 2.0 (interquartile range [1.1-4.3]) years. Twenty-seven of 134 (20%) patients had ATI >/=5 U/mL. Of patients with ATI >/=5 U/mL, 59% had infliximab levels <5 mug/mL, compared with 14% of patients with ATI <5 U/mL (P < 0.001). Ten (7%) patients (9 Crohn's disease, 1 ulcerative colitis) underwent bowel resections after beginning infliximab infusions. Sixty percent who underwent surgery had ATI >/=12 U/mL; in contrast, only 8% of patients who did not undergo surgery had ATI >/=12 U/mL (P = 0.01). At the time of serum sampling, 50 (37%) patients were receiving combination therapy, compared with 84 (63%) on infliximab alone. Combination therapy at the time of serum sampling did not correlate with either increase infliximab levels or lower ATI compared with infliximab monotherapy. However, prior immunomodulator use was associated with lower antibody levels (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: ATI correlates with reduction in infliximab level and a higher risk of surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bile salts likely contribute to liver injury in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) is a bile salt-induced enterokine with hepatoprotective potential as it suppresses de novo bile salt synthesis. Here, we evaluated the bile salt receptor FXR/FGF19 gut-liver axis in PSC and PBC patients. METHODS: Fasted patients with PSC (n = 12) and PBC (n = 10), and healthy controls (HC; n = 10) were orally challenged with the natural FXR agonist chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA 15 mg/kg). Blood was sampled hourly until 8 h afterwards. Serum FGF19 and bile salt excursions were determined. Serum levels of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), reflecting bile salt synthesis, were measured as a biomarker of FGF19 response. RESULTS: Baseline serum FGF19 levels were comparable between groups, while fasted bile salt levels in PSC patients were elevated. Upon CDCA challenge, HC and PBC patients showed a serum FGF19 peak after 4 h followed by a decline. PSC patients showed a prolonged and elevated serum FGF19 response up to 8 h, combined with a sustained serum elevation of CDCA and other bile salts. In general, C4 levels declined following FGF19 elevation. In PSC patients with less favorable prognosis, baseline C4 levels were drastically suppressed and did not further decline. CONCLUSION: Following an oral CDCA challenge, PSC patients showed an impaired clearance of CDCA and a prolonged serum FGF19 response. FXR agonist therapy in PSC could cause prolonged exposure to elevated levels of FGF19, and we propose careful monitoring for detrimental side effects in patient studies.},

   abstract = {IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), where CD (Crohn's disease) and UC (ulcerative colitis) represent the two main forms, are chronic inflammatory conditions of the intestine. Macrophages play a central role in IBD pathogenesis and are regulated by major differentiation factors such as CSF-1 (colony-stimulating factor 1) in homoeostasis and inflammation. IL (interleukin)-34 has recently been discovered as a second ligand for CSF-1R (CSF-1 receptor). However, expression and involvement of IL-34 in IBD remain unknown. In the present paper, we investigated the expression of IL34, CSF1 and their shared receptor CSF1R in normal human ileum and colon, in inflamed and non-inflamed tissues of CD and UC patients, and in a mouse model of experimental colitis. We found distinct expression patterns of IL34 and CSF1 in ileum and colon, with higher IL34 in ileum and, in contrast, higher CSF1 in colon. Furthermore, IL34 and CSF1 expression was increased with inflammation in IBD patients and in experimental colitis. In humans, infiltrating cells of the lamina propria and intestinal epithelial cells expressed IL-34, and TNF-alpha (tumour necrosis factor alpha) regulated IL-34 expression in intestinal epithelial cells through the NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) pathway. These data demonstrate the expression pattern of IL-34 in ileum and colon and suggest IL-34 as a new modulator of inflammation in IBD.},
